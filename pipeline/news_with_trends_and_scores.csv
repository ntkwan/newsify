"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. At Chanel’s Paris Fashion Week show on Tuesday, South African singer Tyla arrived at the Grand Palais in a hot pink tweed mini skirt, a strapless bustier top and matching jacket, paired with a dripping Y-shaped necklace that spelled “Chanel” out both horizontally and vertically. While many other show attendees including musician Raye and actor Simone Ashley dutifully donned a bouclé skirt suit — one of the label’s signature styles — there was no ignoring Tyla’s Barbie-coded version. From the monogrammed gold “CC” buttons to the chain hem circling the bottom of her top, Tyla’s fuchsia three-piece was filled with classic “Chanelisms” that harked back to what some regard as a more distinctive era of the brand. The cut and colour echoed a tweed dress once worn by Naomi Campbell for the house’s Spring-Summer 1994 show. “I wanted to feel like a classic rich Chanel girl,” Tyla told Vogue. On the runway, Chanel also reimagined its hallowed tweed skirt suit with bursts of tulle, floor-length hem-lines and necklines slashed off-the-shoulder. Tyla’s ensemble was prim yet playful — a balanced alternative to the prevailing “officecore” trend seen throughout the Paris shows. Stella McCartney staged her runway in an open-plan office with guests sitting at desks equipped with stationery, while Balenciaga took a more pared-back approach with its collection of crumpled and moth-ravaged suits. But if the thought of reaching for pinstripes and charcoal twill after 5 o’clock fills you with dread rather than desire, the bold skirt suit may offer a happy medium between our evident interest in more structured tailoring without the commitment of dressing like a “Severance” extra. Consider the canary yellow iteration that Amanda Seyfried wore in New York on Monday — made edgier by a pair of blackout shades and knee-high leather boots. Or the Dalmatian print Versace variant Millie Bobby Brown wore on Tuesday during her “Today” show appearance. The printed two piece was styled with a black beret that perched atop Brown’s freshly bleached locks. Tyla rounded off her vintage-style Chanel ensemble with a black mini bag and spiky cropped hair. While Gabrielle ‘Coco’ Chanel is most remembered for popularizing women’s trousers, it’s worth noting that her enduring contribution to the skirt suit is a close second.",,0.2802406847476959
"Lesotho’s foreign minister said on Wednesday he was shocked and insulted by US President Donald Trump saying nobody has heard of the African country, and invited him to come visit. Trump mentioned Lesotho in his address to US Congress on Tuesday evening while listing some of the foreign spending he had cut as “appalling waste.” “Eight million dollars to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of,” Trump said, drawing laughs in the Congress. Lesotho’s foreign minister, Lejone Mpotjoane, said the remark was “quite insulting.” “I’m really shocked that my country can be referred to like that by the head of state,” he told Reuters. Lesotho, a mountainous nation of about 2 million people which is encircled by South Africa, has the highest average altitude of any country and is sometimes called The Kingdom in the Sky.

      What it’s like to circumnavigate Lesotho on foot – in 16 days “Lesotho is such a significant and unique country in the whole world. I would be happy to invite the president, as well as the rest of the world to come to Lesotho,” said Mpotjoane. He said some civil society organizations funded by the US Embassy in Lesotho did work to support the LGBT+ community, but the United States also provided important funding for the country’s health and agriculture sectors. Trump’s administration has cut billions of dollars in foreign aid worldwide as it seeks to align spending with Trump’s “America First” policy. Mpotjoane said Lesotho was feeling the impact as the health sector had been reliant on that aid for some time, but that the government was looking at how to become more self-sufficient. “The decision by the president to cut the aid… it is (his) prerogative to do that,” said Mpotjoane. “We have to accept that. But to refer to my country like that, it is quite unfortunate.”",,0.27835559844970703
"Chinese hotpot giant Haidilao said it would compensate over 4,000 diners who had visited one of its outlets in Shanghai after two diners urinated into their hotpot broth. A video showing two men urinating into the broth of their hotpot while dining in a private room at a Haidilao restaurant started circulating online late last month. Haidilao said on Wednesday the incident occurred on February 24 but that it only became aware of the issue four days later and could not initially determine the time and location. It showed the case revealed a lack of training procedures, which led to staff’s failure to detect the situation promptly. The company confirmed the location in downtown Shanghai on March 6. “We fully understand that the distress caused to our customers by this incident cannot be fully compensated for by any means,” the company said in the statement. “We are willing to do our utmost to take responsibility.” The company did not say how much it would be spending in compensation. Haidilao reported the case to the police in Jianyang, Sichuan, where it is headquartered, and other locations. The police have since detained two men, both 17 years old, according to a statement issued by Shanghai police. Haidilao filed a civil lawsuit application against them on Monday, the company’s statement added.",,0.23879097402095795
"In her late 50s and early 60s, Li Dongju found herself solo traveling alongside people a third of her age. But despite her late start, she has now biked solo through 12 countries across three continents. The 66-year-old grandmother from Zhengzhou, in China’s central Henan province, has pedaled around Southeast Asia, Europe, and Oceania, visiting countries like Cambodia, France and Australia on her journeys. Speaking only Mandarin, she relied entirely on translation apps to communicate with locals. On a tight budget, she camped in parks, gas stations and even cemeteries, though she says many kind locals welcomed her into their homes. Li’s adventure was halted by the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2022. But she says that her cycling experiences have been﻿ “life changing.” Li believes that travel was what cured a decade-long depression that followed her divorce in 2005. “Before cycling, I was heavily dependent on others … and felt like a frog in a well,” she said. “Now, I’m a wild wolf — free, fearless and independent.” Related article
      China hopes new fleet of ‘silver trains’ will encourage its elderly to travel, and spend, more Becoming a ‘wild wolf’ Li first got interested in biking in 2013, when a group of fully geared cyclists whizzed past her. The group’s upbeat vibe sparked “a surge of envy” in Li, who says she was very depressed at the time. The retiree has been living on her pension — which is currently 3,000 yuan ($414) a month — since she was laid off from a state-owned textile factory in 2002. Short on cash, Li first bought herself just a bicycle helmet, but later her son gifted her a folding mountain bike, which costs about 1,000 yuan ($138). Although she dreamed of cycling to Tibet, the “roof of the world,” it felt impossible, as Li says she had only 170 yuan ($23.50) to her name. After a year of working as a house cleaner, she finally saved enough to join two seasoned cyclists she met online for a Southeast Asian adventure. However, the poorly equipped beginner — with only a basic mobile phone and the entry-level mountain bike — lost her travel companions after a week in Vietnam, finding herself alone in a strange land. Luckily, she met a Chinese-speaking local cyclist, who she said helped her return home. Despite her chaotic trip to Vietnam, Li was undeterred and decided to spend time biking around China to get more comfortable on two wheels. In 2015, she pedaled through 20 Chinese cities, from southeastern Hainan to far-western Xinjiang. Her brown poodle Xili (“razor sharp”) was her only travel companion, snuggling in the basket of Li’s bike. Sadly, Xili died in 2023, at the age of 11. Throughout the trip, Li was able to keep funding her travel by taking one-off gigs like cleaning in a spa and washing dishes in a high-end hotel. Two years later, the then-59-year-old was ready to revisit Southeast Asia — this time equipped with a smartphone loaded with translation and map apps, a comprehensive travel plan, and two elderly cycling pals she met online. Her two teammates were ready to call it quits and go home after about three weeks, but this time, Li opted to continue her journey solo, slowly biking through Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar. Li and her two cycling buddies are part of a growing group of “silver travelers” in China, where the population is aging at an alarming rate. According to Dai Bin, head of China Tourism Academy, who spoke to the state-run People’s Daily earlier this month, many Chinese seniors are choosing outbound travel nowadays, cruising to different destinations or combining travel with residency abroad. Spending about 70 days total in the four countries, Li came back home with thousands of memory-loaded photos — and confidence to explore farther afield. By 2019, Li was ready for another challenge. That spring, she set off to bike through six European countries. Over 66 days, she bumped into an octogenarian solo hiker in Croatia, chatted with bartenders via Google Translate in Bosnia and Herzegovina and followed local grannies in France to snag discount baguettes in supermarkets. In November, she flew to Australia. At that time, Australia was being ravaged by the worst wildfires the country had seen in decades. Burned forests and charred kangaroos frequently appeared along her way. As she pedaled along the Pacific Highway, a quiet coastal road, she spotted smoke rising from nearby brush and says she alerted the local police with a clip she shot, preventing a serious fire from developing. “I was so proud of myself.” Li told CNN. “I felt like I’d done a little bit for Australia.” Li went to New Zealand and then returned home in March 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic was spreading. At that point, Li realized she’d stopped taking her depression medication. Li believes that her adventures cured her depression. However, not everyone agrees that travel is a substitute for medication. Dr. Zhang Lixia, from a psychiatric hospital in Li’s hometown of Zhengzhou, notes that it’s crucial to follow doctors’ advice and make any treatment or medication changes under professional supervision. ‘Pass on kindness’ Still, Li’s travels had their challenges. In Australia, she lost her backpack containing all her cycling gear and supplies and had to start over. While crossing the border in Bosnia and Herzegovina, she thought that two armed border guards wanted high fives — but they were actually waving her down for an inspection. But Li says that she has had more positive experiences than negative ones. On a scorching day in Australia, a couple in an RV stopped to offer her a large bottle of ice-cold water, a hamburger, and some pomegranates. On another sweltering night, just as Li was about to set up her tent in a park, a couple — both avid cyclists who had visited China, according to Li — invited the older woman to stay at their home instead. “Every time I see her (photo), it brings tears to my eyes,” said Li, who brings Chinese knots that she can give as tokens of gratitude to all those who have helped her out during travel woes. It has been three years since Li’s journey was abruptly halted by the Covid pandemic. Now, the grandmother is “doing her homework” for a planned trip from Kazakhstan to the United Arab Emirates. “My goal is to visit at least 100 countries,” she told CNN. “Travel is like a drug. Once you taste it, you just can’t stop.”",,0.20732203125953674
"A United Airlines Boeing 787 jetliner flying from Los Angeles to Shanghai had to turn around last weekend after it was discovered one of the pilots had taken off without a passport, the airline told CNN in a statement. Flight UA 198 departed LAX at around 2 p.m. Saturday, March 22, with 257 passengers and 13 crew onboard and headed northwest over the Pacific Ocean, bound for China’s largest city. About two hours later, the plane turned around and was redirected to San Francisco, where it landed around 5 p.m. local time, according to the website FlightAware. “The pilot did not have their passport onboard,” United said in the statement. “We arranged for a new crew to take our customers to their destination that evening. Customers were provided with meal vouchers and compensation.” The flight with the new crew took off around 9 p.m. and landed in Shanghai about six hours behind schedule. Yang Shuhan, a Chinese passenger on board, told CNN that she heard the pilot’s “very frustrated voice” over the intercom, saying he “forgot (his) passport.” After landing in San Francisco, Yang received two meal vouchers totaling $30, which she used for a meal at a Japanese restaurant in the airport. She said she also filed a compensation claim on United’s website, where she was informed to expect a response within 14 business days. The traveler from Hangzhou, in eastern China, was on her way back from a business trip. After reaching Shanghai at 12:43 a.m. on Monday, she still had to drive another two and a half hours, she said, leaving her exhausted. While the unexpected delay threw a wrench in her Monday working plans, Yang said she appreciated the pilot’s “honesty.” However, many of her fellow passengers grumbled and said they were “outraged” and “speechless” on RedNote, China’s Instagram-like platform. “How could someone mess up this badly at work?” read a popular RedNote post appearing to be from another Chinese passenger on board. The post has gotten more than 10,000 likes. The disruptions didn’t stop with UA 198; passengers on the returning flight, UA 199 from Shanghai to Los Angeles, were also affected due to the late arrival of the inbound aircraft. A Shanghai-based business traveler, who requested to stay anonymous over privacy concerns, told CNN that their LA-bound flight was also delayed for about six hours, forcing them to change their ticket to catch a connecting flight. “I’m feeling pretty frustrated,” the person told CNN just after landing at LAX late Sunday night. “Because of the delay, I have to reschedule all my plans for Monday, which is really inconvenient.” ‘Lack of discipline’ “It’s quite embarrassing (for United),” Shukor Yusof, founder of Singapore-based Endau Analytics, an advisory firm that focuses on the aviation industry, told CNN. He added that the mistake is “unacceptable” for a global airline like United and it shows “a lack of discipline.” United is one of the world’s largest carriers, flying 140 million people to more than 300 destinations across six continents each year, according to the company’s website. Shukor noted that the “absent-mindedness” reflected in the incident could cost the airline dearly, taking into account the costs of things like the jet fuel they had to dump before diverting and compensation for the passengers.

      A passenger says a United pilot forcibly removed him from an airplane bathroom. Now he is suing While a series of plane crashes involving US carriers in recent months has raised security concerns, the latest incident with United is “more of a protocol issue,” said Shukor. Just last week, an Orthodox Jewish passenger filed a lawsuit against the airline, alleging a United pilot forcibly removed him from a lavatory while he was experiencing constipation, exposing his genitalia to others during a flight from Tulum, Mexico, to Houston. Meanwhile, a New Jersey mother blasted United for asking her to remove her “medically complex” son’s breathing tube ahead of the plane’s takeoff. Her TikTok video about the incident has garnered more than 1.3 million views.",,0.21104373037815094
"A Bangkok restaurant has reclaimed the number one spot at the annual Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants Awards. Gaggan, named the best restaurant in Asia in 2025, is known for its boundary-pushing fine-dining experience that serves progressive Indian cuisine with influences from around the world. It was the first time the eponymous restaurant by chef Gaggan Anand had snatched the top prize since he redefined his restaurant concept and moved to a new location in 2019 following wins in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. It ranked third on the list last year. “When we started as a restaurant, it was not about me but it was about Asia. Everyone in this room is a winner. Today, I’m taking the podium, but that doesn’t mean that one of us from Asia will not take it next time,” said Anand as he accepted the award during the ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday evening.

      ‘World’s best’ coffee shop for 2025 named “When I was young, I never imagined that Asia could be a gastronomic hub. And today, look who we are. We are not just one city, one country. We are a family of so many people from Asia, representing our culture, our family and our cuisine.” Two Chinese establishments in Hong Kong, The Chairman and Wing, took second and third spots, respectively. Both restaurants moved up two spots (from fourth and fifth) from last year’s awards. Vicky Cheng of Wing (no.3) also earned the peer-voted “Chefs’ Choice Award.” Last year’s winner Sezanne — a neo-French restaurant residing within the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo by English chef Daniel Calvert — came fourth this year. Mingles, which showcases contemporary Korean food with local ingredients and international techniques, rounded out the top five of this year’s Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants Awards. It was the top-rated restaurant in Korea and won a huge round of cheers from the hometown crowd. The list — part of the global “World’s 50 Best” brand — is compiled by the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, which is made up of more than 300 food critics, writers, chefs and restaurateurs, all selected for their knowledge of Asia’s restaurant scene. This year, Bangkok and Tokyo have the most entries on the top 50 list — both boasting nine restaurants in the rankings. Nusara, helmed by chef Thitid “Ton” Tassanakajohn, was another Bangkok restaurant that made it to the top 10 this year, ranking number six. Hong Kong and Singapore each had seven entries. Host city Seoul, like Shanghai, bagged four spots in the 2025 awards, including Eatanic Garden — a menuless fine-dining concept that highlights ingredients using five senses — at 25th place, which was the highest new entry on the list. For local chefs and foodies, hosting the event in Seoul for the second year in a row was a sign that Korean food has truly earned a place of global influence. “Because (this) event has happened in Korea, I was able to participate and interact with many chefs,” Kim Jae-ho, chef at the Andaz Seoul Gangnam, told CNN Travel at the event. “Korean culture is becoming popular abroad. I will work to become a chef who can play a role in further spreading Korean dining culture to overseas.” It’s also the second year Bangkok brought home the award for “Asia’s Best Female Chef.” Chudaree ‘Tam’ Debhakam, this year’s awardee, is known for her farm-driven cuisine highlighting the beauty of Thai produce. Her restaurant Baan Tepa was named 44th on the list this year. Last year’s winner, Pichaya ‘Pam’ Soontornyanakij, and her Thai-Chinese restaurant Potong secured 13th place this year. Chef Tam’s Seasons in Macao, which came ninth, was the winner of this year’s “Highest Climber Award,” dramatically ascending 40 spots from 49th in 2024. Kazutaka Ozawa from Crony (no.30) in Tokyo was recognized as the best sommelier in the region. Related article

"Move over, Golden Gate and Sydney Harbour. China is set to open the world’s tallest bridge in June, the latest feat of engineering from the infrastructure-focused country. The Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge is currently nearing the end of construction in Guizhou, southwest China. It will measure 2,051 feet above river level, which is 947 feet taller than current bridge title holder the Millau Viaduct in France. Guizhou province is a mountainous areas of China, with complex terrain. The bridge crosses the dramatic Huajiang Grand Canyon, also called the “earth crack.” China has a nationwide push to improve infrastructure, especially in relatively underdeveloped mountainous areas like Guizhou, which is 800 miles west of the city of Shenzhen. Thus, the bridge isn’t just about breaking a record — once in operation, it will be easier than ever for cars and trucks to traverse the area. According to state media, it will reduce travel time over the Huajiang Grand Canyon from two hours to just one minute. The bridge is a steel truss suspension bridge with a total length of 9,482 feet. Construction officially started on January 18, 2022 and is expected to be completed on June 30, 2025, Guizhou local state media said. Altogether, these trusses weigh about 22,000 tons, equivalent to three Eiffel Towers. “At present, the overall progress of the bridge has reached 95%, and it is planned to be opened to traffic in the second half of 2025,” Zhang Shenglin, chief engineer of Guizhou Highway Group, told the state-run newspaper China Daily. “By then, this super project that spans the “earth crack” will be the world’s first in both directions. It will become another landmark project to demonstrate China’s infrastructure strength,” Zhang added. Currently, nearly half of the top 100 tallest bridges in the world are in Guizhou.

"Bianca Tse is among a growing number of artists embracing AI. “It’s shortened the path between my ideas and my visions,” said the 43-year-old, sitting in front of “Breathing Room,” a photo recently showcased at the Blue Lotus Gallery in Hong Kong. In it, three Chinese men appear to sit comfortably, albeit precariously, on stools atop a narrow tower of derelict flats. This photograph could not exist in real life, she said, but it captures the feel of the city’s cramped living conditions, and a distinct Hong Kong “flavor.” Tse’s work is part fantasy — generated from AI — and part historical reference, drawing from her own childhood memories and the history of Hong Kong’s working class. Many of her images are set in an AI-exaggerated version of the Kowloon Walled City — a former Qing dynasty fortress that became the most densely populated place on Earth. Refugees fleeing from mainland China during the Chinese civil war, flooded into then-British ruled Hong Kong and had made the enclave their home. It was demolished in the 1990s but still looms large in the memories of Hong Kong residents. While she never visited the Walled City, Tse has been fascinated by its history, and sees it as representative of a Hong Kong that is culturally and architecturally disappearing amid ongoing development and gentrification. Through interviews and rare, personal photographs, Tse has been able to expand on some former residents’ memories in a new way. She has recreated scenes inspired by their lives in the form of short AI-generated videos and pictures. The role of AI in art The use of artificial intelligence to create art has become increasingly controversial, with artists expressing concern that their work can be used to train AI models without compensation. While Tse agrees, she said AI tools like Midjourney have also allowed her to make works that would be otherwise impossible. Related article
      The artist making unsettling AI images of the human body “I don’t need to hire actors, I don’t need to set up all the scenes, and, yeah, it saves a lot of time, and mainly money, because nobody is going to invest in me to create all of these (pieces),” she said. The technology has opened up a new world for Tse, a freelance advertising creative director, who has been posting her AI experiments on Instagram. The French gallery La Grande Vitrine included her early work in the Rencontres d’Arles exhibition “A State of Consciousness” in France in 2023. And more recently, she’s shown alongside photographers Greg Girard and Ian Lambot — two photographers who famously documented the Kowloon Walled City — as part of Blue Lotus Gallery’s “Voices of The Walls,” exhibition about the informal settlement, where an estimated 33,000 people lived within the space of one city block. Related article
      What this playful photo reveals about Hong Kong’s infamous ‘Walled City’ Tse’s sense of surrealism is grounded in reality. In her broader depictions of Hong Kong, she focuses on details such as the particular way the paint peels, the concrete walls stain and corrugated metal roofing rusts. These textures might not typically get noticed, and can be overshadowed in the dystopic, cyberpunk depictions of the city found in video games such as “Stray” and movies like “Batman Begins.” The people in her images also feel familiar. They include muscular bamboo-scaffolding builders, a woman in a quintessential Hong Kong barbershop with a mountain of metal rollers in her hair, and the aforementioned men in wrinkled shirts sitting hunched on thin-legged stools. One recurring theme Tse explores is how chaos and poverty exists right alongside happiness and hope. “Imaginary Friends” shows a little girl in a market surrounded by trash bags transformed into stuffed animals, and is actually based on her own childhood memories of waiting for her mother in the rain outside the frozen meat shop where she worked. “I was living in temporary housing — a metal sheet temporary home with two floors, in Fanling, with two bunk beds. I think (it was) under 100 square feet,” she recalled. “I only realized I was poor when I grew up,” she added. “I had a really happy childhood, maybe because of the lack of parental guidance. Because my parents both went to work, I just go about freely, especially after school.” An untaken photo By working with generative AI software, Tse has learned not to fear human artists becoming obsolete. “I think if everyone tried to use AI, they’d know that the role of the artist or designer cannot be replaced,” she said. Prompting with a single word might be easy, she explained, but “if you really want to create something close to your vision or something meaningful, it is actually very hard.” To illustrate her point, Tse pulls up a string of images of failed prompts she created in Midjourney: a contact sheet of Asian men, women and children with a pile of noodles for hair, comically positioned and that look more like a slapdash Photoshop job than the surreal, polished works of art in her portfolio. To lessen the uncanny valley effect — the eerie sensation people feel when faced with something artificial but nearly human — Tse does a great deal of post-production work. “I don’t like generating perfect-looking humans. I like someone who looks more like daily life,” Tse said. This was one of the challenges she faced when she collaborated with Girard, on creating a “photo that got away.” In the late 1980s, Girard, who had been photographing the Kowloon Walled City,  had seen a Cathay Pacific flight attendant get out of a cab and walk into the City, pulling her luggage behind her. Her elegance and poise were a stark contrast to the gritty surroundings, but he lost her in the maze of alleys before he was able to take a shot. Though he waited around, hoping to see her again, he never did. “I didn’t get it, and I thought (the image) was gone forever,” he said. But with the photographer’s blessing, Tse fed his photographs and a series of prompts into Midjourney, going through several thousand versions, she said, to make the woman and the photograph look real. Girard said he was interested to collaborate because Tse’s work is “such a departure” from his own. “I was curious where she would take it. “What won me over was that she (Tse) asked, straight up, for permission,” he added in a phone interview. “Because so many people just steal it and you discover it later and then go about trying to deal with that. She was very correct and straight out.” The outcome was “very close” to the way Girard remembers it. “It felt somehow both a little disorienting but also satisfying, to have someone else make a picture of what was going on inside your own head.”",,0.2979775667190552
"Editor’s Note: A version of this article was first published on February 10, 2024. In photographer Zhang Xiao’s images of the Shehuo festival, an ancient celebration still observed in parts of northern China during the Lunar New Year, rural life comes alive with something altogether more fantastical. Villagers dressed as cranes, roosters and mythical lions pose for portraits standing amid crops or in fallow farmland. Costumed performers parade past brick houses against hazy backdrops, the eyes of their masks seemingly lost in thought. In a harvested wheat field, a group of almost a dozen men line up to hold aloft a colorful dragon puppet. In his book “Community Fire,” Zhang said he wanted to capture the surreal “disconnect” between people’s everyday lives and the mythical personas they assumed. “Their characters seemed to come from the sky itself, and … formed a huge theatrical stage that transcended the confines of reality, transporting a collective of sleepwalkers to a dreamworld,” he wrote. “I wandered among them and photographed them quietly, because I did not want to wake them up.” Rooted in millennia-old agricultural practices of worshipping fire and the land, the folk rituals of Shehuo (often translated as “earth and fire”) traditionally entailed praying for good fortune and bounteous harvests, or to drive away demons. Festivities vary between regions but now typically see various performers, from stilt walkers to opera singers, parading through the streets or staging shows. Related article
      What this playful photo reveals about Hong Kong’s infamous ‘Walled City’ Today, celebrations coincide with the Lunar New Year, which starts Wednesday. As such, they have come to encompass many of the traditions — such as temple fairs and lion dances — practiced around China during this period. (Lunar New Year celebrations usually last more than two weeks, with Shehuo festival taking place on the season’s 15th and final day.) Shehuo celebrations have been recognized by the Chinese government in its UNESCO-style list of “intangible cultural heritage.” But the festival’s place in a rapidly urbanizing country remains under threat, said Zhang, adding that most of the performers he encountered had migrated to cities and only returned to their villages for the holiday. “The significance of traditional customs can no longer meet the needs of modern lives,” the photographer told CNN via email. “Today’s young people are more concerned about the internet and games. They are not even willing to try and understand traditional cultures. I think that’s sad.” E-commerce and the death of craft Hoping to document the festival’s disappearing traditions — and the costumes and props associated with them — Zhang spent over a decade photographing Shehuo events at villages in Shaanxi and Henan provinces. A selection of the images, which were shot between 2007 and 2019, also went on show in the US at Harvard University’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology (and over 100 of them were published in “Community Fire”). As well as capturing rites, rituals and folklore, the photos speak to the proliferation of mass-produced paraphernalia that has transformed the festival since the turn of the 21st century. One image depicts a stack of expressionless plastic masks; a set of 12 eerie pictures shows smiling prop heads hanging from trees in flimsy carrier bags. Several pages of Zhang’s book are dedicated to screengrabs of Alibaba-owned shopping platform, Taobao, where Shehuo items can be purchased at bargain prices. They range from an elaborate two-person lion dance costume, offered for just 360 yuan ($50), to a selection of headdresses priced under 17 yuan ($2.40). The rise of cheap goods and e-commerce has been a mixed blessing for these villages. Some of them — including Huozhuang, in Henan province, which features heavily in Zhang’s project — have taken advantage of the opportunity. The photographer visited and documented several small family workshops that buy semi-complete products in large quantities online before hand-finishing them and selling them on platforms like Taobao for profit. “In some villages, virtually the entire population has been mobilized to produce and sell Shehuo props,” the photographer writes in his book. But with economic opportunity comes a loss of traditional skills and customs. Materials like paper and bamboo have been replaced by cheap wire frames, plastic and synthetic fabrics, said Zhang, who grew up in a rural area of China’s Shandong province but is now based in Chengdu, one of the country’s largest metropolises in the southwest. A third-generation prop maker told Zhang that, in the photographer’s words, that he “lamented the gradual disappearance of traditional crafts.” But most of the villagers the photographer encountered were indifferent to the loss of cultural heritage, he claimed.

      Photo of a man posing with a Coca-Cola bottle in 1981 symbolized a cultural shift in China And while Zhang, as a documentarian, assumed the role of a “quiet spectator” while on assignment, he nonetheless expressed regret at the festival’s rapid commercialization. “People are not focused on how to improve product quality and craftsmanship,” said the photographer, who is currently working on a documentary about life in rural China. “Instead, they are obsessed with how to manufacture these products as quickly as possible, and at the lowest cost, so as to gain an advantage against the competition. This has led to a gradual decline in product quality, and the entire industry has fallen into a vicious cycle of price wars.” “Community Fire,” published by Aperture and Peabody Museum Press, is available now.",,0.31620660424232483
"Perched atop several flights of concrete stairs, Blue Lotus Gallery is nestled beside hipster coffee shops and vintage stores in the narrow, tree-lined lanes of Hong Kong’s artsy Sheung Wan district. It’s also surrounded by basketball courts: in parks, balanced on rooftops and invisibly sequestered between skyscrapers. All in all, there are 22 courts within a 600-meter (1,968-foot) radius of the gallery. Its proximity to so many basketball courts is, oddly, not an anomaly in Hong Kong. American photographer Austin Bell estimates that the city has more outdoor courts than even New York or Los Angeles, after scouring satellite images and as part of his mission to photograph every one of them in Hong Kong. It’s the subject of his exhibition at the gallery, running until February 23, and his photobook, “Shooting Hoops.” Using his camera and drone, Bell took over 58,000 photos of 2,549 colorful basketball courts; a project spread across three years due to the coronavirus pandemic. The project was a way to “experience the city” and examine its often unconventional approach to urban design, said Bell. “It’s not really about the sport — it’s more just about the architecture, the color, the surroundings and the topography of Hong Kong,” he added. 100 courts a day Bell’s fascination with Hong Kong’s basketball courts began with his first trip to the city in 2017, when he visited the colorful Choi Hung, a rainbow-colored public housing project with multiple basketball courts in front of its tower blocks, vividly painted marigold yellow, royal blue and emerald green. It’s become one of the city’s “Instagram hotspots,” attracting photographers like Bell to capture its facade. After taking the photo, he didn’t think much of it — until he started seeing basketball courts in other unusual and colorful locations. “I started mapping them on Google Maps,” Bell said. “I came back in the fall of 2019 to shoot them, and after two weeks, I said, I need to try and find all of them.” Poring over satellite images, Bell identified basketball courts hidden among housing blocks, perched on mall rooftops and multi-story parking lots, or shrouded in thick jungle on remote islands, tracking them obsessively in spreadsheets. When he began the project in earnest, Bell said he photographed up to 100 courts on some days — a number that he said “isn’t that crazy” when considering the density of Hong Kong, which ranks fourth internationally with 7,060 people per square kilometer, according to 2021 data from the World Bank. On one occasion, he challenged himself to shoot as many courts as possible in a single day, planning a route through many of the city’s most populous residential neighborhoods, like Tuen Mun, Tin Shui Wai and Yuen Long. “I was just going out to take one diagnostic picture of each court and see how many I could do,” said Bell. The main limitation was the drone batteries, and he anticipated shooting around 200 — but surprised himself once he got home and counted 475. Not all of the courts were that accessible: some required a full day of traveling, like the remote island of Ap Chau, Hong Kong’s smallest inhabited island that was settled in 1952 by Christian missionaries from Beijing. People are often absent from Bell’s photos. In part, it’s because he visited the courts in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the harsh noon sun, but on the other hand, Bell did not want to disturb people on the court. Over the years, Bell has observed a multitude of uses for the basketball courts, beyond their intended purpose. “I’ve seen choral practices, people walking their pet tortoises, people drying orange peels, everything you could imagine,” he said. “Its main purpose is basketball, and you’ve got big signs saying, no other ball games, no hanging laundry, no remote-control cars or whatever — but you still see all that stuff.” “It’s so many different things all the time, I think that’s what makes it compelling. But it’s also just the fact that, there’s just not that many other (public) spaces to do things.” Playful planning policies Basketball — a game invented in the US in 1891 as a safe but entertaining non-contact sport for the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) — has been a perennial favorite in Hong Kong for more than a century. Jeroen van Ameijde, an assistant professor of urban design at The Chinese University of Hong Kong who contributed an essay on the topic to Bell’s photobook, speculated that the arrival of the YMCA in the city in 1901, followed by the construction of the organization’s (at the time) cutting-edge sports facilities, was likely what sparked Hong Kong’s basketball craze. As the city’s population expanded rapidly in the 1950s and ‘60s, recreational space was a key consideration for city planners. This was later codified in guidelines for new public housing projects, stipulating the need for one outdoor basketball court per 10,000 residents — a higher ratio than any other outdoor sports facility. “It is much smaller than a football (soccer) pitch, it’s relatively easy to maintain, and in some cases, can be used for dual use,” Van Ameijde told CNN in a phone interview. While incorporating leisure facilities into urban design is common, Hong Kong’s population-based guidelines are unusual, said Van Ameijde. It’s symptomatic of the city’s high density and scarce land, where maximizing efficiency is vital: for example, the proximity of recreational facilities to residents aims to make housing projects and districts “self-contained,” like a 15-minute city where everything is within walking distance, explained Van Ameijde. This culture of space efficiency has evolved in recent years into the “beautifying” of some of these leisure spaces, said Van Ameijde, pointing to the work of cross-disciplinary design firm One Bite Design, which has upgraded several rooftop and mall basketball courts with vivid designs. “The basketball courts always find a way to puzzle into the urban fabric, whether it’s in between buildings, or on rooftops of shopping malls,” said Van Ameijde. “It’s an interesting balance, this sort of hyper-dense mix of both life and work, commerce and efficiency, which is very much in the DNA of Hong Kong.” Making the mundane magical Hong Kong’s public basketball courts are just a fraction of the story though, accounting for less than a third of the ones Bell snapped. The majority of Bell’s photos, around 1,800, are of school basketball courts that he captured using a drone. Accessibility is one of the biggest differences Bell has observed between the basketball courts in Hong Kong and New York — the latter of which he believes has the world’s second-highest number of outdoor courts, and where he’s shot around 1,000 courts so far and has mapped 1,000 more. “You would never know it’s there unless you were up in a building somewhere looking down on it,” said Bell said of Hong Kong’s school basketball courts. “So I think that was part of the appeal too — I wanted to conquer these walls through the aerial dimension, and get everything that’s hiding behind them.” Almost all of these images were shot with a drone — something he adds is now not possible, since the tightening of drone laws in Hong Kong in late 2022. It’s one of the reasons why, even as Bell continues to monitor and track the locations of new courts, he doesn’t think he’ll revisit the project in the future. “The number has already changed. There are already new ones since I finished this project — new housing (projects) have been built, there’s probably some that have been torn down. The number is constantly fluctuating,” he said. But the exhibition, and the book, is about more than documenting a niche topic: for Bell, his mission to find and photograph every court was an exercise in making the mundane magical. “We take all these visual things, like basketball courts, for granted,” he said, adding that when, “in reality, when you condense them together in a picture, or put them in 2D, you can see it’s really something different.”",,0.3692483901977539
"Editor’s Note: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being. Guinness, like other Irish stouts, enjoys a seasonal popularity every St. Patrick’s Day. It has also been touted as being “good for you,” at least by its own advertising posters decades ago. But can this creamy, rich and filling beer really be added to a list of healthy beverages? Or is its reputation just good marketing? We researched the beer’s history and talked to brewing experts and break out the good, the not-so-great and the ingenuity of Guinness. The good about Guinness The original Guinness is a type of ale known as stout. It’s made from a grist (grain) that includes a large amount of roasted barley, which gives it its intense burnt flavor and very dark color. And though you wouldn’t rank it as healthful as a vegetable, the stouts in general, as well as other beers, may be justified in at least some of their nutritional bragging rights. According to Charlie Bamforth, distinguished professor emeritus of brewing sciences at the University of California, Davis, most beers contain significant amounts of antioxidants, B vitamins, the mineral silicon (which may help protect against osteoporosis), soluble fiber and prebiotics, which promote the growth of “good” bacteria in your gut. And Guinness may have a slight edge compared with other brews, even over other stouts. “We showed that Guinness contained the most folate of the imported beers we analyzed,” Bamforth said. Folate is a B vitamin that our bodies need to make DNA and other genetic material. It’s also necessary for cells to divide.  According to his research, stouts on average contain 12.8 micrograms of folate, or 3.2% of the recommended daily allowance. Related article
      Alcohol and your heart: Just getting a buzz can trigger an irregular rhythm Because Guinness contains a lot of unmalted barley, which contains more fiber than malted grain, it is also one of the beers with the highest levels of fiber, according to Bamforth. (Note: Though the US Department of Agriculture lists beer as containing zero grams of fiber, Bamforth said his research shows otherwise.) Bamforth has researched and coauthored studies published in the Journal of the Institute of Brewing and the Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists. Here’s more potentially good news about Guinness: Despite its rich flavor and creamy consistency, it’s not the highest in calories compared with other beers. A 12-ounce serving of Guinness Draught has 125 calories. By comparison, the same size serving of Budweiser has 145 calories, Heineken has 142 calories, and Samuel Adams Cream Stout has 189 calories. In the United States, Guinness Extra Stout, by the way, has 149 calories. This makes sense when you consider that alcohol is the main source of calories in beers. Guinness Draught has a lower alcohol content, at 4.2% alcohol by volume, compared with 5% for Budweiser and Heineken, and 4.9% for the Samuel Adams Cream Stout. In general, moderate alcohol consumption – defined by the USDA’s dietary guidelines for Americans as no more than two drinks per day for men or one drink per day for women – may protect against heart disease. So you can check off another box. The not-so-great Guinness is still alcohol, and consuming too much can impair judgment and contribute to weight gain. Heavy drinking (considered more than 14 drinks a week for men or more than seven drinks a week for women) and binge drinking (five or more drinks for men, and four or more for women, in about a two-hour period) are also associated with many health problems, including liver disease, pancreatitis and high blood pressure. According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, “alcohol is the most commonly used addictive substance in the United States: 17.6 million people, or one in every 12 adults, suffer from alcohol abuse or dependence along with several million more who engage in risky, binge drinking patterns that could lead to alcohol problems.” Related article
      Your boozy nightcap is disrupting your sleep. Try these tips instead And while moderate consumption of alcohol may have heart benefits for some, consumption of alcohol can also increase a woman’s risk of breast cancer for each drink consumed daily. Many decades ago, in Ireland, it would not have been uncommon for a doctor to advise pregnant and nursing women to drink Guinness. But today, experts (particularly in the United States) caution of the dangers associated with consuming any alcohol while pregnant. “Alcohol is a teratogen, which is something that causes birth defects. It can cause damage to the fetal brain and other organ systems,” said Dr. Erin Tracy, an OB/GYN at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive gynecology. “We don’t know of any safe dose of alcohol in pregnancy. Hence we recommend abstaining entirely during this brief period of time in a woman’s life.” Related article
      Is drinking alcohol bad for your health? New dietary guidelines will weigh risks and benefits What about beer for breastfeeding? “In Britain, they have it in the culture that drinking Guinness is good for nursing mothers,” said Karl Siebert, professor emeritus of the food science department and previous director of the brewing program at Cornell University. Beer in general has been regarded as a galactagogue, or stimulant of lactation, for much of history. In fact, according to irishtimes.com, breastfeeding women in Ireland were once given a bottle of Guinness a day in maternity hospitals. According to Domhnall Marnell, the Guinness ambassador, Guinness Original (also known as Guinness Extra Stout, depending on where it was sold) debuted in 1821, and for a time, it contained live yeast, which had a high iron content, so it was given to anemic individuals or nursing mothers then, before the effects of alcohol were fully understood. Some studies have showed evidence that ingredients in beer can increase prolactin, a hormone necessary for milk production; others have showed the opposite. Regardless of the conclusions, the alcohol in beer also appears to counter the benefits associated with increased prolactin secretion. “The problem is that alcohol temporarily inhibits the milk ejection reflex and overall milk supply, especially when ingested in large amounts, and chronic alcohol use lowers milk supply permanently,” said Diana West, coauthor of “The Breastfeeding Mother’s Guide to Making More Milk.” Related article
      Young Americans more likely to say no to alcohol, study finds “Barley can be eaten directly, or even made from commercial barley drinks, which would be less problematic than drinking beer,” West said. If you’re still not convinced that beer is detrimental to breastfeeding, consider this fact: A nursing mother drinking any type of alcohol puts her baby in potential danger. “The fetal brain is still developing after birth – and since alcohol passes into breast milk, the baby is still at risk,” Tracy said. “This is something we would not advocate today,” Marnell agreed. “We would not recommend to anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding to be enjoying our products during this time in their life.” Regarding the old wives’ tale about beer’s effects on breastfeeding, Marnell added, “It’s not something that Guinness has perpetuated … and if (people are still saying it), I’d like to say once and for all, it’s not something we support or recommend.” The ingenuity Assuming you are healthy and have the green light to drink beer, you might wonder why Guinness feels like you’ve consumed a meal, despite its lower calorie and alcohol content. It has to do with the sophistication that goes into producing and pouring Guinness. According to Bamforth, for more than half a century, Guinness has put nitrogen gas into its beer at the packaging stage, which gives smaller, more stable bubbles and delivers a more luscious mouthfeel. It also tempers the harsh burnt character coming from the roasted barley. Guinness cans, containing a widget to control the pour, also have some nitrogen. Guinness is also dispensed through a special tap that uses a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. “In Ireland, Guinness had a long history of hiring the best and brightest university graduates regardless of what they were trained in,” Siebert said. “And they put them to work on things they needed. One was a special tap for dispensing Guinness, which has 11 different nozzles in it, that helps to form the fine-bubbled foam.” The foam is remarkably long-lasting. “After you get a freshly poured Guinness, you can make a face in the foam, and by the time you finish drinking it, the face is still there,” Siebert said. ‘It’s a good day for a Guinness,’ unless you’re pregnant The famous advertising Guinness slogans – including “It’s a good day for a Guinness” – started through word of mouth, said Marnell. “In 1929, when we were about to do our first ad, we asked (ourselves), ‘What stance should we take?’ So we sent around a group of marketers (in Ireland and the UK) to ask Guinness drinkers why they chose Guinness, and nine out of 10 said their belief was that the beer was healthy for them. We already had this reputation in the bars before we uttered a word about the beer. Related article
      The more alcohol ads kids see, the more alcohol they consume “That led to the Gilroy ads that were posted,” Marnell explained, referring to the artist John Gilroy, responsible for the Guinness ads from 1928 to the 1960s. “You’ll see the characters representing the Guinness brand – the toucan, the pelican – and slogans like ‘Guinness is good for you’ or ‘Guinness for Strength.’ But those were from the 1920s, ’30s and ‘40s.” Today, he said, the company would not claim any health benefits for its beer. “If anyone is under the impression that there are health benefits to drinking Guinness, then unfortunately, I’m the bearer of bad news. Guinness is not going to build muscle or cure you of influenza.” In fact, Guinness’ parent company, Diageo, spends a lot of effort supporting responsible drinking initiatives and educating consumers about alcohol’s effects. Its DrinkIQ page offers information such as calories in alcohol, how your body processes it and when alcohol can be dangerous, including during pregnancy. “One of the main things we focus on … is that while we would love people to enjoy our beer, we want to make sure they do so as responsibly as possible,” Marnell said. “We would never recommend that anyone drink to excess, and (we want to make people) aware of how alcohol effects the body.” And again: Most health providers in the US would advise forgoing all alcohol if you are pregnant, nursing or have other health or medical issues where alcohol consumption is not advised. So responsibly celebrate St. Patrick this year a little wiser about the health benefits and risks with one of its signature potables. This story originally published in 2017.

"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life. Just as spring is a time for rebirth, the Persian New Year is a time to celebrate new life. Nowruz is celebrated on the spring equinox, which this year is on Thursday, March 20. This celebration of spring is filled with symbolism around rebirth and renewal, because spring is a time when life is coming back after a long, cold winter, said Yasmin Khan,  the London-based human rights campaigner turned author of “The Saffron Tales: Recipes from the Persian Kitchen,” “Zaitoun: Recipes and Stories from the Palestinian Kitchen,” and “Ripe Figs: Recipes and Stories from the Eastern Mediterranean.” These three cookbooks from Khan inspire and provide a window into the cultures and stories of people from the Middle East through food. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What are some of Persian New Year’s traditions and rituals? Yasmin Khan: On the last Tuesday before the New Year, there is a tradition to make small bonfires in your garden. Traditionally people jump over the bonfires, and it’s supposed to be a symbol of purification, challenges of the year gone by, and energetically cleansing you and preparing you for the year ahead. A key tradition is to set up an altar in your house called a Haft-seen, which means seven S’s in Farsi. You place seven things on your altar that begin with the letter S in Farsi, which are symbols or qualities you’d like to invite in for the year ahead. You can have apples for good health, candles for light, eggs for fertility, wheatgrass for rebirth and renewal, vinegar for wisdom, and a gold coin for abundance and prosperity. Each person chooses items that have meaning for them. The festival lasts two weeks. At the end of the festival, you take the wheatgrass you’ve been growing on your altar and you take it down to some running water somewhere. You tie knots in the wheatgrass then throw it into the running water. It would float off along with all your hopes and dreams for the year ahead. Related article
      A Ramadan etiquette guide for non-Muslims CNN: What food is important for the holiday? Khan: Like all cultural celebrations, food is a really integral part. Because it’s a festival celebrating spring, we eat lots of green and fresh herbs. For example, there’s this dish called Kuku Sabzi (see recipe below), which is a gorgeous herb and spinach frittata that we always eat on the first day of the year in our house. The frittata is fragrant and aromatic and is served with flatbreads, sliced tomatoes and pickles. The first meal of the Persian New Year is always fish served with herb-flecked rice filled with dill, parsley and chives in it. The two-week festival is a time of celebration with people you know … traditionally you go to people’s houses and eat lots of delicious sweets and pastries. CNN: What are some easy ways people can join in the celebrations? Khan: Cooking is probably the easiest and most fun way to celebrate the new year. I really recommend that people give some Persian recipes a go. As well as being delicious, they’re healthy and vibrant with all the herbs that are packed in them. In the weeks before the new year, we do a big deep spring cleaning called “shaking down the house” in Farsi. It’s really lovely to have a focus and have something that is about bringing in new life, renewal and rebirth during this difficult time. Related article
      Why you keep having recurring dreams and what it means And no one regrets a spring clean, so I think that’s also a really great idea. I think this is a beautiful kind of nonreligious festival that everyone can join into and that we can all relate to. It’s a time where we really try and let go of any difficulties that we’ve had in the past year and try to start the new year with a clean slate. Recipes for the Persian New Year Kuku Sabzi - Persian Mixed Herb Frittata This Iranian frittata is a sensational deep green color and tastes like spring on a plate, bursting with fresh herby flavor. It is incredibly quick to throw together, will keep for a few days in the fridge, and can be enjoyed hot or cold. Serve as an appetizer or as part of a mezze spread, wrapped up in a flatbread with some slices of tomato and a few salty and sour fermented cucumber pickles, or add some crumbled feta and lightly toasted walnuts for a more substantial main. Makes 4 servings as a main or 8 servings as a starter Prep time: 15 minutes | Total time: 35 minutes Ingredients 7 ounces|200 grams spinach 1 3/4 ounces|50 grams fresh parsley 1 3/4 ounces|50 grams fresh dill 2 2/3 ounces|75 grams fresh cilantro 5 medium eggs 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon dried fenugreek leaf 2 teaspoons sunflower oil 2 garlic cloves, crushed Instructions 1. Wash spinach, parsley, dill and cilantro, then dry well on paper towels or in a salad spinner. Squeeze out as much moisture as possible; if the greens are wet when they are cooked, they will make the kuku go spongy. Chop finely or blitz in a food processor, in a couple of batches. 2. Heat broiler to high. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl. Add turmeric, flour, salt, pepper and fenugreek leaf. Stir in the chopped spinach and herbs. 3. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet. Add garlic and gently fry over low heat to soften, about 2 minutes. 4. Make sure garlic is evenly distributed around the skillet, then pour in the egg mixture. Cook over low heat until kuku is almost cooked through, 5-8 minutes. Finish off in hot broiler. 5. Let kuku cool slightly, then cut into triangular slices to serve. Sabzi Polo Baa Mahi - Mixed Herb Rice With Baked Salmon Makes 4 servings Ingredients Marinade 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 cup dark soy sauce Juice of 1 medium lemon 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional) 4 salmon fillets Mixed herb rice 1 3/4 cups white basmati rice Sea salt Pinch of saffron strands Pinch of granulated sugar 2 tablespoons freshly boiled water 1 small bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped 1 small bunch fresh coriander, finely chopped 2 tablespoons fresh dill, finely chopped 2 tablespoons bunch fresh chives, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed Sunflower oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided Instructions 1. To make the marinade, combine garlic, soy sauce, lemon juice, olive oil and cayenne pepper, if using, in a deep bowl. Add salmon, turn to coat well, cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. 2. Rinse and parboil rice and prepare the saffron liquid. Place saffron in a pestle and mortar with sugar and grind until you have a fine powder. Add just-boiled water and let steep for 10 minutes. 3. Very carefully, fold rice, chopped herbs, garlic clove and 1 tablespoon oil together, being careful not to break the rice grains. 4. Preheat oven to 400°F/Gas 6. Place an 8”-wide nonstick saucepan with snug-fitting lid over a medium heat. Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 2 tablespoons oil. Add 1 tablespoon saffron liquid and season with a pinch of salt. Once the fat is hot, sprinkle a thin layer of rice over the bottom and firmly press down to line the base of the pan. Using a large spoon, gently layer the rest of the rice on top, building it up into a pyramid shape. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, make 4 holes in the rice. Dot remaining 1 tablespoon butter into holes and then pour over the rest of the saffron liquid. 5. Place a clean tea towel or 4 paper towels on top of the pan and fit the lid on tightly. Tuck in the edges of the tea towel, or trim paper towels to fit, so they won’t catch the flame. Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to very low and cook 15 minutes more. Take rice off heat and let sit. Do not be tempted to sneak a peek while it is cooking as this will disturb the steaming process. When rice has been cooking for 10 minutes, place salmon on a baking tray and bake skin side up until cooked to your liking, 10-15 minutes. 6. Once rice has cooked, fill sink with 2” cold water and place saucepan – with lid still tightly on – in the water. This will produce a rush of steam that should loosen the base of the rice. Remove lid, place a large plate on top of pan and quickly turn rice over. Present the herbed rice with the fish and serve immediately.

"Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life. The battle over the health merits of various cooking fats has never really gotten below a simmer — but it’s starting to heat up again. Beef tallow and other animal fats, including pig lard and butter, were traditionally used as the main cooking fats in the United States up until the early 20th century. A shift occurred in the early to mid-20th century, when scientists started looking into the consumption of animal fat as the culprit behind the uptick of cardiovascular issues. Vegetable and seed oils that had largely been used for industrial purposes — such as soaps, machinery fuel and candles — started to be widely promoted as heart-healthy alternatives to animal fats. And indeed, research has shown that plant-based oils, such as olive and canola oil, may be better for certain health outcomes than animal-based fats, like butter. Related article
      RFK Jr. wants to eliminate FDA’s controversial food additive program. Here’s why that matters Now US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he’s on a crusade to “make America healthy,” and seed oils are among his targets. Kennedy’s campaign website still sells hats embroidered with the phrase “make frying oil tallow again.” “Seed oil is one of the components of processed foods, and all the science indicates that ultraprocessed foods are the principal culprit in this extraordinary explosion, the epidemic we have of chronic disease,” Kennedy said in a recent interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity at a Steak ’n Shake in Florida. Kennedy said he wants to “incentivize” companies to switch to “traditional ingredients like beef tallow,” after Steak ’n Shake had announced in January it would fry its fries in beef tallow. After the Hannity interview, Steak ’n Shake clarified that its suppliers are still currently par-frying its fries, onion rings and chicken tenders with vegetable oil prior to shipping them to restaurants. While seed oil is found in ultraprocessed foods, and there are studies linking ultraprocessed foods to many health conditions, there are also studies linking the consumption of animal fats to adverse health outcomes. Decades of research have produced a “wealth of data” showing that diets higher in plant fats result in better health outcomes than diets higher in animal fats, said Dr. Alice H. Lichtenstein, the Stanley N. Gershoff Professor of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University in Boston. “I think it would be detrimental to increase our intake of animal fat and decrease our intake of plant oils,” Lichtenstein said. “I would say that (beef tallow) is less healthy because it’s higher in saturated fat, and I don’t see any advantage.” But the debate, which often plays out on social media, is complicated. Not all vegetable oils are seed oils — olive oil and avocado oil, for example, are plant-based fats extracted from the flesh rather than the seed. And tallow isn’t the only animal fat: Butter, lard and ghee are also in that category. And no matter which cooking fat you choose, you shouldn’t eat too much of any of them, experts said — especially in fried foods. So, what’s the controversy about beef tallow and seed oils all about? Beef tallow is the fat rendered off from the fat trimmings and leftovers from butchering cows, which can include organs and other meat, said Dr. Eric Decker, a professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. It’s primarily a saturated fat, which is mostly found in animal foods. Beef tallow can be made at home or commercially in rendering plants. Home cooks can heat the fat trimmings and other byproducts the stove or in the oven, typically at around 180 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours, said Dr. Cate Shanahan, a family physician in Florida who has long elevated concerns about health impacts of seed oils. That process separates the fat from any proteins, water and other fluids. The contents can then be poured through a cheesecloth into a storage container. At a rendering plant, the process is generally the same, but the fat needs to be cleaned if there are too many free fatty acids, which can harm the tallow’s quality and longevity, Decker said. Similar to what refined oils go through, the tallow may need neutralization — a chemical refining process usually involving an alkaline solution that’s basically baking powder, which separates free fatty acids from the tallow. Then the tallow is ready for cooking. Seed oils are polyunsaturated fats extracted from the seeds of various plants. Canola oil, for one, derives from seeds of the canola, or rapeseed plant, while soybean oil comes from soybean plant seeds. Producing these oils requires industrial processing. The seeds are crushed twice under high heat and pressure then exposed to hexane, a colorless liquid hydrocarbon and solvent, experts said. The hexane dissolves the lipid components in the oil, then is evaporated off and recollected for later use. That results in a crude oil that’s dark in color. “You’re trying to get as pure of a triglyceride fraction as possible,” Decker said. “Some of the things that are in that oil are things like phospholipids,” which emulsify water in the oil and can cause browning when the oil is heated at high temperatures.

      How much coffee is too much, according to a doctor Phospholipids are removed by degumming, which “is basically washing the oil with some citric acid,” Decker said. Next is the neutralization process for removing free fatty acids. There’s also a bleaching step to make the color consistent, Decker said. “It’s also important because some of the oils will have chlorophyll in them, and chlorophyll makes the oil oxidize fast,” he said. The last major step is deodorization, and “that’s just injecting steam through the oil” to remove unappetizing flavors that came from the seeds or from processing, Decker added. Some critics point to the chemical refinement process as a reason why seed oil may be unhealthy, but the chemicals used “are very benign,” Decker said. In “most studies on toxicology of hexane, you only really see problems with people that have occupational exposure — people that really every day are exposed to fairly large levels.” The residual levels in oils, on the other hand, are low and further evaporated when the oils are cooked, said Decker, although he noted there’s little research on the topic. Shanahan, author of “Dark Calories: How Vegetable Oils Destroy Our Health and How We Can Get It Back,” has been a vocal critic of seed oils since 2002, when she said she started learning information that contradicted her medical training. She devised what she calls the “hateful eight” list of seed oils: canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, soybean, sunflower, safflower and rice bran oils. More recently, the movement around seed oil avoidance has taken off online and become a cause for Kennedy, who often argues for improved nutrition as a tool against chronic and infectious disease, while downplaying the protection provided by vaccines and questioning some therapeutics. Much of the concern about seed oils centers on the fact that due to their high linoleic acid content, seed oils have much more omega-6 than omega-3 fatty acids, whereas a balanced ratio of the two in the body is best for health. There’s already an imbalance in the typical Western diet due to widely available seed oils used in fried fast foods and ultraprocessed foods the comprise roughly 70% of the United States’ food supply.

      Red dye No. 3 is now banned in the US. Here’s what studies show about more common dyes Various studies have linked diets too high in omega-6 with inflammation, which is associated with many chronic diseases including cancer, depression, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, diabetes, asthma and arthritis. A federal official says Kennedy’s concern has to do with that imbalance and its possible links to chronic health conditions. “The switch to alternative cooking methods, like beef tallow, is a step closer to ending the chronic disease epidemic and to Make America Healthy Again,” the official said via email. Others, including Shanahan, argue for switching fats based on the chemistry of polyunsaturated fats — the primary fat in seed oils. Saturated fats have a single bond between the carbon atoms in their chains, whereas polyunsaturated fats have one or more double bonds — making them less stable and prone to faster peroxidation when exposed to oxygen or when cooked, according to Dr. Daisy Zamora, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina’s School of Medicine. “Omega-3 fatty acids need to go through enzymatic oxidation for the beneficial derivatives to form,” Zamora said. So while oxidation can be good, Zamora added, peroxidation is a process in which unstable molecules known as free radicals attack fats containing double bonds. Free radicals are linked to cellular damage and oxidative stress, an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body. Peroxidation of these oils may also produce potentially harmful compounds, she said. These factors, as well as the chemical refinement process, are the reasoning behind Shanahan’s “hateful eight” list. Beef tallow can also oxidize and degrade since it has a low amount of unsaturated fat, Decker said, but it takes much longer. Beef tallow also retains more nutrients than seed oils do, though both have some degree of essential fatty acids, experts said. Decker said the risks of harmful products of degradation may not come into play inherently, but rather when the oils are cooked too hot, used repeatedly or kept for too long. Some restaurants are better than others at maintaining their oil quality and controlling temperatures when frying, he added. “There is a potential that people are consuming rancid oil, but we don’t really know a whole lot about how those oxidation products impact health,” Decker said. “That research is very much in its infancy.” Zamora said potential impacts are getting clearer. In her own clinical trials with Dr. Christopher Ramsden of the National Institutes of Health, they investigated the effects of different fatty acids on chronic pain in humans. The diets in her studies are “consistent with dietary guidance for Americans,” Zamora said. “It’s not unhealthy, and it has the average US intake of linoleic acid and omega-3 fatty acids. … But the difference is that we give them bottles of oil that are different.” The low-linoleic acid group received a bottle comprised of 75% macadamia nut oil and 25% olive oil, whereas the high-linoleic acid group’s bottle was 75% corn oil and 25% olive oil.

      Do you need a measles booster? Here’s what experts say “What we have shown is that reducing linoleic acid really does reduce pain in people with chronic migraine,” Zamora said. “That high-omega-3 (and) low-omega-6 group had more reduction in pain compared to just increasing omega-3 alone.” Additionally, Zamora and Ramsden’s 2016 meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials from Minnesota Coronary Experiment of the 1960s and 1970s — which also included previously unpublished data from the experiment — found although replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils does lower LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol, that didn’t translate into decreased deaths from heart disease. It also found that among people who drank or smoked and had high oxidative stress already, there was increased harm from linoleic acid. The analysis results contradicted some of what the Minnesota Coronary Experiment’s takeaways were in the 1970s, which included support for consuming vegetable and seed oils. Other studies have linked seed oil consumption with atherosclerosis or biomarkers of fat buildup in arteries. But much of the research on potential negative health effects of seed oils is in animals — partly due to a lack of funding for seed oil research or nutrition research in general, Zamora and Shanahan said. Until the research on seed oils catches up to the debate, deciding what fat and oils to use in the kitchen can be hard. Decker thinks any policy decisions or nutritional recommendations to avoid seed oils are premature and not based on strong science. He also doesn’t think beef tallow is harmful in moderation.

      Drinking sugary drinks may increase your risk of death. Here are alternative options When people do eat fat, he said, they should consume a variety of sources. That way, if there are “toxicity issues from any of those fats, you decrease your risk of toxicity because you don’t eat a lot of any one thing.” Experts have recommended extra virgin olive oil — primarily a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat, the oil also contains vitamins E and K, antioxidants that help protect against cell damage and inflammation, and cholesterol-lowering oleic acid. Avocado oil and coconut oil are other good options, Shanahan said. While Lichtenstein suggested people look at what the predominance of evidence shows, she also acknowledged that science can evolve, too. “We change on the basis of data. I’m one of the people that was involved in trans fatty acid research, where at one point we were saying, ‘Well, use partially hydrogenated trans-fat that’s made from vegetable oil and use it to replace butter and tallow,’” she said. Then in the 1990s, studies, including one of Lichtenstein’s, showed that partially hydrogenated trans-fat harmed heart health, catalyzing the removal of partially hydrogenated oils from the food supply over time. Similar change happened after experts recommended low-fat diets, only to find they resulted in excessive intake of refined carbohydrates that caused carbohydrate-induced hyperglyceridemia, a condition marked by elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood. Accordingly, in the 2000s many experts began recommending moderate-fat diets. “There were people who were arguing early on that low fat diets weren’t a good idea. Guess what? They were right,” Lichtenstein said. “But that’s what the bulk of the data showed.” “Eventually,” she added, “if everyone is wrong, it’ll come out.” Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.",,0.2075938880443573

Psychiatrist Dr. Blaise Aguirre has become an expert in self-loathing. No, it’s not because he experiences self-hatred. It’s because he has spent decades studying what he considers an epidemic of adolescents who do. Aguirre, a longtime child and adolescent psychiatrist at Mass General Brigham’s McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, spotlights this research in his new book, “I Hate Myself: Overcome Self-Loathing and Realize Why You’re Wrong About You. ” Also an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Aguirre    provides a crash course in self-hatred, explaining what negative self-talk really is, where it comes from, how it can damage a young person’s mental health, and how parents and caregivers can help their teens get through the struggle and learn more constructive ways of thinking. While it’s certainly a trying time to be a teenager, Aguirre knows it’s not just societal pressures that make life hard. Early experiences and parenting styles can also shape a child’s self-perception and emotional health. But it’s possible for parents to protect their kids against some of that self-hatred, Aguirre said. And for kids who have experienced self-loathing, it’s also possible for them  eventually to reclaim their self-worth. One type of proven treatment is known as dialectical behavior therapy, or DBT. This is one of Aguirre’s areas of expertise. As founding director of McLean’s adolescent DBT program, called 3East, he put together an array of DBT programs to target reducing self-endangering behaviors as well as the symptoms of borderline personality disorder traits. Aguirre said this approach has saved lives. CNN recently talked with Aguirre about teens’ self-hatred and why self-perception is such a huge part of how they interact with the rest of the world. This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What is self-hatred? Dr. Blaise Aguirre: Most people have experienced dissatisfaction in their lives and in themselves. You can have a degree of self-criticism in certain contexts, and that happens to everybody. That’s just part of the human experience. But what if from very, very early on you were told that you were just not good enough, that you were flawed as a human being? And maybe it wasn’t overtly stated, but it was implied in some way, or at least that as a young mind that’s the way that you interpreted things. Lots of things can lead to that. If somebody has a learning disability, a physical disability or a mental disorder, they can just feel that they’re not good enough. They might think, “I’m not fast enough, I’m not pretty enough, I’m not strong enough.” There are lots of ways in which we can be unhappy with ourselves. But when the idea of not being enough is so profound that it becomes embedded in how you see yourself and pervades your entire being, it can become self-hatred. When that happens, self-loathing starts to impact a lot of the decisions you make, the jobs you apply to, the schools you go to, the romantic partners you pick. I’m talking about something that is embedded in the core of who a person is. That’s what self-hatred is all about. Related article
      Teens feel less emotional support than their parents think they do, new report shows CNN: What causes this self-hatred? Aguirre: Some people have asked me: “Is there a biological underpinning to self-hatred?” The one thing that I’ve seen is that almost all the people I meet who experience core self-hatred are highly sensitive people. People who have big emotional reactions to seemingly small events seem to be much more vulnerable to interpreting the world in a very negative way — and then embedding that interpretation into their concept of self. Independent of that, in all my interviews, no one reported developing self-hatred in adulthood. It all started somewhere in kindergarten, or in someone’s early years, in middle school. Many of them were young women, many of them had physical and sexual abuse, many experienced a lot of hurtful bullying. Without somebody being there for them, they embedded this information into their minds. Because they didn’t have perspective, they came to the natural conclusion that there was something very flawed about who they are. It just became integrated in their sense of self. If you teach a young child that 1 + 1 = 3 and you keep teaching it and at the end of the year you give them an exam and you say, “What’s 1 + 1?” they’re going to say it’s 3. The message that they learn, whether intentional or not, is that they’re not worthy and they’re deserving of self-criticism. Once you’ve got this  certainty integrated into your sense of self, you’re going to filter all future interactions through that lens. CNN: To what extent does technology contribute to the problem? Aguirre: Big companies have learned how to use technology to market to self-hatred. The messages are: You’re not tall enough, you’re not pretty enough, your skin doesn’t look young enough, you’re not thin enough, you’re not strong enough, your muscles aren’t big enough, and you’re not smart enough. These messages also imply, “If you buy my product, you’re going to be so much better.” That is problematic. We must pay attention to how much we are sending young people the message that if they just did this, they’d be better. Related article
      How teens view social media’s impact on their mental health CNN: How is self-hatred different from depression? Aguirre: Somebody who’s depressed might be very dissatisfied with their life during their episode of depression and say, “I hate how I’m living” or “I hate that I’m not getting out of bed and going to work.” It’s not self-hatred per se, but it’s hatred of the impact of depression, hatred of the circumstances. For people with core self-hatred, even when depression is treated, the self-hatred persists. I’ve worked with patients who have eating disorders; a lot of these people are perfectionistic and hate themselves because they believe they aren’t the right body size or shape or weight. But when people with eating disorders also have core self-hatred, even when you treat the eating disorder, the self-hatred persists. There are certainly situations where after you treat an underlying mental health condition the unhappiness and dissatisfaction lifts. But with people who experience core self-hatred, people who have an underlying “undeservedness” and shame, even when you treat the underlying condition, it doesn’t lift. Related article
      5 things to do when you’re depressed CNN: To what extent can medication help? Aguirre: What I see as a psychiatrist is that many of the young people who experience self-hatred are often highly sensitive people who come in on polypharmacy, meaning they are currently taking lots and lots of different classes of medications. With some of them, I’m impressed by the fact that they’re still standing. I think that what happens is that to alleviate the pain of emotional suffering, they go from psychiatrist to psychiatrist hoping to find something that’s going to take away the pain. Where psychopharmacology sometimes does a person a disservice is how it numbs the person from the pain. If you have a toothache and I keep giving you painkillers to numb the toothache, I might be doing you some damage because you could have an underlying infection that is eventually going to erupt. Numbing a person from their feelings isn’t the right treatment for self-hatred. Self-hatred doesn’t shift with medication. Related article
      With the decline in youth mental health comes another concerning trend, study finds CNN: What is the right treatment for self-hatred? Aguirre: For starters, we experts can do a better job of asking about it. In a standard psychiatric questionnaire, they’ll ask you about hearing voices, eating habits, sleeping habits, self-care, energy and guilt. No one asks about self-hatred. In psychiatric evaluations, asking about self-hatred is not standard. We don’t ask about it because patients don’t bring it up — because it’s embedded. They are aware it’s there, but they don’t see it as separate. They don’t see how it’s a problem. We need to target self-hatred in mental health. We also can do a better job of giving people tools to deal with self-hatred. I use a form of treatment known as dialectical behavior therapy, or DBT, for people who are self-injurious and self-destructive. DBT has four skill sets: mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation and distress tolerance. Related article
      Despite some gains, teens — especially girls — are still struggling with their mental health since the pandemic, report shows Many parents will tell you that their children come into DBT treatment without skills and leave with new abilities. For most kids, the ability to apply DBT skills to life’s circumstances and context works very, very well. We see reductions in suicidal thinking, reductions in self-injury, a better ability to tolerate distress and all those sorts of things. For a lot of those kinds of behavioral deficits, teaching you the skills that are going to manage that deficit is the way to go. CNN: How can parents change their approach to make things easier for kids experiencing self-hatred? Aguirre: Validation is important. When a child is really struggling, to authentically listen and not try to reassure them, that can make a difference. Try not to say, “You’re lovable. You’ve got lots of friends. You’re going to be OK,” and instead listen to how painful things are for them. Related article
      Teens are feeling pressured and burned out. Here’s how to help When they’re done, sit with them and then ask, “Are there things that I’m doing that are perpetuating this? Tell me more about how difficult it is.” The idea is to sit with them without trying to solve the problem, at least until they feel heard and you have a deep understanding of the problem. For highly sensitive kids especially, just listening so that the child begins to have a sense of emotional safety is key. It can make a huge difference on the road to liking themselves a little more.

You’re standing in line at the supermarket or drugstore when a stranger speaks up. “Hello, how are you?” the stranger greets you. “Good, and you?” might be your response. Your conversation partner might proceed to talk to you about something trivial — the weather outside, the latest game, an annoyance during the morning commute or something silly the person’s dog did that morning. It’s nothing that matters much, but you’ve suddenly found yourself participating in small talk. Some people might dread the seemingly insignificant conversation or think it’s not worth their time, while others may delight in the light exchange. In most cases, especially with strangers or acquaintances, small talk is unavoidable as both parties try to find common ground. “It’s communication that we use to orient and acquaint ourselves with other people, (and) it’s the gateway to deeper, richer talk,” said Matt Abrahams, a lecturer in organizational behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “Chances are, somebody in your friendship group, if not more, you met through a small talk situation.” For people without much practice in small talk, the challenge may feel daunting. But there are ways to get better at this form of communication. And it’s worthwhile to try, as the exchanges can positively affect a person’s overall well-being, Abrahams said. Here’s what experts want people to know about the benefits of small talk. People facing the prospect of small talk may put too much pressure on themselves to perform well when meeting someone for the first time. They also may worry about the daunting act of speaking spontaneously, which requires thinking on the spot and responding fast to keep the conversation going, said Abrahams, who hosts the podcast “Think Fast, Talk Smart,” to share tips for strategic communication. So why should you do it? Whether or not you seek out small talk or avoid it at all costs, research has shown that light conversations with people you don’t know well can have beneficial effects on health and well-being, such as boosting your mood and decreasing your feelings of isolation.

      People are lonely. Small steps in your community can make a difference “(Small talk) is something that we psychologists think is kind of fundamental. It’s like (how) we need food, we need water — we need to feel like we belong and that we matter to other people,” said Dr. Gillian Sandstrom, an associate professor in the psychology of kindness at the UK’s University of Sussex who has researched the effects of minimal social interactions. Then-US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declared loneliness an epidemic in the United States in 2023. Daily loneliness affects 1 in 5 adults in the US, the highest level in two years, according to Gallup data from October. By having a light conversation with an acquaintance or stranger, people can feel more connected with one another and have a stronger sense of community, said Sandstrom, whose research has shown that those who have more casual daily interactions, such as talking to a neighbor or a barista at a coffee shop, feel a greater sense of belonging. “Talking to strangers can feel scary because we don’t know what’s going to happen, but also that’s kind of exciting,” Sandstrom said. “It’s fun and it’s nice to have some unexpected thing happen, where we learn something new or see a new perspective.” In some scenarios, such as an upcoming work or networking event, people can prepare ahead of time for the expected spontaneous conversations, said Dr. Sunita Sah, an organizational psychologist and professor of management and organizations at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Researching people ahead of time who you know will be at an event and planning questions to ask can help to alleviate nerves, Sah said. In more spontaneous moments, there are tricks to making good conversation. The easiest method is to make an observation about your shared surroundings, which is why people often talk about the weather, or to ask people general questions to learn more about them, Sah said. (That’s why people often ask if you did anything interesting over the weekend or if you have any vacation plans.) Related article
      A strong relationship needs both partners to respond to each other’s ‘bids for connection.’ Here’s what that means This kind of conversation isn’t a tennis match, where one needs to get the ball back to the other side of the court as fast as possible. Abrahams said he likes to think of this exchange more as a game of hacky sack — in which the goal is to be collaborative to keep the sack in the air. “You have to coordinate with the other person, so I want to set you up, so then you can set me back up. It’s about being interested, not interesting, and that mindset shift is important,” he said. Sometimes slowing down and taking a beat before responding can reduce rambling and give more clarity and structure to an answer. “People will feel in small talk and other spontaneous speaking situations that they have to respond immediately, (but) you can say, ‘Give me a second to think about that.’ Or you can ask a clarifying question that gives yourself time to think,” Abrahams added. Like anything, small talk gets better with practice, Sandstrom said. If someone goes a long time without socializing in casual settings, small talk might seem scarier than it is. In her research, Sandstrom found that the more people engage in small talk, the more confident they become in their social skills and the less worried they are about rejection, she said.

      Why the dinner party is a declining art At the end of the day, small talk is meant to be lighthearted and enjoyable, and a little humor and compassion go a long way, Sah said. “I personally really love small talk. I think it gives you lovely interactions with people throughout the day that you probably don’t want to go deeper with,” Sah said. “It really does build rapport and trust and some level of friendliness. “In today’s age where everybody can just revert to their phones or go days without speaking to someone, I think that small talk (helps) take away the loneliness aspect.”",,0.17972493171691895

What West Virginia lawmaker Adam Burkhammer “once thought was a conspiracy theory became reality” to him recently. The Republican state delegate had been witnessing “the adverse effects that synthetic dyes were having on my son’s behavior, and the improvement of focus and attention” when he removed foods with the dyes from his son’s diet, Burkhammer told CNN via email. Inspired by this experience, he worked with the West Virginia Legislature last month to introduce House Bill 2354, which sought to ban the use of artificial food dyes in schools and, eventually, foods sold statewide. Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, signed that bill into law on March 24. It’s the latest in a series of actions by many US states aiming to ban or restrict use of the additives due to health concerns, including potential effects on learning and attention among children, and the risk of cancer in animals.

      Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says beef tallow is healthier than seed oils. Is he right? But West Virginia’s law is the most sweeping so far, prohibiting seven dyes and two preservatives: red dyes No. 3 and No. 40, yellow dyes No. 5 and No. 6, blue dyes No. 1 and No. 2, green dye No. 3, butylated hydroxyanisole, and propylparaben. All these dyes are made from petroleum and are used to make food and beverages brightly colored and more appealing to consumers. The dyes portion of the West Virginia law will be enacted in schools beginning August 1. Then the dyes portion and the section on butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will take effect statewide on January 1, 2028. “West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there’s no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,” Morrisey said in a news release, referring to the slogan used by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal critic of artificial dyes. “By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we’re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.” Two weeks earlier, Kennedy had met executives of top US food companies and later posted on X that they had a “great discussion” that day about “advancing food safety and radical transparency to protect the health of all Americans, especially our children. We will strengthen consumer trust by getting toxins out of our food.” Morrisey’s decision follows those of California, whose legislature banned red dye No. 3 statewide in October 2023 and six other common dyes, including red dye No. 40, from use in school foods in August 2024. The US Food and Drug Administration banned red dye No. 3 in January, effective for food on January 15, 2027, and for drugs on January 18, 2028. And on March 21, Virginia passed a law banning colorants from school food, effective July 1, 2027. California has been a leader in banning food dyes and other additives, but the movement isn’t limited to Democratic-controlled states. Many of these bills, by both Democratic and Republican legislators, have been introduced in the time leading up to or following Kennedy’s confirmation as US health secretary. And some Republican legislators also invoke Kennedy’s “MAHA” motto in their proposals. Besides California, Virginia and West Virginia, there are currently 23 other states across the political spectrum seeking to ban dyes and other additives, according to a tracker by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization, reflecting a bipartisan push toward a safer food system.

      RFK Jr. wants to eliminate FDA’s controversial food additive program. Here’s why that matters “It is a shift, and it’s remarkable,” said Dr. Jerold Mande, CEO of Nourish Science, a nongovernmental organization focused on nutrition crises in the United States. “So many Americans are sick, and that illness is not partisan. It affects people of all incomes, of all beliefs.” The financial costs of chronic disease may be another factor spurring governors into action, said Mande, who is also an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Here’s what research shows about possible health harms and what anyone concerned can do to avoid food dyes before restrictions take effect. What’s happening across the country The proposed restrictions vary across states. The Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana and Massachusetts bills, for example, seek to ban blue No. 1 and No. 2, green No. 3, red No. 40 and yellow No. 5 and No. 6 from school foods. Senate bills in Missouri and Florida are attempting to eliminate generally the same dyes from schools, while House bills in the same states would require just a warning label on foods (containing these additives) sold anywhere else. The Connecticut and Indiana bills would ban food dyes universally. “In the absence of federal regulation, many states are stepping up and taking a crucial step in protecting children and adults from toxic food dyes,” Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, said via email. The variation in these bills — some of which also include propositions to ban other chemicals that aren’t dyes — may be, in part, a strategy to push the FDA to change its protocols, Mande said. “Companies will have to make different products for different states, and that just would be a nightmare for them,” he added. “Quickly, companies see that they need an across-the-board federal standard and will push for that.” Related article
      Are antidepressants addictive? Experts weigh in on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s comments That’s what industry associations are already seeking. The National Confectioners Association said in a statement that there is a role for state legislators to play in the US food system, but that the FDA is the “rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety.” Some of the association’s member companies sell products containing artificial dyes. “Food safety is the number one priority for U.S. confectionery companies, and we will continue to follow and comply with FDA’s guidance and safety standards,” the association added via email. John Hewitt, senior vice president of state affairs at the Consumer Brands Association, echoed this sentiment, saying it’s why the trade association has urged the FDA to “aggressively acknowledge its responsibility as the nation’s food safety regulator.” CNN contacted the FDA for comment but did not hear back before publication. The science on food dyes Governments, researchers and nonprofit organizations have long raised concerns about artificial dyes. “The overwhelming evidence shows that synthetic dyes cause neurobehavioral problems in some children, making it difficult for them to learn,” said Faber, also an adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. “Despite this, the Food and Drug Administration has not thoroughly reviewed these dyes for decades, nor taken any action to regulate them aside from banning Red 3 in January.” Red No. 3, red No. 40, blue No. 2 and green No. 3 all have been linked with cancer or tumors in animals. Other sources say red No. 40 and yellow No. 5 and No. 6 contain or may be contaminated with known carcinogens. Blue No. 1 and yellow No. 6 may also be toxic to some human cells. And as little as 1 milligram of yellow dye No. 5 may cause irritability, restlessness and sleep disturbances for sensitive children. Related video
      Eggs will be expensive for a long time. Here’s the substitute you never thought of What may explain the relationship between artificial dyes and negative health outcomes is unknown, experts have said. Researchers also aren’t fully certain about risk levels and whether they depend on the dye — largely due to a lack of funding for nutritional research, Mande said. Some animal studies have shown that dyes are quickly metabolized and excreted through urine, but dyes may still have a cumulative effect on the body, Dr. Michael Hansen, a senior scientist at Consumer Reports, told CNN in January. Consumer Reports is a nonprofit helping consumers evaluate goods and services. The potential of an accumulative effect is partly why much of the concern about food dyes is focused on children — since they, in addition to being in critical periods for development, also have smaller bodies. Cutting dyes from your diet If you want to avoid artificial dyes, read ingredient lists of food and beverage products when you’re shopping, experts said — and note that dyes are also found in products that aren’t conspicuously colorful. Some restaurants have ingredient lists on their websites. Dyes are mostly found in ultraprocessed foods and beverages, so avoiding those products is one shortcut, Dr. Jennifer Pomeranz, associate professor of public health policy and management at New York University, told CNN in January. On ingredient lists, these artificial dyes are sometimes referred to using the following terms: Dyes listed with the word “lake” indicate the dye is a fat-soluble version, meaning it can dissolve in oily foods or drinks.

A growing body of evidence has increasingly linked diet sodas and other no- or low-calorie foods with weight gain — so much so that the World Health Organization issued an advisory in May 2023 saying not to use sugar substitutes for weight loss. “Replacing free sugars with non-sugar sweeteners does not help people control their weight long-term,” Dr. Francesco Branca, director of WHO’s department of nutrition and food safety, said at the time. Now, a new study may shed light on why consuming too much of the artificial sweetener sucralose could be counterproductive. Instead of the brain sending a signal to eat less, sucralose triggers an increase in appetite when consumed in a drink. “Sucralose activates the area in the brain that regulates hunger, and that activation, in turn, is linked to greater ratings of hunger,” said lead study author Dr. Katie Page, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and director of the Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles. In fact, people who drank water with sucralose said their appetite increased by nearly 20% compared with drinking water with table sugar, Page said. In the United States, sucralose is a key ingredient in some Splenda sugar substitutes. In Europe, sucralose is known as E955 and is found in sugar substitutes sold under the brand names Candys, Canderel Yellow, Cukren, Nevella, Splenda, SucraPlus, Sukrana and Zerocal. The study only investigated the impact of sucralose and did not research other popular artificials sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame-K and sodium saccharin. Related article
      Ultraprocessed foods make up to 70% of the US food supply. How to reduce your intake “This is a very high quality study, using state of the art methods and careful analysis,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine, via email. Katz, founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine, was not involved in the study. The authors interpreted their results carefully yet make a strong case that “non-caloric sweeteners, and sucralose specifically, interfere with normal appetite regulation in ways that could have adverse effects on weight control and health,” Katz said. A spokesperson for Heartland Food Products Group, which manufactures Splenda, said that low-calorie and zero-calorie sweeteners are backed by research and expert recommendations. “Low- or zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are recommended by healthcare professionals, food safety experts and credible health organizations for diabetes and weight management based on trusted scientific research showing that the impact of low- or zero-calorie sweeteners on body weight is similar to that of water, and that sweet-tasting products have decreased the want for additional sweets while also helping people manage weight, reduce intake of calories from added sugars, and manage blood sugar levels,” the spokesperson wrote via email. Study findings support prior research The idea that artificial sweeteners may be increasing hunger signals from the mammalian brain isn’t new — a prior study coauthored by Page  found women and people with obesity were especially sensitive. “Animal studies have hinted at some of these effects,” Katz said. However, “this is, to my knowledge, the most decisive study to date in humans of direct effects on the appetite center.” All cells in the body require glucose for energy. The brain is the biggest user, gobbling up to half of all sugars circulating in the blood. Nature, however,  designed the brain to respond to natural sugars such as glucose found in whole fruits and some vegetables. Artificial sweeteners, therefore, appear to confuse the brain, Page said, by sending signals of sweetness without delivering the needed calories the brain requires. Scientists have hypothesized that when those promised calories don’t arrive, the brain may send out a signal to eat more. Same people, three drinks The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature Metabolism, asked 75 people to consume one of three drinks on three separate occasions: plain water, water sweetened with table sugar (sucrose), and water sweetened with sucralose. During each visit, the research team tested participants’ fasting blood sugar levels, followed by a brain scan called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI, which tracks blood flow to capture activity in different regions of the brain. “They came out of the scanner and consumed one of the three drinks, and went back into the scanner,” Page said. One glass contained 300 milliliters of water and 75 grams (about 2.5 ounces) of sugar (sucrose), which is the equivalent of a 16-ounce can of sugary soda, Page said. Another drink contained enough sucralose to match that sweetness. Sucralose is about 600 times sweeter than sugar, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. The third drink was plain water, which served as a control. Related article
      Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says beef tallow is healthier than seed oils. Is he right? During the brain scanning, Page and her team did another round of blood sampling at 10 minutes, 35 minutes and 120 minutes after consuming the drink and asked participants to rate their hunger level. “(The study) is particularly strong because it used repeated measures within the same participants and included different methods such as brain imaging, blood draws, and subjective ratings to test their hypothesis,” said Kyle Burger, a scientist at the nonprofit Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, which investigates human senses of taste and smell. Burger was not involved in the study. Three possible explanations In addition to finding that drinks with sucralose increased the sensation of hunger by about 17%, Page and her team found increased connections to other parts of the brain responsible for controlling motivation. “Sucralose appears to affect your decision-making skills,” Page said. “For example, we found increased brain connectivity between the hypothalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex, which controls the risks and rewards of a decision.” In addition, blood tests showed sucralose had no effect on hormones the brain uses to tell when we are satisfied and no longer hungry, Page said. “There’s no signal, no signal at all,” she said. “There’s a sweetness signal, but there’s no hormone signal telling you you’re full. Sucralose doesn’t have an effect on those hormones.” Not everyone, however, may feel the combined effects of sucralose in the same way, Katz said. “Those with insulin resistance, for instance, may be especially prone to disruption of normal appetite control with sucralose,” he said. What to do? Recommendations on how to manage the body’s reactions to artificial sweeteners are currently complex, Page said. For example, the American Diabetes Association tells people with insulin resistance and diabetes to use no-calorie drinks and foods, but sparingly. “I’m an endocrinologist so I see patients for diabetes and obesity,” Page said. “I would never say drink or eat more sugar. “Instead, I tell my patients to not rely on non-caloric sweeteners as a substitute for sugar and try to reduce the overall intake of dietary sweeteners in general,” she said. Katz agreed, preferring to suggest a form of taste bud “rehab” that can reduce overall use of sugars, no matter what their form. “A truly wholesome diet has little added sugar in the first place, and thus no sugar to ‘replace’ with sucralose and related compounds,” Katz said.

      What your kids drink matters, this doctor says Just as many people have cut their use of salt, it’s possible to cut your use of sweeteners by teaching taste buds to desire fewer sweets, he said. Taste buds will respond by finding sugary foods that used to be delicious now cloyingly sweet, or in the case of sodium, much too salty, research has shown. Start out by finding hidden sources of sugar in foods you may not realize are sweetened, Katz told CNN in a prior interview. “If I asked you to boycott all the desserts in your life, you would probably rebel or fail,” Katz said. “But there is a massive amount of added sugar and sweeteners hiding in foods that are not sweet — in salad dressing, pasta sauce, bread, crackers, even salty chips.” By choosing products without sweeteners, he said, it’s possible to reduce a person’s daily intake of sugar or sweeteners “by a third, maybe even a half as many grams a day before we even lay a hand on anything that you actually expect to be sweet.”",,0.2944956421852112

If there is one thing therapists and family lawyers can count on, it’s a steady stream of couples coming to them and considering divorce. Holidays, birthdays and other major milestones are often times when people start evaluating their relationships, said Marissa Nelson, a Washington, DC-based marriage and family therapist. Related article
      Marriage rates are up, and divorce rates are down, new data shows “We’re either going to figure this out (and) that means action, couples therapy, retreats, individual therapy, workshops or … divorce’,” she said patients tell her. Some couples crumble over the weight of difficult life circumstances, but others learn to work together and come out stronger, said Samantha Klein, a partner and head of the California family law practice for the law firm Withersworldwide. You should try everything you can before heading into divorce and carefully consider whether it’s a road you want to go down, she cautioned. That’s because the process is hard — logistically, emotionally and financially. That said, there are ways you can navigate conflict and divorce for better outcomes and a kinder uncoupling, Klein said. Here’s what the experts say. Divorce should not be entered into lightly, said Dr. Monica O’Neal, a Boston psychologist. But some circumstances raise big flags that it might be a good option. “No. 1, obviously, would be if somebody’s safety really was at risk, whether that’s from any of the types of abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, any kind of abuse,” she added. If abuse is involved, O’Neal advised leaving as quickly as you can, because the longer you stay, the more violent it can become. While physical abuse is often clearest to identify, it’s not the only kind of abuse that you should take seriously, she added. Emotional abuse is about power and control, Nelson said. Signs that someone is emotionally abusing you include their being demeaning, insulting, threatening, controlling, limiting of your contact with friends and family, humiliating, intimidating, shaming, and dismissive of your needs and wants, she added. “All of these different things start to erode your sense of self, your self-esteem, your self-concept, and also your sense of reality,” Nelson said. Related article
      The bright side of divorce, according to experts Infidelity is often cited as a condition that would make someone leave a relationship without question, but it can be a complicated decision, O’Neal said. “I’ve seen many couples bounce back from infidelity,” she said. “Infidelity is one of those things that can be talked about, it can be discussed, it can be processed.” Often infidelity is connected to other problems that need to be resolved. If a couple can get to a place where they can discuss those deeper issues, they can sometimes build a new, better, healthier relationship, O’Neal added. However, it’s always important to take care of yourself and any children that may be part of the family. “Think about creating safety first, and if that means you have to be out of the relationship in order to be safe, then that’s what you should do absolutely,” O’Neal said. Some circumstances that can strain a relationship are harder to identify as either a part of the ups and downs of life or a sign that your relationship isn’t working. Sometimes differing views on parenting, disagreements on what to do with a parent who needs care, feeling unsupported in a stressful period or losing intimacy can pose significant challenges. Often it isn’t the issue itself that makes or breaks the relationship –– it’s how you handle it, Nelson said. “Everything (besides abuse) is solvable, for the most part,” she said. “There are a lot of things that are solvable, but it’s going to require good communication, and it’s going to require compromise, and it’s going to require really being able to hold space for each other’s realities in big decision-making. There is no space for being dogmatic about your stance.” Is your partner willing to go to couples therapy? For some people, therapy is scary, but will they work through that fear, try reading books about relationships, or talk to a religious leader or someone else? If you can come to respect one another’s perspectives, work together, compromise and stay open to changing your shared plan as needed, that commitment can go a long way, Nelson said. “If there is an unwillingness to change, an unwillingness to do couples therapy, an unwillingness to seek out support to work through these challenges,” that is a sign the relationship might not work, Nelson said. Individual therapy can also be a great help, even if your partner won’t do couples counseling, O’Neal added. That way, you can identify what you are bringing into the relationship and what you can do to strengthen it, if you choose to do so. Even if you think your relationship is headed for divorce, Marilyn Chinitz, partner in the matrimonial department of New York law firm Blank Rome, recommends digging deep to uncover the root problems in your relationship first. “When I meet a client and they come in and they’re not 100% sure that they want to get a divorce, I will give them recommendations of three therapists, and I tell them, spend your money and time there,” she said. “I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.” If you have weighed all the factors and decide to move forward with divorce, there are many new decisions to make. “No matter how much divorce might be the best thing for you or your relationship, and you’ve come to terms with that, divorce is still a loss,” Nelson said. Maybe you’re grieving the loss of your identity as a married person, a vision for your future, having your children under your roof all the time, or even just having someone to share dinner with at the end of the day. Regardless, the loss that comes from divorce can send you on a roller coaster of unexpected emotions, she said. People can act out when they are in pain, but it’s vital that you address your feelings head-on to heal from them, Nelson said. “If you don’t let this relationship go, it will eat you up,” she said. “If you’re still holding on to it, that will erode your sense of self and also make it harder for you to open your heart again to love in the future.” Related article
      These tips might help you ‘unbreak’ your heart after losing someone Lean on the support of your friends, family and potentially a therapist. What’s more, try to keep in mind what you want life to look like after your divorce to make the best decisions you can during the process, O’Neal said. She posed questions you should contemplate: Where do you want to be five years after? How do you want the divorce to feel for your kids? How do you want things to feel between you and your ex-partner at the end? “You don’t have to be friends. And you’re still going to grieve. It’s going to feel awful. It’s really going to feel like a death of something,” she said. Still keeping that goal of what you want your life to look like on the other side helps you get to that better life. A kind divorce is especially important when kids are involved. “A parent needs to appreciate and to understand that just because the marriage is ending, their roles as parents are not ending,” O’Neal said. The goal is to raise children with healthy relationships with both parents and set them up for success for the rest of their lives –– and that means not leaning on them or bad-mouthing their other parent, she added. “Your children are not bystanders,” Nelson said. “You have to get yourself into therapy and work through what you’ve been through so that you can learn how to consciously uncouple and co-parent.” If you had issues communicating during your marriage, Nelson said you’re going to have to do better, during and after the divorce.

      A single mother speaks out on how the ‘tradwife’ lifestyle led to her divorce Even if their other parent is behaving badly or talking poorly about you, the best step is not to fire back, O’Neal said. Instead, explain to your children that they don’t need to defend you to your ex. But give them tools and space to help cope with the conflict. “Anything that comes up that sounds hard to hear, come back and we can talk about it,” O’Neal recommended saying to your children. “I’m not going to tell on you, and if I need to, I’m going to ask you if I can say something to your parent about it.” The divorce is also happening to your kids, and they need a clear avenue of support and to know both of their parents love them, she added. And don’t think your children aren’t affected just because they are older, Nelson said. For college students and older adult children, divorce can hurt as much, if not more, “because their sense of home, or their sense of family is with their parents,” she said. “That can shake their foundation, as they have just launched.” A postnuptial agreement may be a good idea for couples who aren’t sure about a divorce yet, said Nicky Rooz, lead of the East Coast family law practice for Withersworldwide. Laying out what would happen in the event of a divorce can answer the question of whether you can afford the legal process of permanent separation, she said. You are making those decisions when you likely are still working on the relationship and are more likely to be kind to one another. Then you put the agreement aside and focus on the emotional elements of the relationship, Rooz added. If you decide you can’t save the relationship, there are many ways to divorce, she added. A bitter court battle isn’t necessary, Rooz said. “You can mediate. You can do collaborative law.” Avoiding a scenario involving the courts can yield some of the best outcomes because the two people who know the relationship best are deciding how to end it, she said.

      What is no-fault divorce, and why do some conservatives want to get rid of it? Moreover, the professionals you hire can have a great impact on the way your divorce unfolds, Klein said. “Is the person you’re hiring somebody who is settlement focused, or are they going to recommend that you go to court right away? Is it somebody who sends letters that are respectful and civil and productive to opposing counsel, or somebody who sends letters that are aggressive unnecessarily and argumentative unnecessarily?” she asked. Your lawyer can just as easily say the same thing in a kind way as an aggressive one, said Atlanta-based family law attorney Randall Kessler. And not only does approaching the legalities with respect help maintain your dignity, it also is looked on more favorably by judges, he added. Divorce is scary, and you will likely have to do a lot of work to understand your financial situation, how your lifestyle may change afterward and what happens to your home, Klein said. But it doesn’t have to be a worst-case scenario, she added, especially if you aren’t shy about reaching out to resources such as accountants, financial advisers and reputable lawyers.",,0.17280955612659454
"Editor’s note: If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship, help is available at the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233 or text 88788. A new Netflix docuseries reveals never-before-seen details about the story of travel vlogger Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman killed by her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, during a cross-country road trip in 2021. Like many domestic violence cases, the story depicted in “American Murder: Gabby Petito” sparked outrage over the lack of intervention before the young woman’s strangled remains were found in Wyoming’s Bridger-Teton National Forest. (Laundrie later died by suicide, according to a medical examiner.) Petito’s case is one of many domestic violence tragedies involving young people that continue to provoke anger and fear, and that’s especially true when these cases involve teenagers. In the United States, teen dating violence remains common, with about 1 in 3 teenagers experiencing physical, sexual, emotional or verbal abuse from a dating partner, according to statistics from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The consequences of teen dating violence can be both immediate and long-lasting.Victims are more likely to face depression, anxiety and substance abuse and have aggressive behavior and suicidal thoughts, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Navigating healthy relationships can be challenging for both teens and parents, but caution and open communication are critical to prevent acts of violence. Many people associate physical violence, such as pushing, hitting or even sexual assault, with abusive relationships, but a form of psychological violence called coercive control is also common in such relationships. This tactic is used to exert power over someone, typically to instill feelings of isolation and fear, said Sherry Hamby, a distinguished research professor of psychology at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, and director of the Life Paths Research Center, which is dedicated to promoting resilience and social justice in marginalized communities. Common signs of coercive control might include demanding to know a partner’s whereabouts or forcing them to share their location, pressuring for explicit photos or other information such as passwords, as well as engaging in isolating behaviors, such as discouraging a partner from seeing friends, family members or others perceived as a “threat” to the relationship. Many teens struggle to recognize these unhealthy dynamics, especially because pop culture often portrays jealousy as a sign of love. However, control-driven behaviors are usually red flags for deeper issues, said Dr. Krista Mehari, a licensed clinical psychologist and assistant professor in the department of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Related article
      A strong relationship needs both partners to respond to each other’s ‘bids for connection.’ Here’s what that means Sexual victimization is another key concern teens and parents should be aware of. Even if an incident doesn’t involve rape, coercion of any kind — forced kissing, nonconsensual touching or pressure to engage in sexual activities — is still considered sexual assault. Consent must always be explicit, enthusiastic and ongoing, meaning it can change at any point during an interaction, Hamby said. Additionally, reproductive coercion, which includes pressuring a partner to have unprotected sex, lying about contraception or manipulating a partner into having a baby, is another form of abuse that teens may not easily recognize, according to Hamby. To help teens examine the health of their romantic relationships, Hamby recommends parents and guardians engage in frequent check-ins to take note of any changes or problems. Teens should ensure they aren’t being insulted or put down in a relationship, particularly when it comes to criticisms about their appearance or weight. For those who are involved in sports or general interest activities, a supportive partner should encourage them to continue these hobbies and be happy to see them thrive. Hamby noted older teens in high school should be mindful of behaviors that hinder their personal growth. A partner should support the other’s decision to pursue college or job opportunities that best suit their lifestyle and well-being. Related article
      These early red flags predict a partner’s likelihood to become abusive, study finds More obvious signs of dating violence include blatant threats, damage or destruction of any kind of property, or aggressive physical advances. Parents and caregivers can observe a teen’s relationships for these warning signs to help identify abuse that adolescents might overlook. Intervening in a teen’s relationship can be tricky, with adolescents tending to resist oversight from parents or caregivers. Instead, Hamby suggests sharing resources with information about both abusive and healthy relationships, allowing teens to explore them independently rather than feeling pressured. Another approach is bringing in a trusted outside source, such as another family member, coach or religious leader whom the teen sees as a more objective guide. Girls and young women are often taught to avoid saying “no” to be polite, which can make them vulnerable to sexual coercion later in life, Vanderbilt’s Mehari said. Teaching children to assert boundaries early on can help them navigate these situations confidently before they enter the dating world. Since conversations about sensitive subjects can sometimes feel awkward, Hamby suggests taking advantage of long car rides to provide a more relaxed setting for open discussions. Parents and guardians play a crucial role in demonstrating respect, communication, kindness and boundaries as they model healthy relationships for their kids. However, leading by example may not always be enough, which is why adults should focus on explicit guidance for handling relationship challenges. Since some teens may be hesitant to open up about their relationship struggles, use pop culture as a conversation starter. Discussing relationship dynamics from a TV show or movie can provide a low-stakes way to distinguish between healthy and harmful behaviors. Mehari pointed to the example of the popular Christmastime song “Baby, It’s Cold Outside,” which some critics say romanticizes coercion and disregards consent. Use this song as an opportunity to discuss what to do if someone won’t take “no” for an answer. Parents and guardians can also initiate conversations based on real-life relationships their teen observes, such as divorced friends or peer relationships at school, creating less personal and emotionally charged discussions.

"Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. Did you remember to wear your red-light glasses, eat two kiwi fruit, take your supplements, insert your nostril expanders and make sure your room is completely dark before heading to bed? Forget the simple bedtime routine of brushing your teeth, washing your face and putting on pajamas. Now people in search of the perfect sleep routine are adding steps that can include supplements, specific foods, certain apps and other devices, and a layered beauty routine. For some, these practices are part of a regimen called “sleepmaxxing,” a collection of activities, products or “hacks” used simultaneously to optimize sleep quality and quantity, said Dr. Anita Shelgikar, director of the sleep medicine fellowship and clinical professor of neurology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, via email. Related article
      Resistance training is the right way to tire your brain and body for better sleep, according to a study While sleepmaxxing’s origin hasn’t been attributed to a single source, it has become popular among TikTok users trying to improve their sleep. Videos tagged “#sleepmaxxing” have amassed hundreds of thousands of views. “In the past, it was thought that sleep wasn’t important,” said Dr. Jag Sunderram, professor of medicine at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. People would say, “‘Oh, I get very little sleep, and I get away with that because I need to be able to function and do a lot.’” “I think the trend towards understanding that sleep is actually really important, the reason sleep is important and actually focusing on sleep is a good thing,” Sunderram added. But some of the tips and tricks involved in sleepmaxxing may be questionable at best and harmful at worst. Here’s what experts say you should be wary of and what actually works. Many of the practices included in sleepmaxxing focus on basic habits that experts have long touted as the holy grail for sleep health. Those tried-and-true tactics include sleeping in a cool, dark and quiet room; limiting screen time and exposure to bright lights before bed; not drinking alcohol or caffeine in the several hours before bed; and having a regular bedtime and wake time, experts said. The cool temperature — which should be anywhere between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (between 15.6 and 19.4 degrees Celsius) — is conducive to the natural cooldown your body does to prepare you for sleep, experts said. Blue light from screens and other sources can keep your brain awake and interfere with the production of melatonin, the sleep hormone. And alcohol can cause restless sleep throughout the night. Related article
      If you’re constantly tired, these health conditions could be the reasons why, experts say Having a regular bedtime helps your body know when it’s time for shut-eye, making falling asleep easier, experts said. Many sleepmaxxers turn to sleep tracking apps, which can be helpful for monitoring the various factors that support or harm your rest, experts said. But users should be careful to not get obsessed with constantly checking the app and letting its feedback negatively influence your perspective on your upcoming sleep before it happens, said Dr. Rafael Pelayo, a clinical professor in the sleep medicine division at Stanford University. Whether some apps are accurate enough in reflecting what’s truly happening during your sleep is also questionable, Sunderram said. Some people are also fans of weighted blankets, and there is some evidence supporting their use for improved sleep and feeling more rested while awake, experts said. Weighted blankets can be reassuring for people who like feeling cocooned while sleeping, Pelayo said. That pressure may even lead the body to secrete a little extra oxytocin, the love hormone humans produce when cuddling. Feeling relaxed reduces the stress hormone cortisol, which can interrupt sleep. Red light exposure is another staple in some sleepmaxxing routines, but only a few studies have found an association with improved sleep and serum melatonin levels. Others discovered red light still induced alertness during sleep, and the light’s lesser tendency to suppress melatonin when compared with blue light has likely been conflated with improving sleep, experts told CNN in a previous story. Taking supplements is also common in sleepmaxxing, particularly using melatonin and magnesium. But for most people it’s not necessary, and consistently taking these supplements to alleviate issues with falling asleep could be masking a sleep disorder in need of assessment by a professional, experts said.

      Why your phone doesn’t make for the best alarm clock Additionally, “some medical conditions can worsen with magnesium supplement use,” Shelgikar said. Another thing some sleepmaxxers are consuming is one or two kiwi before bed. It turns out that “kiwis have antioxidants and serotonin precursors, which some studies suggest may support sleep,” Shelgikar said. Some sleepmaxxers have also turned to mouth taping to stop mouth breathing, which has been linked with snoring, thirst, dry mouth, bad breath and over time, gum disease and malocclusion, a condition in which the upper and lower teeth don’t align. But experts have criticized the TikTok trend as dangerous, especially for those with obstructive sleep apnea, a complete or partial collapse of the airway. Mouth taping can also cause soft tissue damage. Some sleepmaxxers are also using nostril expanders, which can be helpful for those experiencing chronic nasal congestion or snoring, Sunderram said. But “if someone feels that difficulty with nasal breathing is impacting their sleep, they should talk with their healthcare professional,” Shelgikar said via email. Some of the sleepmaxxing fanfare has more to do with looking good rather than sleeping well — some TikTokers have filmed themselves applying multilayered beauty routines to their face and hair before bed, then doing a “morning shed” of all the products upon waking. “Different people will find different winddown approaches to be beneficial,” Shelgikar said via email. “The key is having a consistent routine and consistent sleep-wake schedule, as these approaches can help with obtaining restful sleep.” Related article
      Study expands the science on the link between sleep and dementia “Sleepmaxxing can backfire if it turns what should be a restorative process into a high-pressure chore,” Shelgikar said. “For some individuals, being overly attentive to sleep optimization and sleep patterns every night can increase stress and worsen sleep over time.” Some people can even develop orthosomnia, an unhealthy obsession with achieving perfect sleep. If you’ve been consistently practicing proper sleep health habits but are still having trouble getting an appropriate quantity or quality of sleep, talk with your doctor or a sleep specialist who can help treat your problem, experts said.",,0.20198699831962585
"If you feel like your teen is a mystery, new data may help give you a better look inside their world. While teen boys and girls are facing many of the same issues, including school pressure and mental health concerns, they may need different kinds of support, according to a Pew Research Center Survey published Thursday. “One of our main objectives with the research was trying to understand the challenges that teens are facing these days, and specifically how they’re experiencing school, and whether these things differ by gender,” said Kim Parker, Pew’s director of social trends research. “We’ve been doing a lot of work this year on men and masculinity, and part of that conversation involves what’s happening with boys and girls.” The survey was conducted September 18 through October 10 among 1,391 teens ages 13 to 17. While the data did show differences among them ­­–– such as girls reporting more of a pressure to fit in socially and look good while boys said they felt they should be strong and good at sports more often –– many of their perspectives were similar. Both girls and boys said it was highly important to find a career they enjoy, making money and cultivating friendships in the future, according to the data. “We are prone to negatively stereotyping teenagers as superficial in their interests, and these results are an excellent reminder that teenagers are serious about the schoolwork they’re doing now, and they are looking ahead to their careers,” said psychologist Dr. Lisa Damour, author of “The Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.” She was not involved in the report. Teen boys and girls alike reported they felt pressure to get good grades, according to the data. And for those who didn’t see it as an even split, both teen girls and boys perceived girls as getting better grades and being favored by teachers, the report showed. What they perceive matches existing data that shows girls on average do tend to get better grades than boys, Damour said. Related article

Here’s how to help But grades aren’t a zero-sum game –– the success of girls in school doesn’t have to mean boys do worse, said Dr. Annie Maheux, assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Winston Family Distinguished Fellow at the Winston National Center on Technology Use, Brain and Psychological Development. The disparity might be a sign that something in schooling isn’t working for boys as well as it should, noted Maheux, who wasn’t involved in the survey. “Schools are set up in such a way that kids who sit still and are less impulsive are going to do well, and we know that there’s a big difference in brain development in early adolescence, and that the part of the brain that’s used for impulse control and critical thinking develops later in boys than girls,” said Michelle Icard, a parenting educator and speaker. “We are teaching to half of the audience and need to broaden the way we approach education,” said Icard, who wasn’t involved in the report. More activity and teaching styles that incorporate hands-on learning, for example, might help teen boys do better academically, said Icard, author of “Fourteen Talks by Age Fourteen: The Essential Conversations You Need to Have With Your Kids Before They Start High School.” There is good and bad news when it comes to what teens said about their friendships. Only 2% of teens said that they didn’t have any friends, according to the Pew report. And while that number of those without friends would ideally be zero, it is lower than expected and feels positive, Icard said. Friendships are especially important in adolescent years, she added. “Teens are at an age where they’re less likely to turn to an adult for support. They’re naturally going to reach out to their peers before looking to an adult, and peers can be great ushers to adults as needed,” Icard said. “But if you don’t have someone who says, ‘Hey, this is a problem you should talk to a grown-up about,’ then that can be dangerous.” Although most boys reported they had a close friend they could turn to for support, the number was lower (85%) compared with that of girls (95%) who said they could turn to a friend for support, the data showed. “We need to try to lose the mythology that boys don’t make close relationships,” Damour said. But at the same time, “we need to take very seriously that we continue to socialize boys to feel that vulnerable emotions are unacceptable. And so long as we’re doing that, we’re going to have boys and adult men who don’t enjoy the strong social support they deserve.” There was a difference in how teen boys and girls perceived their struggles: Both said that girls were more likely to experience anxiety and depression and boys were more likely to struggle with substance abuse, fighting and class disruptions, according to the data. But those findings don’t mean that one group is experiencing mental health concerns and the other is just facing a behavioral issue, Damour said. “Under mental health, we should fold in the finding that boys are more likely to engage in physical fights,” she said. “One of our well-established understandings as clinicians is that when girls are in distress, they have been socialized to collapse in on themselves –– they’re more likely to experience anxiety and depression. When boys are in distress, they are more likely to act out and get themselves in trouble.” Related article
      Self-hatred isn’t the same as depression. A psychiatrist explains how to treat it in teens While disciplinary action might be appropriate when a teen is abusing substances or acting out, it is important that such punishment is paired with an understanding that the behavior comes from suffering, which needs to be addressed, too, Damour said. “When we see anger in a teenage boy, we think, ‘Well, that’s not depression,’ but it might be. Or if you see a boy who’s acting recklessly, you might think, ‘Oh, he’s a daredevil,’” Icard added. “That behavior is a reflection of feeling untethered to other people. So, I wouldn’t presume that boys feel less anxious and less depressed.”",,0.2494349479675293

All it took was losing $100 billion in three months to make Elon Musk change his tune on government work. ICYMI: The last 24 hours have brought a parade of humiliation for the world’s richest edgelord, starting with his $20 million losing bet on the pro-Trump candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Hours after the loss in Wisconsin, Tesla reported its biggest sales drop ever, falling 13% in the first quarter, while its No. 1 rival grew revenue by 60% in the same time period. Then came a Politico report quoting MAGA insiders who say that Musk has overstayed his welcome in Washington. The White House on Wednesday called the Politico report “garbage,” and Musk dismissed it as “fake news” in social media post. But the administration confirmed that Musk is expected to wrap up his stint as Trump’s hatchet man in late May or June, when his 130 days as a “special government employee” comes to an end. That was enough to reverse a 6% decline in Tesla shares — a sign investors are optimistic that Musk will ditch the cheese-hat shenanigans and focus on his company’s rapidly shrinking market share (and maybe, possibly, deliver on his long-delayed promises to revolutionize autonomous driving.) In short: Voters, customers, investors and the MAGA elite say the Elon Musk show has lost the plot. Musk has shed more than a quarter of his total net worth since January as Tesla shares have tanked. He remains the world’s richest person by a country mile with $323 billion — second-placer Jeff Bezos is still more than $100 billion behind. Because Musk is both the public face of Tesla and its biggest individual shareholder, when one suffers, the other suffers in kind. Musk’s alliance with the far right has torched Tesla’s brand in the eyes of what used to be the carmaker’s base: upwardly mobile eco-conscious lefties from the coasts. It was never clear how Musk planned to replace those customers with folks from red states who have long resisted EV adoption. So far, various attempts to stem the bleeding have only made things worse. A live Tesla sales pitch with Trump on the South Lawn reeked of desperation. The Commerce secretary’s urging of regular Americans to buy Tesla shares, similarly, fell flat. And the FBI threatening to prosecute Tesla vandals as domestic terrorists — a wild re-imagination of the meaning of “terrorism,” according to legal experts — only reinforced the sense of desperation around the brand. But the ultimate rebuke came from voters. Musk tried to use his virtually infinite money to influence the Wisconsin race, and even showed up in a giant cheese hat at a rally in Green Bay, during which he handed out two $1 million checks to voters in a stunt that faced an immediate legal challenge. His effort backfired, and the state court retained its 4-3 liberal majority. Bottom line: Money can buy a lot of things, but not all things. And with Tesla’s continued sales drop, Musk is getting a harsh reminder that he’s not the only one who can wield a pocketbook to send a message.",,0.3282136619091034

Business leaders are panicking. Consumers, if they’re reading the news, are rightly confused or scared or both. Economists are squinting at the Trump administration’s tariff agenda and trying to make it, somehow, make sense. Here’s a tip for anyone else who finds themselves gobsmacked: Stop trying to make it make sense. Looking for logic? You won’t find it. As we’ve written before, President Donald Trump’s stated goals for his tariff agenda are full of contradictions. Even the math the administration used to calculate “reciprocal” tariffs on trading partners is more performance art than, well, math (more on that in a moment). America’s economy is the envy of the world. Yet Trump believes it’s the victim of other nations’ unfair trade practices. Tariffs are his catch-all theory of how to level the playing field and revive American manufacturing. He is unshakable on that — even if it means pushing the US economy into a recession. He claims tariffs will hurt foreign countries, and he’s not wrong. But he has so far shrugged at the fact that tariffs will needlessly punish Americans, too. For no reason, the US government is now going to force Americans to pay more for things that we simply cannot produce domestically. Like, coffee. Certain wines. Rare earth minerals that are essential to the tech industry. Countless other things. And perhaps most quixotically, Trump seems to believe we can undo decades of globalization and bring back the manufacturing jobs we already shipped overseas. (Even if we could “reshore” those industries, it would take many, many years.) “There is no strategy,” said Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, during a Brookings Institution event Thursday. “Are we supposed to knit our own knickers?” Lovely added: “When people say they want manufacturing in the US, they’re saying high-tech, sustainable jobs” — not the lower-skilled and labor-intensive jobs that have migrated to developing economies. “I think a great exercise is everybody go home, and when you’re dressing tonight for bed, look at where your clothes are made,” Lovely said. “All of these countries have large deficits, and that gives them the high ‘reciprocal’ tariffs.” Bad math Lovely and others have made the point that if you wanted to balance out some trade deficits, there are strategic ways to do it. Maybe you’d assemble a team of leading economists and policy experts and take a scalpel to each trade agreement and figure out where you have leverage. But Trump’s government did not do painstaking dollar-for-dollar studies to try to nail down an accurate rate for each trading partner. Instead, it took a country’s trade deficit, divided it by its exports to the United States, then divided that number by two. That’s it. Related article
      Trump’s massive tariffs shake markets, spark recession fears A lot of analysts were shocked by that sledgehammer approach. “If a ninth grader in high school presented this tariff chart to a teacher in a basic economics class, the teacher would laugh and say ‘sit down and work on the assignment,’” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note on Thursday. Or, as Lovely put it: “It’s like going to your doctor, finding out you have cancer, and the basis for your medication is your weight divided by your age.” Here’s my favorite part, though: When economist and author James Surowiecki figured out the convoluted formula, the White House tried to say he was wrong and released a scary-looking equation with Greek letters to try to illustrate the very sophisticated math they used to calculate this monumental change to global economic policy. Turns out, that equation worked out to exactly what Surowiecki said it was, just dressed up with symbols that make it look more complicated — and to intimidate people who question what they’re doing, as economist Brendan Duke told me. That is not economic policy — it is Russian roulette in an economic policy costume. “Oh sh—” Since the president’s Orwellian “Liberation Day” speech, the global response hasn’t exactly been celebratory. Stocks began tumbling almost immediately, shedding trillions of dollars in market value overnight. All three major US indexes posted their biggest single-day drop since 2020. Global leaders expressed shock; and some, including allies like France and Canada, promised to retaliate. Oil fell more than 6%. Stellantis, the carmaker behind Jeep and Chrysler, is already laying off 900 American workers and pausing production at some of its Canadian and Mexican plants, citing the impact of tariffs. When the CEO of RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) saw his company’s stock fall 40% during an earnings call Wednesday evening, shortly after Trump’s speech, he uttered two words that just about summed up the thoughts of every other executive that day: “Oh, sh—.” Shares of multinational companies like Nike and Apple were hit hard, as were retailers like Five Below and Dollar Tree, which rely heavily on cheap imports from Asia. “This is the policymaking equivalent of a suicide bomber,” Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital, told my colleague Matt Egan. “They’re ignoring every rule of classic micro and macroeconomics.” So that’s the word on the Street, the institution that Trump has previously viewed as a real-time report card on his presidency. On Thursday, though, Trump shrugged off the market reaction, telling reporters: “I think it’s going very well.”",,0.2531580328941345

There are two conflicting messages coming from the White House in recent days: On Monday morning, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro penned an op-ed in the Financial Times saying that you shouldn’t hold your breath for any exemptions or deals. One chaotic trading day later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went on CNBC and said, “I think we can end up with some good deals” if countries come to the table with “solid proposals.” (Bessent isn’t the only Trump advisor butting heads with Navarro. Elon Musk on Tuesday tweeted that “Navarro is truly a moron,” because apparently we live in a country run by the Real Housewives of the West Wing.) Anyway, the White House’s apparent openness to some tariff flexibility was enough to shift the mood — for a while, anyway — on Wall Street, which, after three straight trading days of losses, was ready to go bargain shopping. Stocks opened more than 3% higher Tuesday morning. Of course, it’s important to remember that volatility in the market goes both directions. Stocks often briefly rebound in moments of great uncertainty. It’s called, in the colorful parlance of the investing world, a dead cat bounce. (The idea is even a dead cat will bounce if it falls fast enough from a great enough height. It’s also known as a sucker’s rally, because it’s usually not based on anything substantive.) Sure enough, the cat bounced. Then, to add to the animal metaphors, the bears roared back. Wall Street isn’t pleased The morning rally got completely wiped out by late afternoon as investors were slapped in the face with news that the White House would tack on an extra 50% tariff on China. For those keeping track at home, that’s 104% in new tariffs on China under Trump’s second term. (And with apologies for all the math: When you add that to the US’s existing tariffs on China, the total average tariff US imports from the world’s second-largest economy will come to nearly 125%. Considering how much stuff Americans buy from China, Wall Street was right in freaking out.) The exorbitant China tariffs are only compounding concerns about a shock to supply chains that could push the US (and possibly the world) into a recession. That anxiety isn’t helped by the fact that businesses and investors don’t know which of the various adviser opinions Trump will ultimately listen to. Here’s a smorgasbord of mixed messages from Trump aides in just the last day: And here’s what Trump said when asked about the mixed messaging Monday: “It could be, they can both be true. There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations because there are things that we need beyond tariffs.” If you’re a business owner or a banker, that’s the clear-as-mud guidance you’re living by right now. Bottom line: Corporate America seems to be praying that Bessent (a former hedge fund manager) and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (former head of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald) will be the voices of reason that prevent Trump from tanking the economy or sparking a financial panic. He’s the dealmaker president, after all — surely he’ll eventually tie a tourniquet around this self-inflicted wound. Buuuuut there’s a pretty convincing counter-argument to that, too. As The Atlantic’s Jonathan Lemire wrote Monday, rather ominously, Trump is a president emboldened by his comeback and unburdened by a reelection campaign. “He believes that launching a trade battle is his best chance of fundamentally remaking the American economy, elites and experts be damned,” Lemire wrote. “‘This man was politically dead and survived both four criminal cases and an assassination attempt to be president again. He really believes in this and is going to go big,’ one of the outside allies told (Lemire). ‘His pain threshold is high to get this done.’”",,0.2844545841217041

A fluke of social media rumor-mongering just served up the closest thing to a crystal ball as you can get on Wall Street. And for President Donald Trump, it’s a glimpse at a future where he can be the market hero. If he’s paying attention. Stocks tumbled Monday as investors around the world tried to digest just how devastating Trump’s self-inflicted tariff pain will be to the global economy. On Wall Street, major indexes opened more than 3% lower, in so-called bear-market territory — more than 20% off their most recent high just seven weeks ago. It looked like yet another day of hemorrhaging market value in response to last week’s tariff announcement. But less than an hour after the market opened, stocks abruptly reversed course, surging 8% in a matter of minutes. (Which, just to be clear, does not happen on a normal day.) Related article
      Extreme volatility sends US stocks on a roller coaster ride as Wall Street is rattled by tariffs The jolt into positive territory was short-lived — a spark of hope kindled by a bogus rumor that Trump was weighing a three-month delay on tariffs. (The unsourced headline appears to have come from a tiny account on X, though as of Monday evening it was still unclear how it ultimately ended up on a CNBC chyron.) Once traders realized there was no truth to it, they sold off once again and returned stock tickers to a sea of red. Weird. But potentially instructive, if Trump is paying attention. That fleeting moment of buying enthusiasm represented a potential off-ramp that we rarely (never?) see in a market sell-off this severe. It was Trump — not a pandemic, or a war, or the collapse of a financial house of cards — that created this mess. And with one sentence, he could undo all of it. Traders pounced on the fake headline because they are desperate for a sign — any sign — that a voice of sanity will make it into Trump’s ear. Any kind of delay would buy corporations some time to rearrange their supply chains and blunt the shock of tariffs. Even an indication that the White House is willing to negotiate with trading partners could help stem the losses. But the cavalry of sanity isn’t coming. At least not yet. And at this point, the White House is already getting blamed for the financial market losses anyway, so there’s no real point in reversing course now, Mike O’Rourke, chief markets strategist at Jones Trading, told me Monday. To its credit, the Trump administration is doing exactly what it has said it would do for months. It’s just that Wall Street didn’t expect the tariffs to be as harsh as they are, and they didn’t expect Trump to be so reckless with the stock market — the institution he once viewed as a real-time report card on his presidency. “I think it’s setting in that they’re going to follow through on this,” O’Rourke said. “And then the problem is, we’re going into earnings season, and you just have to think that every company is going to have negative comments … There’s not much you can optimistically look forward to, except the announcement of some type of trade deal that shows us a path forward.” The White House’s muddled messaging on tariffs isn’t helping manage investors’ expectations. While Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro assured news outlets over the weekend that the tariffs are happening, Trump himself on Sunday indicated he was open to negotiating and that he’d been fielding calls from tech executives and world leaders all weekend. (CNN has reported that the Trump administration is in active discussions with Israel, Vietnam and India about the possibility of bespoke trade deals.) With uncertainty emanating from DC, some on Wall Street say it’s time to send an unambiguous message to the president and his team: Don’t buy the dip. Stocks are cheaper than they were a week ago, so it’s only natural investors may take a break from the sell-off and load up on some bargain assets. But going into dip-buying mode risks rewarding Trump for playing chicken with the global economy. Like training a puppy, you sometimes need a negative correction if you want it to stop peeing on the rug. ”We need this market to crash — to keep the pressure on the administration,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told my colleague Matt Egan on Monday. Yardeni clarified to say he is not outright rooting for a crash, just that higher stock prices will ease pressure on the White House to back off the trade war. Still, that is a telling comment from an analyst as prominent as Yardeni, who also happens to have a Ph.D in economics from Yale.",,0.22658538818359375
"US stock markets fell sharply Friday after an economic report showed American consumers are growing increasingly fearful of price increases and how President Donald Trump’s tariffs could reignite the inflation crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 748 points, or 1.7%. The broader S&P 500 also sank 1.7% and the Nasdaq was 2.2% lower. The Dow tumbled for the second consecutive day, falling about 1,200 points over the course of Thursday and Friday. The University of Michigan’s latest survey, released Friday, showed that US consumer sentiment declined in February for the second consecutive month, according to a final reading, down by a steep 10% from January. That was double the decline initially reported earlier this month. The survey found that Americans are losing confidence in the economy, driven primarily by worries over Trump’s tariffs potentially jacking up prices. A new CNN poll released Thursday similarly showed pessimism on the rise because of prices: Nearly two thirds of US adults nationwide, 62%, said they feel Trump isn’t doing enough to address inflation. The Michigan survey showed that Americans are now fearful of higher inflation on the horizon. Investors grew fearful that weak consumer sentiment could lead to a pullback in Americans’ shopping habits. Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of the US economy. Although there’s no evidence that a recession is anywhere on the horizon, economic data has weakened in recent months. Job growth has fallen off over the course of the past year as employers wait to see what the Trump administration’s economic policy will bring – particularly around tariffs, which could severely dent companies’ bottom lines. Housing continues to slow down: a National Association of Realtors report Friday shows that sales of existing homes fell 4.9% in January from the previous month, while prices shot up to a record high for the month, exacerbating America’s home affordability crisis. And retail sales have dropped recently, too. Walmart warned Thursday that its sales and profit growth will slow this year – a surprise to many on Wall Street who bet that Walmart’s low prices on essentials would continue to ignite the company’s stellar growth over the past several years, even during the worst of the inflation crisis. The retailer blamed consumer fears over rising prices and tariffs for its lackluster growth forecast. That was echoed by Monday’s University of Michigan survey, which found the drama surrounding tariffs has affected Americans’ perception of prices: Expectations for inflation in the year ahead surged this month to 4.3%, according to the Michigan survey, up a full percentage point from January to the highest level since November 2023. Also dragging down stocks was UnitedHealth, a key Dow component, which sank 7% on a Wall Street Journal report that the US Department of Justice is investigating the company for its Medicaid billing practices. The company strongly denied the Journal’s report. Despite the plunge, stocks are very close to their all-time highs. The S&P 500 hit a record on Wednesday before falling back just a bit Thursday.

"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. “I guess they say it was the biggest day in financial history,” President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon. Later, in an apparent hot-mic moment, he told a fawning senator that the market was up almost seven percentage points. “Nobody’s ever heard of it. It’s gonna be a record.” It was a historic day, indeed — the third “best” day in the S&P 500’s history. After Trump announced that he was instituting a 90-day pause on most new tariffs (minus China), the Dow added 2,900 points, or nearly 8%. The S&P 500 soared almost 9.5%, its best day since 2008, and the Nasdaq had its second-best day ever, rising more than 12%. And it was all thanks to Trump — the guy whose extreme agenda (and contradictory messaging around it) became a noose around the neck of global financial markets that were about to enter a doom spiral. Wall Street’s reaction to his reversal on tariffs is not a victory lap for investors — it’s a gasp for oxygen. Asset prices remain well below where they were a week ago, before Trump announced the tariffs. The past week cost US stocks $6 trillion in value as market participants prepared for a wildly uncertain future, all while knowing the president is prone to pulling the rug out from under their feet. Trump is clearly loving the sea of green on the TV stock ticker. But it’s going to take a lot more than one day of stock gains to undo the damage — to the economy and to America’s reputation — that his policies have done. Recession risk hasn’t gone away “My sense here is that the (US) economy is still likely to fall into recession, given the level of simultaneous shocks that it’s absorbed,” Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist of consulting firm RSM, told CNN’s Alicia Wallace. “All this does is postpone temporarily what will likely be a series of punitive import taxes put on US trade allies.” Trump’s new plan is hardly a full retreat. It leaves in place some of his historic and most aggressive tariffs in place, including 10% tariffs on all virtually all imports coming into the United States and ratchets up tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. Still in place are 25% tariffs on some goods from Mexico and Canada and 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Over the next three months, the White House expects dozens of governments to try to come to the negotiating table to hammer out longer-term deals — a process that would overwhelm even the most disciplined White House, given the complexity that such trade agreements typically require. Prior to Trump’s tariff pause, RSM raised its recession odds to 55% from 20%. Brusuelas said the recession is likely to occur in next few months. That’s because businesses have already felt the supply shock and are raising prices in accordance with the White House’s promise. “Based on anecdotal discussions I’ve had with clients… many of them are going to choose just to leave the products at the docks — they don’t have the cash reserves to pay the tax,” Brusuelas said. A chorus of economists and analysts were similarly keeping the champagne on ice. “Even if the administration decides to de-escalate global trade wars and shift their focus to other policy areas, we’re still not out of the woods,” wrote Christian Hoffman, head of fixed income at Thornburg Investment Management, in an email. “Uncertainty remains exceptionally high, and our attention will move away from the president’s tweets and back to economic data to assess the damage that’s been done.” Tech investor Dan Ives said Trump’s announcement was the news “everyone on the Street was waiting for.” But he called the trade war with China “an epic debacle” that has already done real damage to the economy. Goldman Sachs economists said the chances of a recession, while slightly lower after Wednesday’s shift, are still elevated, at around 45%. Basically a coin flip. People were getting ‘yippy’ One of the yarns the White House has been spinning lately is that Trump won’t be moved by the stock market — that the tariff policy was too important to rehabbing America’s economy. But clearly, Trump’s longtime fixation on the market as a barometer of his presidency hasn’t gone away. On Monday, as stocks were tumbling, a mysterious, apparently misfired tweet about a 90-day tariff relief plan briefly turned the market around in a wild jolt. The rally only lasted a few minutes, as the White House dismissed the rumor, which ended up on a CNBC chyron, as “fake news.” But the blip offered a glimpse at what would happen if Trump did decide to put some slack into the noose, giving corporations, government leaders and investors a moment to catch their breath and make a plan. Sure enough, as the market opened Wednesday morning, Trump posted on Truth Social that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” A few hours later, his tariff plans were on hold and markets immediately turned positive. The president told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny that he decided to institute the 90-day pause because he thought “people were jumping a little bit out of line — they were getting yippy.” “I was watching the bond market,” Trump said. “The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it’s beautiful.” Of all the financial warning signs plaguing traders over the past week, the bond market’s behavior was by far the scariest. ‘The bond market spooked the president’ In normal times, stocks and bonds don’t fall simultaneously. When investors are nervous, they tend to put their money into safe havens like US Treasury bonds, which causes bond prices to go up. That has not been happening. Instead, investors around the world have been offloading stocks and bonds at the same time, causing stock prices to fall and bond yields (which move inversely to prices) to shoot higher. That’s a huge red flag, for a variety of reasons. It could mean investors are questioning the US government’s long-term stability. It could also mean investors who lost a ton of money in the market are under pressure to shore up cash to cover their positions. Or it could be a sign that of what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a former hedge funder, called “deleveraging convulsions” — essentially, an unwinding of a popular arbitrage strategy known as a “basis trade” that relies on using loads of borrowed money to buy Treasury bonds. Whatever the cause, this bond market distress signal has only gone off a handful of times in history — the most recent being 2020 and 2008. (Remember what happened then?) “The bond market spooked the president,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN’s Matt Egan. “Bond vigilantes were screaming that they weren’t happy with what was going on and there was a potential for a recession.”",,0.27271831035614014
"Seth Rogen may be playing a high-powered Hollywood studio executive in his latest project, but he will never forget his roots. The “Superbad” actor and comedian was just a teenager when his first-ever TV series “Freaks and Geeks” never made it past its first season, giving him his first true taste of how quickly luck can change according to the whims of the Hollywood machine. “My first experience in all of Hollywood was making something great (“Freaks and Geeks”) that no one wanted and was instantly canceled, so that was a good tone setter,” Rogen jokingly told Esquire magazine in a new interview published Tuesday. The 1999-2000 series has since become a beloved cult classic. It starred Rogen, James Franco, Linda Cardellini, Jason Segel, Busy Philipps and Martin Starr, among others, and followed a group of misfit high school students who have big dreams and even bigger bullies to contend with. Despite the show lasting only one season before its cancellation, Rogen said the experience still taught him a lesson he carries today. “You can do everything right and still fail,” he said. “You can do the best work there is, and it doesn’t mean anyone’s going to watch it.” In an upcoming project, the “Knocked Up” star is playing a character drastically different from his “Freaks and Geeks” character Ken Miller, who Rogen believes that 25 years later is probably now just “a statistic, unfortunately.” Rogen plays the head of a movie studio in AppleTV+’s new comedy “The Studio,” who he says “really loves movies but is afraid he is going to make them worse.” “The Studio” follows Matt Remick (Rogen), who is the newly appointed head of a fictional movie studio that is desperate for the approval of celebrities and has to juggle corporate demands with creative ambitions to get movies onto the big screen.

"The “SNL50: The Anniversary Special” was a walk down memory lane for viewers of the long-running NBC sketch show. Classic characters, like Mike Myers as Linda Richman, were mixed in with newer hit sketches like Marcello Hernández’s suave Domingo, who introduced us to his “hot brothers,” for a rousing good time. While it would have been impossible to cover all the bases (we miss you Chris Kattan/Mr. Peepers!), there are some inarguably classic sketches and characters that would have been great to see represented during the celebration. A nostalgic list of some of them follows: “Wayne’s World”Myers and Dana Carvey reunited for a “Wayne’s World” sketch for SNL’s 40th anniversary, so maybe they didn’t want to repeat the move just ten years later. That said, doing so would have really been a “party on” moment. “Target Lady”Kristen Wiig is known for many things, but her “Target Lady” reigns as one of her most popular “SNL” characters. Though the anniversary special was jam-packed, we certainly missed Wiig’s Target Lady saying super weird stuff to customers at checkout. “The Californians”Sure, we got this recent fun commercial for Volkswagen featuring the famed “Californians” trio of Wiig, Bill Hader and Fred Armisen, but it sadly was not part of Sunday’s show. We’re chalking this up to Hader not being present for the special. (A representative for Hader previously told CNN the actor had a schedule conflict.) “Church Lady”Dana Carvey was present for most of this “SNL” season playing former US President Joe Biden but he did not show up on the air on Sunday’s anniversary special, except for a brief moment in a photo during a Black Jeopardy sketch. This means we didn’t get to see his sassy, politically-charged Church Lady. It would have been so very “special.” “Whiskers R We”Another classic was Wiig’s collaboration with Kate McKinnon for their “Whiskers R We” characters. Barbarba DeDrew and Furonica – “like Veronica, but how a cat would say it” – were the pun-loving feline fans who wanted to help get some cats adopted and were also in love with each other. Perhaps bringing live animals out during the anniversary special would’ve been too chaotic so, we get it. “NPR’s Delicious Dish”This felt like the perfect opportunity to bring on Margaret Jo McCullin and Terry Rialto, played by Ana Gastyer and Molly Shannon, respectively, for another gleefully boring episode of “NPR’s Delicious Dish.” Considering Alec Baldwin was also in the house, we’re disappointed that he, as Pete Schweddy, didn’t bring everyone a box of his Schweddy Balls. “Spartan Cheerleaders”“SNL” fan-favorite Cheri Oteri appeared to be absent on Sunday, but she was missed. How fun would it have been to see her and Will Ferrell reprise their famed Spartan Cheerleader characters Craig and Arianna? We’re betting they’d be proud to show off some new moves. “Gumby”While we were thrilled to see Eddie Murphy back on Studio 8H, we were a little saddened that he didn’t take things way back and do an updated rendition of his take on Gumby. Sure, we last saw the rich piece of gum just a few years ago, but there’s plenty of new things for him to be angry about these days.",,0.2776561379432678
"Mindy Kaling is known for many things, but according to her longtime friend and “Office” costar B.J. Novak, she especially loves being known for, well, being well known. Kaling was honored on Tuesday when she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where Novak made a heartfelt speech that also poked fun at Kaling’s love of being famous, even if it’s a “weird” part of the job that she never really signed up for. “Mindy respects and understands this in a very intuitive way,” Novak joked. “Because in addition to being a brilliant and wildly successful showrunner, an incredible mother-of-three, a deep and caring daughter and friend and mentor to so many, Mindy is also, in her spare time, I assure you, very superficial.” Novak continued to genuinely say that he and Kaling’s loved ones always knew she’d be famous, “but we had no idea how beautifully you’d handle the job.” Later, Kaling thanked Novak when she made her speech, saying that he is “such an important and integral part of my family that sometimes I forget the reason that I know him is because we work together professionally.” “I’m as starstruck by him now at age 29 as I was when I first met you, at (age) 24,” Kaling joked. “I love you.” (Kaling and Novak are both in fact 45.) Kaling is best known for playing Kelly Kapoor on NBC’s “The Office” between 2005 and 2013. She also served as a writer and an executive producer on the series until its final season aired. The Emmy-nominee went on to star in, write and produce “The Mindy Project” on NBC and is a writer and producer on HBO’s “Sex Lives of College Girls.” She has also starred in dozens of films including “Late Night,” “A Wrinkle in Time” and “Ocean’s 8.” Hilariously, Kaling proved Novak’s point during her Walk of Fame speech when she declared that “this is one of the times where I’m just gonna force myself to be in the moment.” “I’m so happy,” she said, with a smile. “I love recognition and this is just incredibly nice.”",,0.3101712763309479
"One of the most famous stages in New York was the place to be on Sunday night. Alums, former hosts and seemingly everyone who’s ever entered “SNL’s” orbit was on hand to celebrate the show’s 50th Anniversary. “SNL50: The Anniversary Special” was part reflection, part reunion and a culmination of festivities that began on Friday with a concert. Here are some highlights: Returning characters What would an “SNL” special be without the favorites? Kristen Wiig’s Dooneese, Will Ferrell’s Robert Goulet, Molly Shannon’s Sally O’Malley, Pete Davidson’s Chad, Rachel Dratch’s Debbie Downer, Cecily Strong’s the Girl You Wish You Hadn’t Started a Conversation With at a Party and Bobby Moynihan’s Drunk Uncle were among the characters who returned with largely positive results. What would a trip town memory lane be without Debbie pouring drinks and reminding us of the dangers of alcohol and microplastics? An ‘SNL’ talk-show crossover An inarguable highlight of the familiar fictional faces was the “SNL” talk-show crossover, which featured Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph’s “Bronx Beat” having a moment with Mike Myers in character as Linda Richman from “Coffee Talk.” With a guest list as packed as the one for Sunday’s special, it felt natural to have these characters make the most of a once-in-a-lifetime chance to come together. Meryl Streep makes her “SNL” debut Kate McKinnon’s chain-smoking Colleen Rafferty, a woman who was abducted by aliens, was also among the returning characters, but this time, she was joined Meryl Streep, who chose to make her “SNL” debut on a very special night. The sketch, in which McKinnon appeared alongside Pedro Pascal, Woody Harrelson, Aidy Bryant and Jon Hamm, took the lore of Colleen one step further by introducing her mom, who was as hilariously raunchy as her daughter. “A good mother can also be a bad girl,” Streep, in character, suggestively joked to Pascal. Adam Sandler’s heartfelt musical tribute “SNL’s” musical history was honored in an excellent special produced by Questlove, so many of the musical moments during Sunday’s special felt oddly less memorable, with the exception of Paul McCartney. In fact, perhaps one of the most memorably musical moments came from Adam Sandler. Sandler was not among the billed musical performers but nonetheless whipped out his guitar for a song that in equal measure honored some of the longtime crew members, delivered a poignant trip down memory lane and joked about nepo babies. ‘SNL’ acknowledges it didn’t get everything right Pre-taped segments included a tribute to the show’s history of physical comedy, a digital short led by Andy Samberg about the anxieties of working on “SNL” and a look back at the shows satirical ads, including “Colon Blow” cereal and “Mom Jeans.” One of the best, however, was a highlight reel that revisited sketches and characters that have aged poorly. Tom Hanks, who introduced the latter video segment, joked that while some of the characters, accents and “ethnic wigs” featured in the past “were unquestionably in poor taste, you all laughed at them.” “So if anyone should be cancelled, shouldn’t it be you, the audience,” he joked. The legends cement their legacies It was inevitable that the faces of beloved late cast members would be featured on Sunday. John Belushi, Chris Farley, Norm MacDonald, Gilda Radner, Phil Hartman and more appeared many times in compilations and highlight reels. What can’t be forgotten, however, was that the stage was also graced by countless living “SNL” legends. One of them was Steve Martin, who had the honor of doing a timelessly funny opening monologue.

      Sabrina Carpenter joins Domingo for ‘SNL’ 50th anniversary special Martin, who has hosted the show 16 times, said that at 79 years old, he feels “like I’m 65, which is also not good.” He joked that when he heard “SNL” would be having a special to celebrate its milestone 50th year, he wanted to “leap with joy” but didn’t at the time because “I was wearing a short skirt with no underpants.” Martin was briefly joined on stage by Martin Short and John Mulaney, the latter of whom joked that, “It amazes me that 894 people have hosted ‘Saturday Night Live’ in the course of 50 years and only two of them have committed murder.” To see the likes of Poehler, Martin, Ferrell, Rudolph, Wiig, McKinnon, Myers, Shannon, Strong and more playing again on the stage in Studio 8H was nothing short of, as the night’s festivities were fittingly billed, special.",,0.25105494260787964
"An unemployed Oregonian, a divorced mother of three, a freshman college student, the governor of South Dakota and an 80-year-old grandmother from New Orleans all wanted the same thing: to host “Saturday Night Live.” On November 19, 1977, the five finalists of the show’s first — and, ultimately, only — Anyone Can Host contest took the stage in Studio 8H alongside the evening’s host, actor and screenwriter Buck Henry, and introduced themselves to America. They were vying for a chance to guest host the Christmas episode two weeks later. Henry joked that two-thirds of the 150,000 entries the show had received had to be burned “for obscenity and weirdness.” In the end, the public voted via snail mail for a person who embodied perhaps the exact opposite of both — Miskel Spillman, an elderly widow whose first plane ride ever brought her to New York City to stand beside her fellow finalists. As “SNL” turns 50, the tale of the show’s most unlikely presenter and the only non-public figure to ever take on the task is incontrovertible proof that – despite the contest’s name – not just anybody can host the Saturday night show. A ‘cheap thrill’ Spillman’s contest entry was a punchy pitch that abided by the 25-word count limit in the rules: “I’m 80 years old. I need one more cheap thrill since my doctor told me I only have another 25 years left.” She told the Associated Press at the time that her message was inspired by her frequent declaration that she would live until 105. (According to online records, she died roughly ten years shy of her goal.) Spillman seemingly didn’t mind poking fun at her age, hitting the comedic beat again in the November episode that featured the finalists. Each contestant had a moment to introduce themselves in the cold open, and she kept hers simple: “I’m Miskel Spillman. I’m old.” The in-studio audience howled. Later, she showed some softer edges. “I love everyone in the cast,” she told Henry when asked why she entered the contest. “I watch it every Saturday night, and I thought, as I am 80 years old, I want a lot of old old people all over the world to watch it and get the thrill that I have every Saturday night watching it.” Perhaps realizing he was speaking to the favorite, Buck punctuated her pitch: “You heard it from Mrs. Spillman: She wants to thrill those 80-year-olds.” It’s clear she was excited, too. But Spillman’s family was split on her decision to pursue a brief national television career. Her son, Otis, told the Associated Press that he was worried hosting “would be too much for her,” according to an article published in the Lake Charle American Press that year. Her daughter, Mary Jane, disagreed. “She’s in good health and good spirits. And she has more nerve than I have.” Spillman received support from the public in droves, garnering a roughly 15,000-vote lead over the second place finalist, according to an article featured in the Las Vegas Sun before her debut. Voting viewers saw her as a breath of fresh air, an octogenarian inspiration and even a bridge-builder. Mailed in votes included in a scrapbook made for Spillman, later sold via online auction and shared on Reddit, show that the staff of a senior services department in Atlanta collected 56 votes from employees and clients and sent them to “SNL” along with a letter of endorsement. “Since we are an agency funded to serve older persons, we feel very strongly that she should host the Christmas Program and we give her our full support,” they wrote. A woman from Arizona wrote: “I am meeting more and more 50 or older people who no longer frown on long hair, marajuana (sic) and peace. It’s heart warming.” Spillman’s victory was no surprise to the other contestants, according to Connie Crawford, the Vassar freshman who was one of the five finalists. “We all knew she was going to win,” Crawford, now a professor of acting and directing at Brown University, recalled to CNN. “How could she not? She was so sweet, she was so endearing and there was no way anyone else was going to win.” Crawford said she’s never watched the episode in which she made brief appearances. She wants to keep the memory untarnished and remember instead “the way it felt.” Among her treasured memories of the experience is meeting Spillman. “She was just a shining gem to everybody because she was clearly having fun, a great sport, smiling,” she said. “Obviously, she was old, and people were kind of taking care of her. But you could just tell people loved having her there.” ‘They couldn’t have been nicer’ Spillman, one of only two hosts in the show’s history who was born in the 1800s, presided over the eighth episode of “SNL’s” third season. She was paid the same as other hosts at the time – $3,000 – and put up in the Marriott Essex House overlooking Central Park, according to articles published at the time. Her episode took place amid a true golden moment as far as casts go — John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman and Garrett Morris. In one sketch, Spillman played Sharon, the elderly girlfriend of Jeff, a college student played by Belushi, who takes her home to meet his parents. Their age gap is not mentioned. The laughs hinge on the couple trying to convince Jeff’s parents to let them stay in the same bedroom. It was the ’70s. Spillman was accompanied to New York City by her 23-year-old granddaughter, Janine Baker, who joined her on the iconic stage at the end of the episode, when Spillman celebrated the experience. “I want to thank everyone in the world for voting for me. I’ve had the most wonderful time I’ve ever had in my life,” she said. CNN’s attempts to locate direct survivors of Spillman were unsuccessful. Spillman further reflected on her experience in a 1984 conversation with newspaper columnist Bob Greene, who interviewed her after she was one of only a handful of readers who responded to a trivia question he posed in an article. The question was: “Who is Miskel Spillman?” She told Greene that hosting was the most “thrilling” thing that ever happened to her. “It wasn’t just the idea of being on TV in front of the whole country. It was the way that the cast treated me. They couldn’t have been nicer,” Spillman, then 87, told him, according to an article published in the Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph on October 25, 1984. Murray and Radner were especially kind, she said. One night during rehearsals, they invited Spillman and her granddaughter to go to dinner and took them to a restaurant where they “talked and ate and drank the night away,” Spillman recalled. People kept coming over to get autographs from their famous dining companions, “and Bill and Gilda would introduce me to every person,” Spillman said. “We sat there and talked until 4 o’clock in the morning. I couldn’t believe it,” she said. Murray couldn’t be reached for comment by CNN. Spillman added that she and Radner had continued to exchange letters, saying “Isn’t that something, that after all this time she’d still want to write to me?” She still watched the show but admitted that she didn’t like it as much. “I suppose a lot of people feel that way,” the column quoted her. “But sometimes it amazes me. I’ll be sitting there watching ‘Saturday Night Live’ and I’ll think to myself: My goodness, I was once the host of that show.” After Spillman hosted, Greene wrote, “she became an instant national celebrity. But, the nature of fame being what it is, seven years later most people have forgotten her.” However true that was in the pre-Internet era, the episode was notable for a reason unrelated to Spillman. Elvis Costello was the musical guest that week, and it would turn out to be his last appearance for more than a decade because he was banned for changing his song choice during the live show. There was no way for Spillman to know that nearly 47 years later, she’d be part of a celebrity-packed television legacy like no other. At the time, she told Greene, she was simply “tickled to see my name in your column.” “Most people don’t remember me,” she said. What we know now is that there’s no such thing as forgotten once you’ve gone live from New York on Saturday night.",,0.2708205282688141
"“Gossip Girl” star Leighton Meester has signed on to join the cast of “Nobody Wants This” for its upcoming second season. Netflix announced the news on the streamer’s official Instagram page on Thursday, writing, “everybody wants this!” Meester, who is married to the hit rom-com’s leading man Adam Brody, will be playing the former “middle school nemesis” of Kristen Bell’s character Joanne, according to Neftlix. Variety reported that Miles Fowler of “Bottoms” fame is also tapped to guest star on Season 2, playing a character that’s on Noah’s (Brody) basketball team – known as the Matzah Ballers – who gets set up with Joanne’s sister Morgan (Justine Lupe). “Nobody Wants This” stars Brody, Bell, Jackie Tohn, Lupe and Timothy Simons. It follows Noah, a so-called “hot rabbi,” who gets into a relationship with Joanne, a sex-forward podcaster of no particular religious affiliation. Noah’s religious beliefs and traditional family presented some roadblocks for their relationship in the first season, but the pair’s undeniable chemistry kept things going. Earlier this month, Brody won a Critics Choice award for his performance in the series, and gave Meester a heartfelt mention in his speech. “My darling, darling, darling wife, Leighton, thank you,” Brody said. “Thank you for sharing this life with me and this journey with me. Thank you for our family. Love you with all my heart.” “Nobody Wants This” was an instant hit when it debuted last year. It has since nabbed three Golden Globe nods, including in the acting categories for Brody and Bell. Brody and Bell are also both nominated for SAG Awards, which Bell is also hosting and which will be held this Sunday in Los Angeles. A release date for Season 2 of “Nobody Wants This” has not yet been announced.",,0.34605589509010315
"Editor’s Note: This story recaps major plot points from the Season 3 finale of “The White Lotus.” After the surprising and truly fateful finale of Season 3 of “The White Lotus” on Sunday, Aimee Lou Wood had some takeaways that underscore all the feels that viewers are sure to be having amongst themselves and over social media for some time. At a cast panel immediately following a screening of the finale, a stricken-looking Wood – who had just watched the episode in which her character Chelsea dies in the crossfire between her love Rick (Walton Goggins) and hotel security – remarked on how “there was a lot of hope in it” in spite of the tragic end to her storyline. “Do you know what I loved about that last episode?” Wood said. “There was a lot of hope in it. There was a lot of softness.” Wood added that that feeling came from “all the connections” that are made and ratified at the season’s conclusion, specifically the ones between the three girlfriends, as well as the Ratliff family. “I found it incredibly uncynical, especially for ‘The White Lotus,’” Wood remarked. “It was very, very, very moving.” And yet, of course, she also addressed the emotional weight of Chelsea’s tragic ending. “Obviously, being the one that dies, this whole time I’ve been like, ‘So sad, Mike (White) kills hope. Because Chelsea is hope, and he kills her.’” “And it’s like, yeah, but then what I saw just then was like, there was so much love in it!” she added. “That’s why it’s so much more painful, because you have to hold it all at the same time.” Wood concluded by saying that dichotomy “is life, isn’t it? Just love and pain all the time.” Goggins was not present at the panel, but he echoed his onscreen love interest’s feelings in a heartfelt Instagram post on Sunday night, timed close to the airing of “The White Lotus” finale. “Rick + Chelsea. With the heaviest of hearts… To me, ours was a love story,” he wrote alongside a beautiful carousel of pictures showing the pair on location in Thailand. “It was only ever a love story, hindered by unresolved, childhood trauma. We all have them… but can we move past them. In the depths of our despair there is always beauty around us.” Later in the post, Goggins thanked Wood “for being my partner… a journey I will never forget.”",,0.2610147297382355
"As we continue to settle in to the luxurious and twisty experience that is another season of “The White Lotus,” there’s one character worth talking about who doesn’t even appear on screen: Mike White, the auteur who has singlehandedly written and directed all three seasons of the endlessly meme-ified series. White is a prolific fixture in Hollywood, responsible for creating some other well-known and adored titles in addition to “Lotus.” But that’s not all there is to know about him: He’s an Emmy-winning writer/director who’s been active for over 25 years While his first credits are as an actor (see below), White began writing in Hollywood in the mid-to-late ’90s, scoring a co-screenwriting credit on the 1998 teenybopper comedy “Dead Man on Campus,” followed by episodes of the similarly teen-centric TV show “Dawson’s Creek.” But it was the movie “Chuck & Buck” – a dark fable he wrote exploring themes of stalking, friendship and sexuality – that really established White. He went on to pen memorable movies including “Orange County,” “School of Rock” and “The Good Girl,” among others. He also wrote episodes for the influential TV show “Freaks and Geeks,” which helped pave the way for his 2011 HBO series “Enlightened,” a fan-adored dramatic comedy starring Laura Dern. That Emmy-nominated and intentionally cringeworthy show in turn provided White with the experience and cred to embark on his multi-season opus “The White Lotus.” He’s also a gifted actor, appearing mostly in his own work For those who’ve noticed White making the press rounds for “Lotus” and are wondering where they’ve seen his face before, it’s because he’s enjoyed an acting career alongside his other pursuits. Most recognize him from “School of Rock” – the 2003 film that White wrote about a substitute teacher (Jack Black) who turns his class into a rock band. White plays Ned Schneebly, Black’s best friend and roommate, in that movie. Others will know him from “Enlightened,” where he portrayed Tyler, one of the socially awkward coworkers that Dern’s character befriends. While he most often appears in titles he has also written, White also acted in “The Stepford Wives” reboot, as well as an episode of “Pushing Daisies,” among other titles. White often works with the same talent It’s clear to see that White loves working with a specific group of people, as certain faces keep coming up again and again in his work. One is Jack Black, who first worked with White on “Orange County,” and went on to headline “Rock” the year after. The pair later teamed up again on 2006’s “Nacho Libre” and have collaborated on additional projects since. Two other Mike White regulars are Dern and Molly Shannon, who both appeared in the 2007 film “Year of the Dog,” which White wrote and directed. “Enlightened” reunited the trio again – with Shannon playing a recurring role in the second season – and they also have both returned for “Lotus.” (Dern contributed a voice role in Season 2). White also has famously brought back three actors over the course of “The White Lotus” – namely Jennifer Coolidge, Natasha Rothwell and Jon Gries – but as it’s an anthology, most of the cast for each season does not transfer over. White is ALSO a competitive reality star The most trivia-worthy factoid about White is his surprisingly illustrious background as a reality star. The Hollywood heavyweight is known for having competed alongside his father Mel on two seasons of “The Amazing Race,” and he also made it to the final three on the 37th season of “Survivor.” On the first episode of his season of “Survivor,” White said that while many in Hollywood harbor the dream of winning Oscars, his lifelong dream was to be on “Survivor,” a show he said he was a superfan of. “Survivor” fan or not, we’re glad he got that out of his system and stuck with his day job.",,0.41052594780921936
"Dame Helen Mirren is known for her regal screen presence, having won an Oscar for playing Elizabeth II in 2006’s “The Queen,” just one of her celebrated portrayals of royalty or nobility. It would seem as something of a departure, then, to see her in the new thriller crime series “MobLand” – where she plays Maeve, the scheming and martini-swilling matriarch of a powerful London crime dynasty opposite Pierce Brosnan. But Mirren thinks Maeve fits quite well into her esteemed repertoire. “I think of all the characters I’ve played, the closest I’ve come to playing a character like Maeve was playing Lady Macbeth in a Scottish play many years ago,” Mirren said in a recent interview with CNN. “She has a lot of those qualities: profoundly ambitious, and ruthless, absolutely ruthless.” “I guess Elizabeth I (who she portrayed in the Emmy-winning 2005 miniseries), and probably Catherine the Great of Russia (who she played in a 2019 miniseries) may be sort of similar, but they were more restricted by their culture and their station,” Mirren added. Co-directed by Guy Ritchie, “MobLand” features Tom Hardy – who, along with Brosnan, was a major reason for Mirren to become involved – as the “fixer” for the Harrigan family, cleaning up their many messes. Mirren thoroughly enjoyed working on the show, which she called “a dark soap opera.” Her character calls the shots, drink in hand, and knows the score before everybody else. Mirren isn’t interested in the power play only, however. “What makes a character actually interesting is not their power, it’s their vulnerability,” she shared, going on to openly wonder what, if any, vulnerability Maeve might exhibit. “She’s a villain in a piece about villains. It will be interesting to see, ultimately hopefully, where Maeve goes.” As for whether Mirren would consider taking on any royal roles again in the future, she said “never say never, but it’s unlikely. I feel I’ve done all the really interesting ones.” (Another standout: her portrayal of Queen Charlotte in 1994’s “The Madness of King George.”) “If something pops up that is really extremely different from what I’ve just done, then I’ll go for it,” she shared about her process of selecting roles. “And if something pops up, it might be great, but it’s very similar to something I’ve just done, I’ll usually step away from it.” “Because I just love to constantly be upsetting my own cart, you know, and make life difficult for myself,” Mirren added with a queenly smile. “MobLand” premieres Sunday, March 30 on Paramount+.",,0.37092021107673645
"“Saturday Night Live” cast member Sarah Sherman has reached out to Aimee Lou Wood after impersonating the “White Lotus” star on last weekend’s episode of the long-running sketch show. Sherman spoofed Wood’s “Lotus” character Chelsea in a now-controversial sketch called “White POTUS,” which Wood publicly responded to on her Instagram Story earlier this week when she called the skit “mean and unfunny.” Wood shared a photo of a floral bouquet on her Instagram Story Tuesday, thanking Sherman for the “beautiful flowers” in text written across the photo. Following the sketch, Wood clarified via her Instagram Story that she wasn’t placing any blame on Sherman, writing “not hating on her, hating on the concept,” and continued to write that she thought “there must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way” to poke fun at the show. “White POTUS” was a pre-taped sketch that featured several current and former “SNL” cast members impersonating President Donald Trump, his family and other cabinet members on vacation in Thailand – the setting of “White Lotus” Season 3 – in situations akin to the hit series. Wood, whose natural smile has been a point of attention since the latest season of “Lotus” began airing, seemingly took issue with the part of the “White POTUS” sketch that featured Jon Hamm, the episode’s host, as Robert F. Kennedy. Hamm’s RFK wondered out loud what taking all the fluoride out of the drinking water would “do to people’s teeth” and Sherman, sporting a set of fake teeth that included a prominent overbite in the sketch, responded saying, “Fluoride, what’s that?” On her Instagram Story at the time, Wood wrote that while she is “not thin-skinned” and enjoys humor when “it’s clever and in good spirits,” she felt that “the rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on.” Wood shared on social media that she has since received “thousands” of messages in support of her speaking up about how she was portrayed, including receiving “apologies” from “SNL,” without specifying who from the show reached out to her.",,0.27803581953048706
"All we had to do was believe. AppleTV+ announced on Friday that the streamer’s Emmy-winning comedy “Ted Lasso” is set to make its much-dreamt-about return with Season 4. Jason Sudeikis, who serves as the titular character as well as an executive producer and co-show developer, will return to Richmond to reprise his role as the lovable UK-based football coach, according to a news release. “As we all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ‘look before we leap, in season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be,” Sudeikis said in a rather Lasso-like statement on Friday. The full cast roster has yet to be announced, including whether beloved “Lasso” cast members Hannah Waddingham, Juno Temple, Phil Dunster, Jeremy Swift and Nick Mohammed, among others, will reprise their roles. AppleTV+ did however confirm in the news release that Brendan Hunt and Brett Goldstein will return as executive producers, with Goldstein also continuing to serve as a cowriter on the series. The release did not specify whether they will also return as cast members Beard and Roy Kent, respectively. Also on Friday, Sudeikis guested on the New Heights podcast hosted by Jason and Travis Kelce, where he teased a plot point for Season 4, saying that his titular character will be coaching a women’s team. The news comes almost two years after the Season 3 finale episode of “Ted Lasso” aired. The episode at the time felt like a punctuation mark on the show, in spite of it not being officially billed as a “series finale,” leaving the show’s future ambiguous. “Ted Lasso” debuted in 2020 and instantly became a hit, eventually becoming one of AppleTV+’s most-streamed shows. The comedy follows Lasso, an American college football coach who moves across the pond to serve as the coach of AFC Richmond, an English football team trying to come back from relegation. Lasso may not be the most skilled coach at UK football but, along the way, he injects his optimistic credos and sentimentality around every turn. The feel-good show won 13 Emmys, including outstanding comedy series and lead actor for Sudeikis. A release date for Season 4 has not yet been announced.",,0.34940633177757263
"Tina Fey has been floated as a possibility to one day take the reins from “Saturday Night Live” creator and longtime overseer Lorne Michaels – but she’s apparently not so sure. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published on Wednesday, Fey shared her thoughts on her former boss’s seeming endorsement of her, when he said in January 2024 that she “could easily” replace him on the long-running NBC comedy sketch show. “It was nice of him to say that, and I love him very much,” Fey told the publication. “He’s irreplaceable.” Michaels, 80, has been in the driver’s seat of “SNL” since its inception in 1975, taking only one break as producer between 1980 and 1985. Naturally, speculation has long abounded as to who might replace him at “SNL” when the time comes. “His set of gifts and skills are entirely unique,” Fey added. “His eye for talent! He’s one of the last three people in show business who actually understand everything. I’ll leave it at that.” Fey has been involved with “SNL” as either a writer, “Weekend Update” anchor and/or cast member since as early as 1997, and has gone on to create and star in another NBC hit about the building in which “SNL” takes place, “30 Rock” – on which Michaels served as an executive producer. Michaels and Fey have also spent time collaborating as co-executive producers on iconic movies including 2004’s original “Mean Girls” and last year’s musical reboot of that movie. Michaels, who has since made clear that he has no intention to retire anytime soon, added of Fey in 2024, “she’s a very important person in my life,” also saying she is “brilliant and great at everything.” “SNL” is currently in its landmark 50th season, and airs on NBC on Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET/8:30 p.m. PT.

"Themes like job loss, death, aging, family dysfunction and generational divide may not sound like comedy material, but the Emmy-winning series “Hacks” manages to find the laughs around life’s roadblocks. Ahead of the Season 4 premiere next week, star Jean Smart – who plays feisty comedienne-turned-late night host Deborah Vance on the series – talked about how that dichotomy is drawn from real life at a recent press conference. “We’ve all had that in our own lives. You know, tragedy and comedy. I mean, that’s just what life is,” she shared, emphasizing the value of being able “to do that and to still have the tone of the show be essentially kind of fun and joyous.” “But then the reality of, there’s always the flip side of the coin,” she added. The cast and crew of “Hacks” were in production on Season 1 during the Covid pandemic, they navigated the dual strikes that hobbled Hollywood in 2023, and faced the wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles earlier this year. “I think we have been through a lot together,” the show’s co-creator and costar Paul W. Downs said, pointing out that “Hacks” is “a show that was made pre-vaccine.” “We started out wearing two masks and a shield, and being six feet away from each other. And I think it’s kind of like we’re forged in fire,” he continued. “And I feel like what we’ve experienced as a family, as ‘Hacks’ family, has just made us closer. It’s just made the work better.” “I think every film and television show, they say is a miracle, and it’s true,” Downs added. “It takes a huge community of people. But I think, weirdly, when you’re on a show or you’re on a set where you do have all of these hurdles, and you can see them tangibly, it just bonds you and brings you closer together.” Downs plays Deborah and Ava’s overwhelmed agent Jimmy in “Hacks.” Offscreen, he is married to series co-creator Lucia Aniello. (Jen Statsky is the third co-creator and writer on the series). “Comedy and tragedy exists sometimes simultaneously in life,” Downs said. “It weirdly has reflected, I think, the tone of the show, the things we’ve gone through because we’re making a comedy, but we’ve been through, you know, pandemics and fires and deaths and all kinds of things.” Wildfires are referenced in Season 4, which sees Deborah and company relocate from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in order for her to start hosting her late-night show. After an episode titled “I Love LA,” a title card appears in tribute to the filming location used for Deborah’s LA abode, a pink mansion built around 1930, according to Smart, that was destroyed in this year’s fires. “It’s been sitting there and hasn’t been touched by fire in 100 years almost. And it burned. And it was really sad,” Smart shared. “We had just, just finished shooting there, I think the week before or something? And to envision those beautiful rooms and that beautiful fountain and the back, the yard and the couple that lived there and their dog – I mean, they’re safe, thank God – but yeah, that was shocking.” Einbinder highlighted how these experiences have brought the show team closer, some of whom she said have known each other since high school. “We have a crew that is such a cohesive group. And every department is so close and there’s so much love,” she said. “We have, as a collective – beyond just us on the stage – we have as a collective come together and really gotten close in a way that I am told is not really the industry standard, frankly.” “Like we all really go through it side by side. It’s really, really special to be a part of it,” she later added. “Tragedy, in the good times, throughout everything. Like we really have something special.” ﻿Smart echoed the sentiment. “I think that the crew is as proud of the show as we are, even though they don’t get the accolades and the attention and the acknowledgment,” she observed. “The fact that they virtually – almost to a man – come back every season because they like being on our show is really heartwarming, flattering.” Season 4 of “Hacks” premieres on Max on April 10 at 6:00 p.m. PT/9:00 p.m. ET. Max, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.",,0.29999440908432007
"Gene Hackman, the unpretentious actor whose performances in such films as “The French Connection,” “Hoosiers,” “Unforgiven” and “The Firm” elevated character roles to leading-man levels, has died. He was 95. Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead in their home in New Mexico along with their dog, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office. Hackman’s best roles were often of conflicted authority figures or surprisingly clever white-collar villains. Many held a hint – sometimes more than a hint – of menace. He won an Oscar for his portrayal of New York cop Popeye Doyle in 1971’s “The French Connection,” a detective who gets his man but at a high cost. His surveillance expert in 1974’s “The Conversation” is single-minded to the point of obsession, losing all perspective. Even in 1986’s “Hoosiers,” in which Hackman played perhaps his most heroic role – a small-town high school basketball coach – he seems to revel in the man’s flaws. Yet he was always watchable, even magnetic. His cackle alone, which film critic David Edelstein described as “that familiar, slightly sinister ‘heh-heh-heh,’” inspired a YouTube tribute. “On one hand, he has the gravitas of the Lincoln Memorial. On the other hand, he has the physical forgettability of that middle-management guy in the seat next to you on the flight from Rochester to Omaha,” wrote Michael Hainey in a 2011 GQ article. “I’d like to think that if an actor was playing me, that he would do me in an honest fashion. I always try to approach the work in that way, regardless of how good or bad the script,” he told GQ. Perhaps it was his status as a late bloomer that made Hackman so conscious of the need to strip his roles of adornment. He was 36 before he broke through in 1967’s “Bonnie and Clyde” – a role he got after losing the part of Mr. Robinson in “The Graduate.” Before that, he’d served in the Marines, scuffled in California and New York (sometimes with a roommate, “Graduate” star Dustin Hoffman) and worked odd jobs, including truck driver and doorman. Still, he was fine just with being an actor – regardless of how others viewed his un-movie star face. “Neither Dustin nor myself looked like the leading men of that era, especially Dusty because he wasn’t tall,” he told Film Comment in 1988. “We were constantly told by acting teachers and casting directors that we were ‘character’ actors. The word ‘character’ denotes something less than attractive. “I accepted the limitation of always being the third or fourth guy down, and my goals were tiny,” he continued. “But I still wanted to be an actor.” His acting origins In the beginning, Hackman was lucky to be anything. He was born January 30, 1930, and grew up in Danville, Illinois. His parents divorced when he was an adolescent, and his father, a printing press operator, deserted the family. Hackman, 13 at the time, could still see his father’s goodbye wave in an interview more than four decades later. “I hadn’t realized how much one small gesture can mean,” he told Parade in 1989. “Maybe that’s why I became an actor.” The lack of a father, he added, gave him his hardworking drive; his mother, who had musical talent, and his infirm grandmother, who lived with the family, gave him a fondness for the arts. “I was too young to be left alone, and she was too old to be left alone, so I became very close with her,” he said of the latter. “She was a great storyteller.” He lied about his age to get into the Marines and served five years as a radio operator. He was brash and sometimes angry – he didn’t sugarcoat his attitude in interviews – and moved to Pasadena, California, in 1952 to take up acting. While there, he fell in with Hoffman at the Pasadena Playhouse. The two were voted “least likely to succeed.” That didn’t stop the pair, who moved to New York and became friends with a third struggling actor, Robert Duvall. Hoffman and Duvall became roommates; the three scavenged for parts. Hackman starting getting breaks in 1964, first on Broadway with “Any Wednesday” and then in the movie “Lilith.” The lead in “Lilith” was Warren Beatty, and he didn’t forget his co-star, still climbing, when he was casting “Bonnie and Clyde” a couple years later. Hackman’s performance as Clyde’s brother, Buck Barrow, brought him an Oscar nomination. At this point, Hackman could have relaxed into a long television career: He was the first choice for the role of Mike Brady on “The Brady Bunch.” But a combination of factors – including Hackman’s decision to pursue challenging movie roles and a contract eventual “Brady” star Robert Reed had with its studio – prompted Hackman to take such roles as the no-nonsense coach in 1969’s “Downhill Racer” and the conflicted son in “I Never Sang for My Father.” The latter earned him his second Oscar nomination. He wasn’t the first choice for Popeye Doyle, the combustible detective pursuing a heroin shipment in 1971’s “The French Connection.” According to Hackman, Robert Mitchum, Rod Taylor and New York newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin were all ahead of him. Even after being cast, he had trouble with the role. An early scene had him punching a drug pusher, and Hackman found it difficult to do the violence. “I felt terrible, and the scene was no good. That night, I told (director) Billy Friedkin he should consider replacing me,” he told Film Comment. Friedkin didn’t, and Hackman eventually clicked. Indeed, he clicked so well, he won an Oscar for best actor. The film took home five Oscars, including best picture. Memorable performances His next film was a 180-degree turn: producer Irwin Allen’s all-star disaster epic, “The Poseidon Adventure.” Hackman played a mod priest who leads the trapped passengers of an overturned ocean liner to safety. “When I was working on it, I was kind of ashamed of myself,” he told the UK Guardian. The film was a huge box-office success, anyway. Hackman’s roles were usually pensive and dramatic, but he occasionally ventured away from his comfort zone for comedy. He was a blind hermit in a hilarious scene in Mel Brooks’ 1974 film “Young Frankenstein” and a scenery-chewing Lex Luthor in 1978’s “Superman” and its sequel. Years later, Hackman gave an impulsive spark to Royal Tenenbaum, the patriarch of a neurotic clan in Wes Anderson’s 2001 film “The Royal Tenenbaums.” Despite his talent, Hackman wasn’t always in great films. In interviews, he was as blunt about the successes (1981’s “Reds,” he said, was “difficult”) as the failures. “Hoosiers,” which became a classic, “passed him by,” he told GQ. “I took the film at a time that I was desperate for money. I took it for all the wrong reasons, and it turned out to be one of those films that stick around,” he said. “I never expected the film to have the kind of legs it’s had.” He was sometimes the best thing in bad films. “So many of his roles take (his reliability) for granted and do not think to test him,” wrote David Thomson in the “The New Biographical Dictionary of Film.” For his part, Hackman said, “I suppose a lot of it comes from early days when there wasn’t any work.” But when he had the material, he was a champion. He won his second Oscar for his performance as Little Bill Daggett, the violent sheriff in Clint Eastwood’s 1992 best picture winner, “Unforgiven.” (It was another role he almost turned down, he told CNN.) “Gene Hackman gives one of his most powerful and least mannered performances, displaying an implacable strength and controlled passion that form the essential counterbalance to Eastwood’s own considerable force,” wrote Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times in 1992. He was intimidating in 1993’s “The Firm,” amusing in 1995’s “Get Shorty” and stolid in 2000’s “The Replacements.” But with a handful of exceptions, the latter part of his career seemed to be a series of military men, villainous government officials and lawyers. His last film was inexplicable: the little-seen and poorly received 2004 comedy “Welcome to Mooseport.” At 74, he quietly retired and stuck to it. He became a man of leisure in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and turned to other arts, painting and writing. Another good role never came along. “I don’t have a project, Larry. If you have a script, I’ll read it,” he told Larry King in 2004, a few months after “Mooseport’s” release. “It’s probably all over.” For Hackman, that was OK. He never saw himself as a leading man anyway. “You’d like to (have) been fourth star in all those MGM movies?” King asked. “Yes,” replied Hackman. “I would have liked to have done that.”",,0.29763755202293396
"Val Kilmer, a movie star who throughout his career proved he was up for any task, from playing a cocky naval pilot to wearing the Batman suit, died on Tuesday, according to his daughter Mercedes Kilmer, who released a statement to the New York Times and the Associated Press. He was 65. The cause of death was pneumonia, Mercedes Kilmer told the media outlets. CNN has reached out to representatives for Kilmer and his family for comment. Kilmer had recovered from a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required tracheotomy surgery that altered his voice. In recent years, Kilmer largely stepped away from acting, but made a brief return to the craft in “Top Gun: Maverick,” the sequel to the original film that launched him and that cast into superstardom. The sequel, which released in 2022 after a two-year delay, deftly blended Kilmer’s off-screen health issues into the film’s story, with his Tom “Iceman” Kazansky, the smug but cool rival to Tom Cruise’s Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, ultimately succumbing to an ailment in the film. As one of Kilmer’s last film roles, it concluded one of the most interesting — and bankable — careers in Hollywood history. An impressive career Born and raised in California’s San Fernando Valley, Kilmer studied at the Hollywood Professional School before heading to New York where, at 21, he became the youngest student at the time to be accepted into Julliard School’s drama department. He began his film career in the 1984 comedy “Top Secret!” and acted in several movies throughout the ‘80s including his breakout role in 1986’s “Top Gun.” Then came an incredible streak of successful genre-spanning movies in the 1990s: A superhero film (with 1995’s “Batman Forever,” in which he played the Dark Knight), a Western (1993’s “Tombstone,” where he played Doc Holliday), a biopic (1991’s “The Doors,” in which he portrayed Jim Morrison) and a crime film (Michael Mann’s 1995 masterpiece “Heat”). One of his less lucrative pursuits included his one-man stage show “Citizen Twain,” about Mark Twain, whose work he deeply admired and referenced frequently in interviews. In all, Kilmer’s films made nearly $2 billion at the global box office, according to Comscore. Throughout his career, the roles that Kilmer played possessed an iconic quality while underscoring the way his career frequently zigged at the point where it could have zagged, to his detriment if not in terms of the quality of the work but how Hollywood and the public perceived him. Kilmer enthusiastically agreed to star as Batman, for example, but quickly soured on that experience, passing on another sequel in favor of the forgettable reboot “The Saint.” Similarly, he took a role in “The Island of Dr. Moreau” in order to play opposite Marlon Brando, only to clash with director John Frankenheimer (exchanges caught on camera) and be disappointed when a detached Brando periodically refused to come to the set, letting a stand-in take his place. He reflected on his career and life in the 2021 documentary “Val” through interactions he had videotaped with his family and on film sets for years, including behind-the-scenes footage from “Tombstone” and the “Top Gun” cast partying after hours (“We were all at the start of our careers,” Kilmer recalled). At the time, Kilmer was recovering from throat-cancer surgery, so his son, Jack, read the actor’s written narration — sounding uncannily like his father. Kilmer frequently expressed about his desire to work with certain directors, showing audition videos that he shot for parts he failed to land in “Goodfellas” and “Full Metal Jacket,” seeking to impress directors Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick, respectively. He also documented his laborious auditioning and preparation process for portraying Jim Morrison in “The Doors.” Ultimately, in the documentary, he expressed excitement about all that would come next. “I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. I am blessed,” he said in the movie. Kilmer identified as a Christian Scientist, opening up in interviews about his faith and beliefs. In a 2020 interview with Men’s Health, the actor spoke about illness through the lens of his faith. “Well, something that was reaffirmed to me – on such a level, it was almost shocking – was a sense of universal love, a kind of power and a different sense of love. It was coming into my consciousness and my body while I was at the hospital,” he said, going on to add that he didn’t “believe in death.” Kilmer is survived by his two adult children, Jack and Mercedes, from his marriage to “Willow” co-star Joanne Whalley. The younger Kilmers are both actors and have been involved in projects with their father. Kilmer co-starred with Mercedes in the 2020 film “Paydirt” and, in addition to voicing the “Val” documentary, Jack lent his voice to his father’s character on the Disney+ “Willow” series. Despite his condition at the time of the 2021 documentary, and tragedies that included the death of his younger brother at age 15, Kilmer spoke of leading a “magical life.” He said that he found the silver lining even as he endured fans asking for the same “Top Gun”-inspired “You can be my wingman” autograph over and over at Comic-Con. “I feel grateful,” he said.

"Michelle Trachtenberg, the actress who rose to fame as a precocious child star in “Harriet the Spy” and went on to have memorable roles on TV shows including “Gossip Girl,” has died, according to the New York City police. She was 39. Police responded to a 911 call on Wednesday just after 8 a.m. local time and found a woman unconscious and unresponsive inside a Manhattan apartment. She was later identified as Trachtenberg, according to an NYPD spokesperson. EMS responded to the location and pronounced the victim deceased. “Criminality is not suspected,” the NYPD said in a statement, adding that the investigation remains ongoing. Trachtenberg’s official cause of death will come from the Medical Examiner’s office. Earlier on Wednesday, an NYPD source told CNN that Trachtenberg reportedly had a recent medical issue and that her death appeared to be related to natural causes and not suspicious. “The family requests privacy for their loss. There are no further details at this time,” a representative for Trachtenberg told CNN in a statement. With her cheeky demeanor and sharp comedic timing, Trachtenberg fit in naturally with the over-the-top humor that dominated Nickelodeon in the ’90s. She first gained attention with a role on “The Adventures of Pete & Pete” and went on to star in Nickelodeon’s first feature film, 1996’s “Harriet the Spy.” In the latter, she shared the screen with Rosie O’Donnell, young Gregory Smith and J. Smith-Cameron, who would go on to star in “Succession” and played her mother in the project. Looking back at the experience, which took place just as she turned 10 years old, Trachtenberg called O’Donnell her “biggest supporter” on the set. “There was a lot required of me. I’m extremely grateful for the experience,” she told Entertainment Tonight in 2001. “When I do look at social media, which is challenging, [I see] them coming in with, ‘You inspired my life. You made me become a writer,’ …All of those, just beautiful things.” When reached for comment, O’Donnell described Trachtenberg’s death as “heartbreaking.” “I loved her very much,” she added. Other Nickelodeon stars from the era who knew and worked with Trachtenberg, like Melissa Joan Hart and Kenan Thompson, have also expressed their condolences. In 2000, Trachtenberg landed the role of Dawn Summers on The WB hit series “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” playing Buffy’s (Sarah Michelle Gellar) younger sister. At the time, fans were vocal about their mixed feelings about the character, who debuted in the show’s fifth season. Years later, Trachtenberg joked about the backlash telling Entertainment Weekly, “Most of the haters don’t have the guts to say things in person.” “I rarely get the ‘Oh she ruined the show.’ I do get a lot of ‘Oh she was so whiny!’ Hi, were you a teenager?” she said. Trachtenberg remained with the series until its conclusion in 2003. On Wednesday, her costar James Marsters shared a tribute to her on his verified Instagram, writing that his “heart is heavy today. We have lost a beautiful soul. Michelle was fiercely intelligent, howlingly funny, and a very talented person.” As Trachtenberg grew up off screen and straddled that complicated time between childhood and teen years, her roles followed suit. In 2004, she starred in the raunchy teen comedy “EuroTrip,” then appeared in several episodes of premium cable drama “Six Feet Under.” The next year, she starred in a Disney movie, playing an aspiring ice skater in “Ice Princess” alongside Kim Cattrall. Cattrall shared a picture from their film together to social media on Wednesday, writing, “Rest in peace sweet Michelle.” Then came a moment of reinvention, thanks to the CW’s “Gossip Girl,” on which she played the deliciously villainous Georgina Sparks, a recurring foe who cooked up the drama that fed the show’s popularity. Trachtenberg seemingly relished in the fun. “It’s kind of easy to be evil when you’re saying evil things. It’s definitely a lot more fun than playing the good girl,” she told Seventeen magazine in 2009. “I love the reaction you get. I never understood why some actors don’t want to play villains or evil characters.” Her other credits include guest parts on “House,” “Law & Order: Criminal Intent” and “Sleepy Hollow.” She most recently appeared in two episodes of Max’s “Gossip Girl” revival. It is unclear what she was working on at the time of her death, but Trachtenberg was active on social media. In the past week, she posted photos from her previous red carpets and reflected on the fashion. “A memory, a magical night in #newyork. I remember feeling like Cinderella,” she wrote on one post roughly a week ago. “Wishing everyone an ethereal weekend.” This story has been updated.",,0.3123988211154938
"Wink Martindale, a radio and television entertainer known to audiences as host of classic game shows including “Tic-Tac-Dough” and “Gambit,” has died. He was 91. Martindale’s death was confirmed in a news release from his representative Brian Mayes, who also told CNN he was a family friend. Martindale died Tuesday in Rancho Mirage, California. Born Winston Conrad Martindale in Jackson, Tennessee in 1933, he was transfixed from an early age by the family radio, eventually going on to succeed in the entertainment industry thanks to his talent, demeanor and that booming voice. According to the news release, Martindale started his career as a disc jockey in Jackson at 17, but quickly ascended the ranks to eventually work at WHBQ in Memphis, where in July 1954 Elvis Presley’s first record “That’s All Right” was played on the radio for the very first time by a fellow DJ. Due to the immediate and overwhelming demand, the other DJ played the song again and again while Martindale telephoned Presley’s mother and asked if Presley could come down to the radio station. The music legend soon arrived at WHBQ for his first interview. After this more than auspicious start, Martindale went on to a remarkable 74-year career, which included him finding gold-record success as a recording artist in his own right. His rendition of the spoken-word song “Deck of Cards” went to #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #5 on the UK Singles Chart, selling more than one million copies in 1959. That same year, Martindale became the morning DJ at KHJ in Los Angeles, moving again a year later to the morning show at KRLA and finally to KFWB in 1962. He enjoyed lengthy stays at many other radio stations, including Gene Autry’s KMPC from 1971-1979 and 1983-1987, the release said. Martindale is credited with having broken some of the biggest hits and artists of the 60s and 70s, spinning iconic songs for the first time on his radio shows. Martindale’s additional radio credits include “Hit Parade Radio” and the syndicated programs “Music of Your Life,” “100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time,” “The History of Rock ‘n’ Roll,” and recent recurring appearances on “The Howard Stern Show.” Alongside his radio and music pursuits, Martindale found success on television as well, ultimately becoming a perennial figure as a smiling and debonair game show host. His first break into TV was at WHBQ-TV in Memphis, as the host of “Mars Patrol,” a science-fiction themed children’s television series, and then as host of “Teenage Dance Party,” where his friend Presley made an appearance in June 1956. His first game-show hosting job came in the mid-1960’s, on NBC’s “What’s This Song?” followed by NBC’s “Words and Music,” CBS’ “Gambit,” and his biggest success, “Tic-Tac-Dough.” Martindale also went on to host other popular game shows like “Headline Chasers,” “High Rollers,” “The Last Word,” “The Great Getaway Game,” “Trivial Pursuit,” “Debt,” “Instant Recall,” and many more. In recent years, he made appearances on programs including “Most Outrageous Game Show Moments,” “The Chase,” and “The Bold and the Beautiful.” In 1985, Martindale became a producer with the launch of the TV game show “Headline Chasers,” produced in association with Merv Griffin and syndication giant King World. An avid philanthropist, Martindale supported various causes and produced and hosted annual telethons for Cerebral Palsy and St. Jude Children’s Hospital, among many other charities. In 2006, Martindale received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in 2024, he was honored with a Beale Street Note on Memphis, Tennessee’s Beale Street Walk of Fame – not far from where in 2015, he was presented with the Distinguished Alumni Award by his alma mater, the University of Memphis, according to the news release. Martindale was also one of the first inductees into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame. At the time of his death, Martindale was surrounded by family and his wife of 49 years, Sandra Martindale, the release said. Martindale is survived by his wife Sandra, sister Geraldine, his daughters Lisa, Lyn and Laura and a large extended family full of grandchildren and great grandchildren, his honorary son Eric and his beloved Chihuahua, Dude.",,0.3668612241744995
"Stanley Tucci experienced a delayed effect of cancer treatment from years ago that caused him a fair amount of concern. On a recent episode of “David Tennant Does a Podcast With…,” the “Conclave” star described feeling “so tired in the afternoon” while filming episodes of his “Searching For Italy” show last year. “Like completely exhausted by one o’clock and I was like, ‘something’s wrong with me,’” Tucci added. He said he proceeded to get a blood test that revealed that his “thyroid was non-functioning.” Tucci explained that he and his doctors then tried to discern what was causing the issue, ruling out stress, cholesterol or other possible factors. “What happened was because I had radiation six, seven years ago, it burned out my thyroid,” Tucci said.

"Bruce Springsteen is set to release over 80 new songs this summer with his newly announced “Tracks II: The Lost Albums” collection. Planned for release on June 27, the seven full-length albums will include songs by The Boss that have never been heard. The songs span Springsteen’s decades-long career and were written between 1983 and 2018. Springsteen said that he finished everything he had in his “vault” during the pandemic – the final product of which became these upcoming seven albums – according to a trailer released Thursday. “’The Lost Albums’ were full records, some of them even to the point of being mixed and not released,” Springsteen said in a statement on Thursday. “I’ve played this music to myself and often close friends for years now. I’m glad you’ll get a chance to finally hear them. I hope you enjoy them.” On Thursday, Springsteen gave the first taste of the “Lost Albums” by releasing his first single “Rain In The River,” which comes from one of the new lost albums titled “Perfect World.” The other album titles, according to a news release, are “LA Garage Sessions ‘83,” “Streets of Philadelphia Sessions,” “Faithless,” “Somewhere North of Nashville,” “Inyo” and “Twilight Hours.” The collection of albums will offer a variety of sounds, including everything from the legendary musician’s signature drum loop and synth sound to country-inspired melodies to orchestra-driven instrumentation, the release said. “The ability to record at home whenever I wanted allowed me to go into a wide variety of different musical directions,” Springsteen said. Springsteen is set to kick off the European leg of his tour with the E Street Band in May in Manchester, and end in July in Milan.",,0.2592533826828003
"Bella Ramsey is sharing that they were diagnosed with autism. The “Last of Us” star, who uses they/them pronouns, opened up about their diagnosis in an interview with British Vogue published Thursday. “I’ve spoken a bit about neurodivergence before, but I always for some reason didn’t want to,” Ramsey said, before deciding to share that they “got diagnosed with autism when I was filming Season 1 of The Last of Us.” According to the publication, Ramsey seeked out a psychiatric assessment after a crew member with an autistic child had assumed Ramsey, too, had autism. The diagnosis, they added, also confirmed a suspicion that Ramsey had “always wondered” about. In fact, Ramsey went on to share that their diagnosis has helped improve their acting. “I’ve always been watching and learning from people. Having to learn more manually how to socialize and interact with the people around me has helped me with acting,” they said. They added that having a routine and a set of rules also helps, saying, “I have a call time, and I’m told what to wear, how to stand, where to stand and what to eat.” The diagnosis overall, Ramsey said, is “freeing” because it “enables me to walk through the world with more grace towards myself about not being able to do the easy everyday tasks that everyone else seems to be able to do.” “My experience of moving through the world is as an autistic person,” they added. “There’s no reason for people not to know.” Ramsey is best known for starring in HBO’s “The Last of Us,” a series based on the popular video game of the same name that also stars Pedro Pascal. Ramsey also appeared in three seasons of “Game of Thrones” as Lyanna Marmont. (HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.) “The Last of Us” Season 2 is set to debut in April.",,0.2399926781654358

"Jillian Shriner, an author and the wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, was involved in a situation with police that resulted in her being shot by law enforcement and subsequently arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon in the East LA neighborhood of Eagle Rock, when officers attempting to track a suspect of an unrelated hit-and-run were in the rear yard of a residence and observed a woman in a “neighboring residence armed with a handgun,” an LAPD news release read. The woman was later identified as Jillian Shriner. “The officers ordered Shriner to drop the handgun numerous times; however, she refused. Shriner then pointed the handgun at the officers, and an Officer-Involved Shooting occurred,” the release read. “Shriner was struck by gunfire and fled into her residence. She later exited and was taken into custody.” She was released Wednesday after posting a $1 million bond, according to publicly available records. She is due in court on April 30. CNN has reached out to representatives for Jillian Shriner and Weezer for comment. A representative with the LAPD was unable to confirm why Shriner was holding a gun at the time, given she had no apparent connection to the hit-and-run police were responding to. Police recovered a 9-millimeter firearm from the home, according to the release. No officers or other people were injured during the incident. In video captured by CNN affiliate KCBS/KCAL, two women were seen walking out of a home to the street with their hands up. Later on, one of the women, believed to be Shriner, is seen laying face down on the ground. Police then handcuffed her as other officers stood by. In separate aerial footage captured by CNN affiliate KABC, the same woman was seen walking slowly as she was assisted by medics to get on an ambulance. Jillian Shriner was taken to a local hospital where she was treated for a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. One of the male suspects connected to the hit-and-run was detained and subsequently released by the California Highway Patrol but other two suspects were not located. Shriner is the author of four books, including her best-selling 2010 memoir, “Some Girls: My Life in a Harem,” which detailed her experience living in the harem of Prince Jefri Bolkiah of Brunei. She and Scott Shriner, the bassist for the rock band Weezer, have been married since 2005. Weezer was recently added to the Coachella Festival lineup this coming weekend and are scheduled to perform at the Mojave tent on Saturday.",,0.28802192211151123
"Stevie Nicks is continuing to leave Fleetwood Mac in her (gold) dust with a newly announced solo album. The music legend was on hand at the Pollstar Awards earlier this week, where she was entered into the Hall of Fame. During her speech, she mentioned that she’s making a new “autobiographical” record and already has seven songs. Calling it “the ghost record,” Nicks said it “just kinda happened in the last couple weeks” while she was “sitting in a hotel for 92 days” as a result of the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles in January. “I feel like I’m on the road, but there’s no shows,” she described, which led her to think, “You need to go back to work.” “And I did, and I have seven songs, and they are autobiographical, real stories where I’m not pulling any punches, for probably the first time in my life. They are not airy, fairy songs that you are wondering who they’re about, but you don’t really get it. They’re real stories of memories of mine of fantastic men,” she said. The “Landslide” songstress went onto tease the crowd with one of those stories, involving the late and great Prince, who she identified as a friend. Nicks recounted how she attended the premiere of the iconic film “Purple Rain” in the ’80s, and how she only watched the first half of the movie up until a moment when Prince’s character slapped Apollonia. Afterward, she explained that she went to the premiere’s afterparty across the street, where Prince asked her what she thought of the film. She sheepishly told him she only saw the first half, but as consolation, offered him the gift she had brought for him – a 24 karat necklace with gold hearts on it. Prince told her that he didn’t want the necklace, going on to say, “You always bring me a gift, you never bring me you.” Nicks said that that line was the launch point for her new record. The artist has, to date, released eight solo studio albums in addition to the eight albums she produced with Fleetwood Mac, among other projects. She is an eight-time Grammy winner twice inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, according to Rolling Stone.",,0.24531163275241852
"The cause of death for actress Michelle Trachtenberg, who died in February, was confirmed to be complications of diabetes mellitus, a spokesperson for the New York City Office of the Medical Examiner confirmed to CNN on Wednesday. Her cause of death was initially ruled as undetermined because her family declined an autopsy, a spokesperson for the medical examiner’s office told CNN at the time, and because Trachtenberg’s death was not deemed suspicious by law enforcement, the medical examiner’s office honored that request, the spokesperson said. Trachtenberg, who was best known for appearing in “Harriet the Spy,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Gossip Girl,” died on February 26 in Manhattan. She was 39. Police responded to a 911 call just after 8 a.m. local time and found a woman unconscious and unresponsive inside a Manhattan apartment. She was later identified as Trachtenberg, an NYPD spokesperson told CNN at the time. EMS responded to the location and pronounced the victim deceased. An NYPD source told CNN that Trachtenberg reportedly had a recent medical issue and that her death appeared to be related to natural causes. Her manner of death was ruled as natural, the spokesperson for the medical examiner’s office told CNN on Wednesday. Trachtenberg started as a child actor on Nickelodeon in the ’90s where she first gained attention with a role on “The Adventures of Pete & Pete.” She went on to star in Nickelodeon’s first feature film, 1996’s “Harriet the Spy,” sharing the screen with Rosie O’Donnell. In 2000, Trachtenberg appeared in the WB hit series “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” playing Dawn Summers, Buffy’s (Sarah Michelle Gellar) younger sister. She went on to star in a variety of roles including the raunchy teen comedy “EuroTrip,” premium cable drama “Six Feet Under” and the Disney movie “Ice Princess” before playing the villainous Georgina Sparks on “Gossip Girl.”",,0.36954665184020996
"Rachel Accurso, the popular YouTuber and child educator known as Ms. Rachel, and her husband Aron have welcomed a baby girl to their family. Accurso announced the happy news on her Instagram page on Tuesday, showing a photo of herself snuggling with her newborn daughter named Susannah. “We are so in love!” she wrote in the caption. “Sometimes timing isn’t what you plan and the road to get there is bumpier than you expect, but when you hold your little ones you know… I’m meant to be your mama.” Accurso shared that they used a surrogate because she was “unable to carry this pregnancy for medical reasons,” adding that they “were blessed to have a surrogate who gave us the most precious gift possible.” “We are now all family forever. We have immense gratitude and a deep bond. It’s been a truly beautiful experience. I’m in awe of her,” she added. The Accursos are already parents to a son, seven-year-old Thomas.

"Madonna and Elton John have made amends after a notorious years-long feud that saw the two publicly trading barbs against each other since 2004. As seen on Madonna’s verified Instagram on Monday, the “Vogue” singer went to watch John perform on “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, later sharing a photo posing with him as proof that the pair are now friends. “We Finally Buried the Hatchet!!!” Madonna wrote in the caption. “Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist. I didn’t understand it.” Madonna wrote that once she heard John was the “SNL” musical guest, she “decided to go.” “I needed to go backstage and confront him,” she wrote. “When I met him, the first thing out of his mouth was, “Forgive Me” and the wall between us fell down. Forgiveness is a powerful tool. Within minutes. We were hugging.” She added that John had written a song for her and wants to collaborate. The legendary pair’s so-called feud famously stems from a comment John made at the 2004 Q Awards while he accepted the award for classic songwriter, where he accused Madonna of lip-syncing. The superstars have since traded insults in public fashion. In 2012, Madonna beat John at the Golden Globes, when she took home the gong for best original song for her track “Masterpiece” from her film “W.E.” over John’s “Hello Hello” from the animated movie “Gnomeo & Juliet.” Ahead of the show, John was on the red carpet and said that she didn’t “stand a f—ing chance” for the award, and while her Madgesty was later on stage delivering her acceptance speech, the camera cut away to John, whose look was pure daggers. Nowadays, it seems, the two have come together and made peace and instead of slamming John, Madonna is praising his legacy. “Seeing him perform when I was in high school changed the course of my life,” she wrote in her Instagram post on Monday. “I had always felt like an outsider growing up and watching him on stage helped me to understand that it was OK to be different.” Later on Monday, John commented on Madonna’s post thanking her for “forgiving me and my big mouth” and acknowledging the “groundbreaking work” she’s done as an artist, as well as nodding to her HIV/AIDS advocacy work since the 1980s. “I’m grateful we can move forward. I’m increasingly distressed by all the divisiveness in our world at the moment,” he wrote. “Both you and I have wholeheartedly been accepted and embraced by communities who are under threat around the world. By pulling together, I’m hopeful that we can make great things happen for those who really need support.”",,0.24055472016334534
"The madame of “Mayhem” Lady Gaga was again on the main stage at Coachella on Friday night for the event’s second weekend, and she didn’t let some momentary tech glitches stop her. As she did on the first weekend of the mega-fest in Indio, California, the Grammy- and Oscar-winner pulled off a showstopping opening that included her recent single “Abracadabra,” which had her head mic cut out for a few seconds. Gaga soon reappeared with a hand mic for the remainder of the song, before seamlessly getting fitted with a new head mic for the rest of her set. Later at the piano, Gaga apologized for the earlier snafu, saying, “I’m sorry my mic was broken for a second. At least you know sing live!” As the crowd cheered, she added, “I guess all we can do is our best and I’m certainly giving you my best tonight.” “Abracadabra” is the second single off of Gaga’s seventh solo album “Mayhem,” which dropped last month. The album’s first single, “Disease,” came out last fall. Also in March, Lady Gaga announced her “Mayhem Ball” tour, which will kick off July 16 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The tour will hit Seattle, New York, Miami, Chicago and Toronto through the summer, before heading to Europe in September.

"Will Forte is remembering when his good friend and “MacGruber” costar Val Kilmer – who he called “the most interesting person in the world” – ended up living with him for nearly three months. In an essay published by Vulture on Friday, Forte remembered Kilmer, who died from pneumonia this week at the age of 65, as “incredibly funny and incredibly smart. He could be super-silly and then turn around and be a little frickin’ devil – but a sweet little devil. Life is more vivid when you’re hanging out with Val.” Forte explained that the pair had become “pretty tight” after shooting “MacGruber,” which was based on a recurring “Saturday Night Live” spoof of “MacGyver” featuring Forte and co-starring Kilmer as zany villain Dieter Von Cunth. Due to some real estate issues, Forte said Kilmer was looking for a new place to live, and approached him about staying at his place “for a couple days.” “I don’t remember if he said ‘a couple days,’ but I got the impression that it was going to be a couple days,” Forte wrote. “So he showed up on a Monday, and later that day, his assistant came over with two huge duffel bags filled with books, and I’m like, Oh, this seems like it’s maybe going to be more than a couple days. It ended up being two and a half months.” Related gallery
      Val Kilmer’s life in pictures Forte went on to give snapshots of what it was like living with the “Doors” star, from coming home to a darkened house only to find Kilmer reading with a miner’s headlamp on, to wearing boxers on his head, or spontaneously going jogging with him in a linen suit. “One of the great joys of my life is, as I turned around to look back at him, I saw him jogging back in my direction in this linen suit,” Forte wrote. “That was him – just full of surprises. Just the most unique person I’ve ever met.” They also connected on various television shows, including “The Amazing Race.” At one point, Kilmer came home to find Forte watching it and dismissed the reality competition show as useless fodder that’s “going to rot your mind.” Forte succeeded in convincing Kilmer to try watching it, and soon he was hooked. “Then, at a certain point, he said, ‘Will, you and I have to go do “The Amazing Race.” We have to. Let’s do “The Amazing Race.”’ I’m like, ‘I am so fully in.’” He continued to write that they even called their respective agents about getting on the show, but they put the kibosh on it. “That is, maybe to this day, the biggest regret of my whole career – that I never did ‘The Amazing Race’ with Val. I think we would’ve gotten out very quickly, but it just would’ve been the experience of a lifetime.”",,0.33275726437568665
"Singer Robbie Williams has revealed that he was diagnosed with scurvy, a vitamin deficiency, earlier this year. Williams, 51, shared his health update in an interview with the Mirror published Monday, saying that he learned of his diagnosis after he’d been struggling with his mental health in recent months. “The year started with some ill mental health, which I haven’t had for a very, very long time,” he said, adding that he was feeling “sad, I was anxious, I was depressed.” The “Take That” singer told the publication that he’d first been diagnosed with depression in his 20s and it had been some time since he’d battled it. “I thought I was at the other end of the arc,” he said. “So for it to return was just confusing.” Williams began to suspect that his diet could be a contributing factor in how he was feeling. “I’d stopped eating and I wasn’t getting nutrients,” he said, adding that he was later diagnosed with scurvy, which he described as a “17th century pirate disease.” Scurvy is a serious vitamin C deficiency and is caused by a lack of the nutrient in one’s diet, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The condition is rare in the US because of the country’s nutrient-rich diet, and is usually seen in countries where people are malnourished. After addressing changes in his diet, Williams said, his health and depression became manageable. “The most important thing is for yourself to be okay,” he said. Williams is about to kick off a tour in the UK, Ireland and Europe beginning in May and going through the summer. His recent biographical musical drama “A Better Man,” released last year, was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects.",,0.2585444152355194

So, what happens now that President Donald Trump has art-of-the-dealed his way out of his own centerpiece economic initiative because it nearly broke financial markets? No one knows. But the White House may have finally torched its credibility on Wall Street. Investors and analysts outside the MAGA ecosystem saw right through the White House’s almost-comical line that Wednesday’s tariff U-turn was all part of the plan. Those same folks were similarly unmoved Thursday when Trump dangled tax cuts and deregulation — two of Wall Street’s favorite things — right in front of their noses. And they’re looking right past a positive inflation report that, in normal times, would be a cause for celebration. Related article
      Trump wants to play market hero. But the economic damage is done Stocks tumbled Thursday, with the Dow initially sinking more than 2,000 points before paring some losses and ending the day down around 1,000 points, or 2.5%. The S&P 500 fell 3.5% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 4.3%. Oil prices also fell, giving up all of Wednesday’s gains, as traders feared a global recession could sap demand. “The market is effectively putting its pencils down and saying, ‘I’m not buying into this,’ Daniel Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, told me. “I can’t make a determination of what my risk–reward is right now, until there’s further clarification.” Wednesday’s tariff pause brought stock and bond markets back from the brink, a sharp rally that Trump was quick to claim credit for. But Thursday morning, investors woke up to a new reality: The bond market panic largely abated overnight, but US stocks tumbled despite good news from the Consumer Price Index report for last month, which found inflation cooled faster than expected. Not even the news that House lawmakers advanced Trump’s budget blueprint — which includes “the Largest Tax and Regulation Cuts ever even contemplated,” Trump wrote cheerfully in a Truth Social post — was enough to lift investors’ spirits. Even Trump seemed to concede on Thursday there were some “transition problems” with the sudden shift in policy. A lot can happen in 90 days under Trump 2.0. And that’s part of the problem for Wall Street. Given all the rug-pulls markets have experienced already, investors’ can’t always trust that Trump will do the thing he says he’s doing, or that he won’t back out at the last minute. That’s keeping many investors on the sidelines for now. Unless the White House can actually hammer out dozens of complex bilateral trade deals over the next three months, “we’re going to be right back in this again,” Alpert noted.",,0.3241526186466217
"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. This is all pretty embarrassing. It’s been two weeks since President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff speech launched a global trade war, premised on absurd math, and erased trillions of dollars in market value. Every day since has been a stream of contradictory statements and brinkmanship with no way of knowing which declarations will stick. (Not helping: The looming threat of a constitutional crisis as the White House picks fights with American courts, higher education, the entire legal profession and most of the media.) It’s no wonder then that the rest of the world is taking a look at the United States — as a trading partner, a travel destination, a steward of the global financial market — and shaking their heads. Even before the tariffs were announced, multiple European countries, Canada and China issued travel updates warning their citizens about potentially being detained at the US border. Canadians have been especially vocal about canceling their trips to the US in protest of Trump’s policies, including tariffs. But they’re not alone: All foreign arrivals into major US airports tumbled 20% late last month compared with the same period a year ago, according to an Axios analysis — a fact that should alarm the more than $2 trillion US travel and tourism industry. The world’s appetite for American-made stuff is also taking a hit, especially in China, which is retaliating against Washington’s 145% tariff. On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Beijing has halted all deliveries of aircraft and parts made by Boeing, that quintessentially American manufacturer that directly or indirectly supports 1.6 million US jobs. Whether Beijing’s move is a negotiating tactic or a lasting boycott of the plane maker, it is decidedly bad news for Boeing, which hasn’t turned a profit in more than five years. But it’s great news for Boeing’s European rival, Airbus. It’s not just planes. The tariffs are hitting China at a moment when US brands like Apple, Nike, Tesla and Starbucks are losing market share to homemade rivals, as the Wall Street Journal reports. That consumer rejection is an especially thorny issue for businesses. “You see a lot of danger for US brands and US manufacturers in the current environment, both directly from retaliation by other governments, and indirectly from a very negative consumer response to American products in general,” John Gilbert, an economics professor at Utah State University, told me. “People have memories — I’m not sure how much that dissipates, even if the governments of those countries can come up with some kind of agreement.” And of course, there’s the turmoil in the US Treasury market — the clearest, and frankly scariest, rebuke of Trump’s tariff policies to date. ICYMI: When stocks fell in response to tariffs, the market for US government bonds — the boring-est, safest, most vanilla of assets — should have been the go-to place for investors. That didn’t happen. Sleepy Treasuries started behaving like risk assets, a sign that investors are losing confidence in America’s ability to pay its debt and manage its economy. That’s the financial equivalent of a five-alarm fire. Meanwhile, the value of the US dollar has been falling — another sign investors are shying away from what has historically been the market’s safe haven. “I think this is one of the biggest ‘own goals’ to US credibility in financial markets that I’ve ever seen in my lifetime,” said Heidi Crebo-Rediker, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an interview. “You can look at the global financial crisis as being a hit to US credibility in terms of financial markets, but this is different… Covid was an external shock. This comes straight out of the White House.”",,0.2508464753627777
"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Even if the writing has been on the wall for years, breaking up is never easy. China and the US don’t often see eye to eye, but for decades, they have broadly agreed that it is better to be trade partners than trade enemies. That alliance is now hanging by a thread. And the real-world collateral damage is already piling up. The presidents of the world’s two biggest economies don’t appear ready to talk turkey. China indicated Wednesday that it would be open to negotiations only if talks are based on “respect,” and greater “consistency and reciprocity” from the Trump administration, a person familiar with the matter told my CNN colleagues. (I, for one, am not holding my breath.) Without some kind of retrenchment, US-China trade is expected to fall by more than 80% — a magnitude “tantamount to a decoupling,” said Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, the director general of the World Trade Organization, which issued a similarly grim report on global trade Wednesday. (The upshot: Pre-Trump tariffs, global trade was penciled in to grow 2.7% this year. Now, it’s expected to shrink 0.2%.) Here’s how Trump’s trade war is already rippling through the economy: US stocks tumbled on Wednesday — dragged down by Nvidia’s China shut-out, the grim forecast from the WTO, and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who warned of a “challenging scenario” in which tariffs lead to a triple whammy of weaker economic growth, higher unemployment and faster inflation, all at the same time. “There isn’t a modern experience for how to think about this,” Powell said at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday. You might think the “Art of the Deal” president would be eager to hash out some kind of pact with China. But if Trump has taught the world anything, it’s to expect the unexpected. “There may be another game plan here,” Ed Yardeni, a veteran investor and president of Yardeni Research, told investor Louis Navellier on his Navellier Market Buzz podcast. “It’s conceivable that he’s got no interest in doing a deal with China. It’s conceivable that the US has come to the conclusion that China is a geopolitical threat… and what we’re trying to do is ruin their economy.” Related article
      Trump is waiting for Xi to call. The Chinese see it differently Some new reporting from Bloomberg is lending weight to that theory. According to the news outlet, which cited unnamed sources, the Trump administration is “preparing to pressure nations to curb trade with China.” One option on the table, Bloomberg said, is essentially a monetary sanction in which the US would ask other nations to impose tariffs on certain countries with close ties to China. Whether a trade deal is the goal or not, “it’s not a pretty thing to watch,” Yardeni said. “He is trying to use America’s economic power to bully other countries… But it’s going to be real hard to bully China.” As many observers have noted, China may be in a stronger position to withstand a tit-for-tat trade war, in part because it maintains an authoritarian grip on every facet of its economy. But perhaps more importantly, Beijing has learned from its first go-round with Trump in 2017. The country is already going beyond the tit-for-tat measures that characterized the earlier trade feud. China’s halt on Boeing deliveries and its restrictions on rare-earth exports show that the country “has learned how to weaponize its imports in a new way,” Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview. “China still wants to look like a respectable stakeholder” to trading partners like Australia, the EU and Southeast Asia, where President Xi Jinping visited this week, Lovely notes. “They want to say, ‘The door is open. We’re reasonable, we’re just combating US aggression.’ And they are doing it now with a much bigger set of tools.”",,0.2684768736362457

"US stocks plunged, bitcoin stumbled and Wall Street’s fear gauge hit its highest level this year as concerns about President Donald Trump’s economic policy led to a widespread market selloff on Monday. The rout on Wall Street started early, with all three major indexes opening sharply in the red. US stocks slid throughout the day and, despite a brief afternoon rally, closed in the red. The Dow closed lower by 890 points, or 2.08%, pulling back from a loss of more than 1,100 points at one point. The broader S&P 500 also plunged, dropping by 2.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. The Dow and S&P 500 each posted their worst day of the year. The Nasdaq posted its biggest single-day decline since September 2022. The rout extended a miserable month for markets that has seen all three major indexes wipe out their gains since the US presidential election in November. The widespread selloff was mostly driven by anxiety about the impact of Trump’s tariffs. In an interview that aired Sunday, Trump said the US economy would see “a period of transition” and refused to rule out a recession. When asked on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo” if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump said “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.” Tech stocks led the selloff, weighing on the S&P 500 and dragging the Nasdaq into correction territory. The S&P 500 closed down 8.6% from its record high on February 19. The “Magnificent Seven” of tech stocks — Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — were all in the red on Monday. “President Trump’s comments not necessarily taking a recession off the table unnerved investors who were already unnerved,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. The White House on Monday said Trump was set to spark “historic” growth in his second term. “Since President Trump was elected, industry leaders have responded to President Trump’s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy with trillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of new jobs,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term.” Tesla erases post-election gains Tesla closed down 15.4% on Monday. After the US presidential election in November, shares of Tesla surged. However, Tesla stock is down almost 45% this year, wiping out its gains since November. The company’s shares have taken a massive hit in recent weeks amid protests against CEO Elon Musk for his oversized role in the Trump administration, as well as slumping sales in Europe.

The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest level this year. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving markets for the past two weeks, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. “This uncertainty has been swirling in the market,” Saglimbene said. Bitcoin slid to around $78,000 on Monday — its lowest level since November — amid a selloff of risky assets. Tariff uncertainty spooking Wall Street Stocks have been hammered so far this month amid uncertainty around Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policy. The S&P 500 slid 3.1% last week, posting its worst week since September. “The stock market is losing its confidence in the Trump 2.0 policies,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Trump threatened a massive tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico but then announced a reprieve until April 2. He doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%, and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports is set to take effect March 12. In addition, Trump threatened last week to enact a 250% tariff on Canadian dairy products and a “tremendously high” tariff on its lumber. On Sunday he told Fox that tariffs may still “go up as time goes by.” “The talk of tariffs is, in a lot of ways, worse than the implementation of them,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group. “The tariff talk, reversal, speculation, and chaos only fosters uncertainty.” “I do not believe the administration knows how the tariff situation will play out, but if I were a betting man I would say that it will persist long enough to do damage to economic activity for at least a quarter or two, and ultimately result in a deal with different countries that make everyone wonder why we went through all the fuss,” he said in a note Monday.

      Cracks are forming in America’s economy. Trump is a big reason why And cracks are forming elsewhere: Layoffs are mounting, hiring is slowing, consumer confidence is eroding and inflation is picking up. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slid to 4.225% as investors snapped up government bonds, signaling concerns about uncertainty and economic growth. Looking ahead this week, investors will be attuned to monthly inflation data expected on Wednesday and Thursday to gauge whether inflation remained stubborn in February. A recession is commonly defined by two consecutive negative quarters of gross domestic product growth. The National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee, the official arbiters, says a recession “involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.” “How long this period of investor caution persists depends on how quickly it will take the global trade clouds, and the resulting threat of recession, to dissipate,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, in a note Monday.

"Roomba’s parent company is warning that its future is on shaky ground, more than a year after a planned $1.7 billion acquisition by Amazon fell through. iRobot (IRBT), a maker of robotic vacuum cleaners, has “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue,” it revealed in its quarterly earnings report Wednesday. The stark warning torpedoed the company’s stock 30% lower in premarket trading. The Massachusetts-based company also said its board is exploring a “strategic review of alternatives for the business” that could portend a sale and refinancing of its mounting debt. The news comes about 14 months after Amazon abandoned plans to buy the company because of concerns from European Union’s regulators, who threatened to block the deal. Soon afterward, iRobot founder Colin Angle departed the company, its stock cratered and the company laid off about half of its employees. iRobot has been working to turn things around. This week the company released eight new Roombas, marking the largest product launch in the company’s 30-year history. iRobot hopes the new products will help boost its revenue, which plunged 44% in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. However, the company warned Wednesday that there’s “no assurance” the new products “will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to, consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” CEO Gary Cohen, however, remains optimistic. In the earnings release he said “this strong pipeline of breakthrough new products” should improve profit margins compared to earlier product lines and “should begin to support year-over-year revenue growth in 2025.”",,0.2791518270969391
"The rocky week on Wall Street continued on Thursday as investors grappled with further uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. US stocks opened sharply lower but fluctuated on the mixed messaging coming from the White House. All three major indexes closed lower, despite Trump announcing a nearly one-month tariff delay on all products from Mexico and Canada that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty. Earlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the president would likely announce a one-month tariff delay on products that are covered by the USMCA. The Dow closed lower by 428 points, or 0.99%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.78% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.61%. The Nasdaq closed in correction territory, down 10% from its record high in December. That leaves the Dow down almost 3% on the week, on track for its worst week since March 2023. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both on pace for their worst week since September 2024. The market is in the red during Trump’s presidency in part because of the uncertainty the administration’s trade policy has caused. The Nasdaq has fallen more than 7% since Trump took office, and the S&P 500 is down more than 4%. Investor sentiment is struggling due to the persistent uncertainty around tariffs, according to Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. “Eventually, that uncertainty is just going to weigh too much on business decisions and those forward prospects for earnings growth,” Haworth said. Also in focus for investors: recent data revealing the extent of recent layoffs and renewed concerns about spending on artificial intelligence. Futures tied to the Dow had tumbled in early trading as new economic data showed unease in the labor market. US-based employers last month announced plans to slash 172,017 jobs, a 103% increase from January and the highest February total since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas’s latest monthly job cuts report.

      US employers cut more jobs last month than any February since 2009 Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 also fell in early trading as companies focused on the AI trade posted mixed earnings results and guidance for this year. Marvell Technologies (MRVL), a chipmaker, fell by almost 20%. Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) also slid, dragging the Nasdaq lower. Chinese tech giant Alibaba on Thursday announced its own AI model, challenging upstart DeepSeek as well as OpenAI, raising questions about whether the AI boom in the US is worth the money that is being poured into it. Thursday’s decline is a reversal of the rally on Wednesday afternoon, highlighting that investors lack clarity and confidence about the next developments in the brewing trade war between the US and its biggest trading partners. “For now, tariff-induced inflation amid slower growth could bring the economy dangerously close to stagflation,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note Wednesday. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength relative to six other currencies, fell to its lowest level since November — signaling a weakening outlook for US economic growth. Investors will be closely attuned to the government’s monthly jobs report Friday, set to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET. and giving investors more insight into how the economy is doing. “I think if we see the hard data start to come in much weaker, that’ll become more and more concerning for the market,” said Haworth. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving investors for the past week, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.

"March has been a dizzying month for US markets. The S&P 500 just posted two days of back-to-back gains, but the benchmark index is still down almost 5% this month. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements have roiled markets and sent US stocks bouncing all over the place. While the uncertainty on Wall Street can be unsettling, selling your stocks in panic would likely only make it worse. Although recent market swings can be daunting, market volatility is more normal than you’d think, according to Jeff Buchbinder, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. “Volatility is like a toll investors pay on the road to attractive long-term returns,” Buchbinder said in a recent note. The last thing you want to do is “panic sell.” Volatility is a short-term feature of markets. So, too, are so-called corrections, when stocks fall 10% from their most recent high. Historically, the US stock market has climbed higher in the long term, smoothing out kinks and rewarding investors who stayed in the market. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday told NBC News that he was “not at all” worried about recent drops in the stock market. “I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy,” Bessent said. “They’re normal. What’s not healthy is straight up.” Still, seeing your retirement account take a hit can be unnerving, especially given the whiplash of recent market swings. But if you’re investing for retirement or long-term financial goals, the best thing to do during moments of uncertainty is to keep calm and tune out the noise. Related article
      Wall Street is turning its back on Trump and flashing an economic warning “Reacting emotionally to the markets can wreck your returns,” said Jon Ulin, a certified financial planner and chief executive at Ulin & Co. Wealth Management. “Panic selling often means locking in losses and missing the best rebound days,” Ulin said. A core tenet of investing is that no one can really “time” the market. Swings can be so unpredictable that staying invested is a better strategy than selling and trying to pick the best opportunity to get back into a fund or stock you sold. People who sell when times are tough tend to lose out in the long run. “Protecting your portfolio isn’t about timing the market — it’s about time in the market with a strategy that can withstand the storm,” Ulin said. What’s going on with markets? If you’ve checked your retirement account and felt unsettled — you’re likely not alone. The S&P 500’s performance from Trump’s inauguration to March 7, or 46 days into his second term, was the index’s worst start to a presidency since President Barack Obama’s first term, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Trump’s whipsawing tariff proposals are the primary reason for the markets’ rollercoaster ride, because they have created an environment of uncertainty. US stocks have slid amid the ensuing economic chaos, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite largely erasing their gains since the election. The benchmark S&P 500 last week closed down 10% from its record high reached on February 19, its first correction since October 2023. Nonetheless, it’s important to recognize that market downturns are normal occurrences. The S&P 500 on average has three drops between 5% and 10% each year, according to Buchbinder. Stocks on average see one correction a year, according to Buchbinder. Before the S&P 500 closed in correction territory last week, it had been over a year since its last correction. If you’re planning to hold your investments long term, such drops in one year don’t necessarily matter. Heading into this year, US stocks had been at record highs, with some strategists questioning whether they were overvalued. The S&P 500 posted back-to-back gains of more than 20% in 2023 and 2024 — a feat not achieved since President Bill Clinton was in office in the 1990s. After those sky-high gains, investors were already uncertain whether the good times would last. Big tech stocks that propped up the S&P 500 in 2024 have sputtered this year. While downturns are frustrating, they also present opportunities to “buy the dip” and purchase stocks while they are cheaper. “Encouragingly, history hints (but does not guarantee) that quick drops below the 10% decline threshold typically resulted in shorter and shallower total declines, followed by more rapid recoveries,” Stovall said in a note Monday. “Unfortunately, the greatest uncertainty surrounding this decline and possible recovery is that its major headwind — the tariff tiff — appears far from over,” Stovall added. Diversification is key to weathering the storm While markets face continued tariff uncertainty, it can be helpful to return to investing 101. A portfolio that is well-diversified across different types of stocks and bonds can help you mitigate losses during market swings. That becomes especially apparent during times of heightened volatility. “Spreading risk across different asset classes, sectors and regions is investing 101,” Ulin said. “Think of diversification as your portfolio’s seatbelt, keeping you secure when markets hit rough air.” If your portfolio is overexposed to US stocks, it might be smart to consider buying stocks in global markets like Europe and to further diversify by investing in Treasury bonds. Diversification might also look like investing in stocks in industries that have less exposure to tariffs, or “tariff-proofing” your portfolio, Ulin said. As with all things in investing, there is no one-size-fits-all. Each person has their own unique financial goals and tolerance for risk. Related article
      Market losses early in retirement can increase your risk of outliving your money. But you can take steps to mitigate that Periods of volatility present opportunities to reflect on whether or not your investments still align with your financial goals, according to Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. That means reviewing your investing goals and reassessing whether you’re well situated to pay for big-ticket items you might have coming up, whether you have enough cash for emergencies and whether there are new opportunities to buy stocks given the recent declines. If you are closer to retirement, you might consider parking more cash in Treasury bills or other cash-equivalent assets, as one of the most essential steps to take is to try and minimize sequence risk. The bottom line: Volatility — though unnerving — is normal. Keep a level head and look for opportunities to diversify and bolster your portfolio. “Regularly review your asset allocation, rebalance when needed and tune out the noise,” Ulin said. “Long-term success is built on discipline, not panic.”",,0.20708109438419342
"On-again, off-again tariffs, mass government layoffs, funding cuts and immigration crackdowns have seriously spooked Wall Street, which is emphatically rejecting President Donald Trump’s chaotic economic agenda. The market that embraced Trump for most of his first term and in the lead-up to his second has turned on the president. The S&P 500 closed in correction territory Thursday, falling 10% from the all-time high it set just three weeks ago. The Dow is approaching correction too. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell into a correction more than a week ago. And the Russell 2000, made up of smaller businesses, which are typically more exposed to shifting economic winds, has fallen a stunning 18.4% from a high hit just after the election, which was within a whisker of its all-time record. Even as stocks bounced back Friday — the Dow rose 600 points, or 1.4%, the S&P 500 was 1.9% higher and the Nasdaq was up 2.4% — sentiment on Wall Street has been overwhelmingly negative, and stocks are still poised for losses this week. CNN’s Fear and Greed Index has plunged into “Extreme Fear.” “The stock market is losing its confidence in the Trump 2.0 policies,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Instead, investors have poured money into traditional safe havens like government bonds and gold. Treasury yields, which trade in the opposite direction to prices, have tumbled over the past month. And spot gold prices on Friday hit $3,000 a troy ounce for the first time in history. Traders have grown increasingly concerned that Trump’s policies could inflict serious damage on the economy. Despite Trump’s insistence that stocks are falling because of the inflationary problems inherited from former President Joe Biden, the market had boomed after Trump’s November election in hopes that his promised tax cuts and deregulation would fuel another economic boom. But Trump in the months before he took office began threatening massive tariffs on America’s biggest trading partners. The Dow, which was near its record high when Trump started posting messages on Truth Social about tariffs on November 25, hit one more record high a week later but has fallen nearly 10% since. Russell 2000 never recovered. Gold surging is among several signs that investors are concerned about America’s economic outlook, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNN on Friday. “It’s a sign of the amount of uncertainty that’s being created that amidst everything else, the asset that’s done well is gold,” Summers told CNN’s Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer. “That’s what people do when they don’t have confidence in the people who are managing the country.” Meanwhile, problems are growing for the economy, and Trump’s policies could exacerbate them. On Friday, a University of Michigan consumer sentiment report plunged to its lowest level since the height of the inflation crisis in 2022. Consumer confidence in February registered its biggest monthly decline since August 2021 and fell the most in the first two months of any year since 2009, according to the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index. Consumers aren’t spending as much as they used to, as concerns about the economy weigh on their purchasing decisions. Target, Walmart, Delta Air Lines, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Dollar General and Kohl’s said in their most recent earnings reports that tariffs and inflation are leading people to spend less. “This market is just blatantly sick and tired of the back and forth on trade policy,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. “It feels as though the administration continues to move the goal posts. With that much uncertainty, it’s impossible for investors to have any confidence.” Trump acknowledged tariffs could cause a “disturbance” and has declined to rule out a recession, saying his economic plan could be painful for some at first. Mainstream economists, however, believe Trump may be underplaying how damaging his policies could be. Uncertainty about tariffs is paralyzing businesses who are unsure whether to hire and invest. Mass layoffs of federal workers could seriously damage local economies. And immigration crackdowns could badly hurt the already labor-sapped health care, construction and agriculture industries. JPMorgan economists alarmingly wrote last week that the US economy now has a 40% chance of falling into a recession this year. That’s up from 30% forecast by JPMorgan at the start of the year. The bank cited a “less business-friendly stance” from US policy, including a more aggressive trade war than feared, as well as “aggressive efforts” by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal hiring and spending. “We see a material risk that the US falls into recession this year owing to extreme US policies,” JPMorgan economists wrote in a note to clients last Friday. Suddenly ignoring the market Trump has been noticeably quiet about stocks lately. During his first term he routinely tweeted about market records as a sign of America’s economic might. Visiting the New York Stock Exchange as recently as December 12, Trump called the stock market “very important” in an interview with CNBC. “The stock market is very — all of it, you know, all of it together, it’s very important,” Trump said. “I sort of joked that I actually bought the building across the street because the stock exchange was here. It’s a big deal.” But he has changed his tune as stocks first erased their post-inauguration gains and then their post-election gains. “You can’t really watch the stock market,” Trump said Sunday in an interview with Fox. “Markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down,” he said in the Oval Office Tuesday. “I think a lot of the stock market going down was because of the really bad four years that we had, when you look at inflation and all of the other problems, I mean wars and inflation and so many other problems,” Trump said Wednesday at the White House. But Wall Street doesn’t like being ignored – it’s trying to send the president a message. And it’s a painful one. Tumbling markets can pose a problem in and of themselves. Seeing markets in the red can sap consumers’ confidence, because many Americans incorrectly believe the Dow Jones serves as a barometer for the health of the US economy. But many people also rely on stocks for their retirement funds, and watching stocks sink sharply gives them pause about their financial position. “Obviously the stock market can have a significant negative wealth effect if it continues to take a dive,” Yardeni said. “Trump is going to have to rethink his notion that it’s okay to let the market go down while he is experimenting with tariffs and slashing federal payrolls.” Investors feel Trump has turned his back on them. Now they are turning their back on him. CNN’s Matt Egan and John Towfighi contributed to this report.",,0.2626682221889496
"Gold prices reached $3,000 an ounce for the first time in history Friday, boosted by demand for safe-haven assets as investors fret about President Donald Trump’s tariffs and geopolitics. Prices hit a record $3,005 before paring those gains a bit to just under $3,000. Jason Hollands, managing director at Evelyn Partners, a UK wealth manager, described the yellow metal as “the panic asset of choice” and said the latest rise in prices reflected “the extreme uncertainty facing the global trade system at the moment from the Trump administration’s erratic and aggressive approach to tariffs and corresponding retaliatory measures.” The surging price of gold is among several signs that investors are concerned about America’s economic outlook, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNN on Friday. “It’s a sign of the amount of uncertainty that’s being created that amidst everything else, the asset that’s done well is gold,” Summers told CNN’s Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer. “That’s what people do when they don’t have confidence in the people who are managing the country.” On Wednesday, 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imported into the United States became the latest Trump 2.0 duties to come into force, triggering swift countermeasures from Canada and the European Union. Trump then massively upped the ante Thursday by threatening to slap a 200% tariff on alcoholic beverages from the EU unless it rescinded the 50% tariff imposed on US spirits the day before. His administration’s trade policy has also been marked by flip-flopping and delays, with the resulting uncertainty paralyzing businesses, which are unsure whether to hire and invest. Related article
      The world’s second-largest gold storage suddenly has very long lines to withdraw bars It is all adding up to growing worries about a possible economic slowdown globally. The war in Ukraine is another factor in gold’s reign. “Russia’s rejection of the US-proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine has reignited geopolitical instability,” said Viktoria Kuszak, a research analyst at Sucden Financial, a trading firm. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin questioned the US-brokered proposal, setting forth tough conditions and demanding concessions from Kyiv despite saying he supported a truce in theory. The drawn-out war has underpinned gold prices over the longer term, too. Trevor Greetham, a senior investor at Royal London Asset Management, noted that prices were now up about 60% since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. “Central banks, including the People’s Bank of China, have been adding to their (gold) stockpiles rather than risk having foreign reserves seized, as happened to Russia,” he said. Yet another tailwind for gold prices is a recent weakening of the dollar, said Hollands at Evelyn Partners. Gold is priced in dollars, so a weaker greenback has made the metal more appealing to buyers outside of the US.",,0.18743960559368134
"What a week it’s been. US stocks surged Friday but all three major indexes still closed the week in the red. President Donald Trump’s budding trade war has sent jitters through markets that caused a volatile week on Wall Street. The Dow ended the day higher by 675 points, or 1.65%. The broader S&P 500 rose 2.13% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.61%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallied Friday to notch their best single-day gains since the US presidential election. Yet it wasn’t enough to drag the indexes out of the red for this week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their fourth consecutive week in the red, which is their worst losing streak in seven months. Despite the Friday rally, the blue-chip Dow closed down roughly 3.1% this week and posted its worst week since March 2023. Friday’s rebound in stocks came after a steep decline on Thursday that saw the S&P 500 close in correction territory, down more than 10% from its recent high, for the first time since late 2023. The benchmark index shed roughly $5.28 trillion in market value from its peak on February 19 to market close on March 13, according to FactSet data. US stocks rallied on the news that lawmakers would likely pass a government funding plan Friday, avoiding a shutdown. Markets hate uncertainty, and hopes of dodging a shutdown provided a boost for stocks at the end of a turbulent week. Trump’s tariffs have roiled markets this month, and recent drawdowns can also present opportunities for rebounds. “The markets are grappling with the notion of where fair value rests for a stock market that faces headwinds from tariffs, fiscal spending cuts and potentially softening economic data,” said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, in an email. Ma said he expects a “multi-day relief rally could be coming soon” due to how much negative investor sentiment has built up recently. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving markets since the end of February, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. All three major indexes opened higher Friday and held on to their gains despite a fresh read on consumer sentiment that showed Americans are souring on the economy. Consumer sentiment fell 11% this month to a reading of 57.9, a preliminary reading showed, down from last month’s reading of 64.7 and reaching its lowest level since November 2022, according to the latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan. Stocks driving markets higher on Friday included tech and AI stars like Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) that rebounded after a slide in the past month. Tesla (TSLA), which had plunged earlier in the week, gained 3.86% on Friday after gaining 3% on Thursday. Gold soars on tariff uncertainty Gold on Friday surged to a record high, breaking through $3,000 a troy ounce. Gold prices have soared as investors demand safe havens amid uncertainty around the impact of Trump’s tariffs on global economic growth and geopolitical stability. The skyrocketing price of gold is among several signs that investors are concerned about America’s economic outlook, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNN on Friday. Related article
      Gold prices hit $3,000 for the first time as investors push the panic button “It’s a sign of the amount of uncertainty that’s being created that amidst everything else, the asset that’s done well is gold,” Summers told CNN’s Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer. “That’s what people do when they don’t have confidence in the people who are managing the country.” Gold prices rallied 27% in 2024, smashing through previous record highs. In addition to investor demand, central banks — led by China — have been increasing their gold reserves, pushing prices higher. Russia’s war in Ukraine is another factor contributing to higher gold prices. “Russia’s rejection of the US-proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine has reignited geopolitical instability,” said Viktoria Kuszak, a research analyst at Sucden Financial, a trading firm.

"US stocks slid Thursday and the S&P 500 closed in correction, down more than 10% from its record high in February, as President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on the European Union. The Dow ended the day down by 537 points, or 1.3%. The S&P 500 fell 1.39% and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.96% lower. The selloff extends a rout in US markets that has been driven by the uncertainty around Trump’s tariff announcements. The Nasdaq entered correction territory last week, and as of Thursday closed down 14.2% from its record high in December. The S&P 500 closed at 5,521.52, down 10.1% from its record high of 6,144.15 on February 19 and notching its first correction in over a year. Correction is a Wall Street term for falling more than 10% from a recent high. The last correction to the S&P 500 occurred in October 2023, when the benchmark index closed down 10.3% from its recent high that July, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. That correction took 24 days to recover from, Turnquist said. Trump on Thursday threatened to impose a 200% tariff on alcoholic beverages from the European Union after the bloc on Wednesday imposed a 50% tariff on US spirits like bourbon. The EU’s tariff on US spirits was in retaliation for Trump’s sweeping 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Cooling inflation data and a slight rebound in tech stocks had helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq close higher Wednesday, but they slid Thursday as the trade tensions between Washington and Brussels escalated. Turnquist said drawdowns are “nothing out of the ordinary,” but noted the recent drop in stocks has been “painful” because it’s been just three weeks since the S&P 500 hit a record high on February 19. “In only a few weeks, the broader market has gone from record highs to correction territory,” Turnquist said in a note Thursday. “Tariff uncertainty has captured most of the blame for the selling pressure and is exacerbating economic growth concerns.” The White House doubles down on tariffs Trump indicated Thursday that he is “not going to bend” on the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, vowing that any resulting economic disruption “won’t be very long.” “No, I’m not going to bend at all aluminum or steel or cars. We’re not going to bend. We’ve been ripped off as a country for many, many years,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. Related article
      How Trump’s trade war could quickly spiral out of control Markets dipped to their lowest level of the day after Trump’s remarks. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC that he is not concerned about “a little bit of volatility over three weeks.” Bessent said the Trump administration is focused on the “real economy” and the outlook for the long term. Stocks initially wavered Thursday morning after the latest producer price index data showed inflation rose 3.2% year-over-year in February, a sharp slowdown from January. That came on the heels of consumer price index data Wednesday that also showed inflation slowed more than expected in February. While the cooling inflation report was reassuring for investors, the budding trade war between the US and its biggest trading partners and allies has sent jitters through US stocks. “Thursday’s inflation data is backward looking, and the real worry is the inflationary effects that may come from tariffs, which is a wildcard for markets and the Federal Reserve,” said Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged this week to its highest level since December. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving markets since the end of February, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. “The last month has been a brutal sell-off for tech stocks and the overall market as every day (every hour) there is some newsflow coming out of the Trump White House that is changing the rules of the investing game from tariffs to chips to investments to policy changes among many others,” said Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a note Wednesday.

"US stocks tumbled Friday and a broad selloff gripped Wall Street as investors digested slightly stubborn inflation data and weakening consumer sentiment while wrestling with continued tariff anxiety. The Dow tumbled and closed lower by 716 points, or 1.7%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.97% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.7%. The slide on Friday put all three major indexes in the red for this week. The S&P 500 is down more than 5% this year. The benchmark index is on track for its first losing quarter since September 2023 and its worst quarter since September 2022. US stocks opened the day lower and began to slide as data from the Commerce Department showed inflation in February remained slightly sticky. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index rose 2.5% year-over-year in February, unchanged from January and matching expectations. Yet the core PCE index, which strips out volatile categories like food and energy, ticked up to 2.8% year-over-year from 2.7% in January. That hotter-than-expected rise signals that inflation, while broadly cooling, remains above the Fed’s target of 2%. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment tanked 12% this month, according to the University of Michigan’s latest survey released Friday. The selloff gradually turned into a rout as investors dumped stocks in industries including technology, autos and airlines. Google (GOOG) slid 4.9%, Stellantis (STLA) slid 4% and Delta Air Lines (DAL) slid 5%. Lululemon (LULU) stock tumbled 14% on Friday after the company flagged concerns about the outlook for consumer spending on a call with investors. “We also believe the dynamic macro environment has contributed to a more cautious consumer,” said Calvin McDonald, chief executive at Lululemon. The selloff in major names wasn’t the only concern for investors. CoreWeave (CRWV), an AI venture backed by chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), had a disappointing debut on the Nasdaq Friday, offering a bleak outlook for both the prospects of a continued AI boom and the market for initial public offerings. CoreWeave had listed its IPO at $40, which was below its target range of $47 to $55, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, the stock began trading on Friday at $39, below that IPO price. The poor debut is a sign of cooling enthusiasm for AI as investors continue to debate whether the money being poured into the industry is worth it. It also offers a meager outlook for IPOs this year as markets struggle to look past headwinds from tariffs. Tariff anxiety continues to roil markets President Donald Trump’s tariff proposals have also clouded investor sentiment and stoked uncertainty on Wall Street. Investors continued to grapple with Trump’s announcement on Wednesday of 25% tariffs on all cars shipped into the US, set to go into effect April 3. Trump also announced tariffs on car parts like engines and transmissions, set to take effect “no later than May 3,” according to the proclamation he signed. Investors sold off stocks amid renewed anxiety about the impact of auto tariffs on the economy. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and economists expect Trump’s sweeping tariff proposals will cause an increase in consumer prices and drag on economic growth. “It’s natural for people to expect higher prices because we haven’t seen a trade war like this since McKinley,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN’s Matt Egan. Related article
      The truth about William McKinley, the ‘tariff king’ and Trump’s idol The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.26% as investors snapped up government bonds, highlighting a risk-averse sentiment amid tariff uncertainty. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged 16%. CNN’s Fear and Greed Index ticked into “extreme fear” territory, highlighting renewed anxiety among investors. The tariffs on autos are an escalation in a trade war with the US’ biggest trading partners, threatening to roil global markets and disrupt a deeply intertwined supply chain across North America. “While the economy appears solid, business executives are adopting a cautious stance on new investments, largely due to the Trump administration’s aggressive and unpredictable tariff policy,” said Matt Stephani, president of Cavanal Hill Investment Management, in an email. Trump’s decision to announce the tariffs on autos ahead of the April 2 deadline when reciprocal tariffs are set to be revealed — a date dubbed “Liberation Day” by the Trump administration — has caused unease in markets. The early announcement highlights Trump’s commitment to tariffs, testing some investors’ initial hope that they might only be a negotiating tactic. “We think the proposed tariffs as announced would deliver a big hit to the auto industry, stoking higher costs, higher prices and a sharp decline in US sales,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Thursday. “[The] question is what these very aggressive automotive tariffs signal for next week’s announcement on both reciprocal and ex-auto sector tariffs,” Marcelli added. Wall Street’s outlook sours Wall Street’s expectations for US stocks this year are being revised down amid continued announcements about tariffs. Analysts at UBS on Friday trimmed their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 6,400 from 6,600. Analysts at Barclays this week lowered their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,900 from 6,600. Goldman Sachs earlier this month lowered its year-end target to 6,200 from 6,500. Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, recently lowered his year-end target to 6,400 from 7,000. Meanwhile, the most actively traded gold futures contract in New York on Friday surged above a record high $3,100. Gold is considered a safe haven amid economic turmoil and a hedge against potential inflation. Goldman Sachs this week revised its year-end target for gold prices to $3,300, up from $3,100, underscoring how the yellow metal’s rise this year is expected to last amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",,0.2746135890483856
"The US stock market has been the gold standard for decades. But investors around the globe are growing increasingly nervous about the fallout from President Donald Trump’s economic agenda. That has sent traders in search of stocks in Europe and Asia. Wall Street has seen the largest drop in allocation to US stocks on record since data collection began in 1999, according to a Bank of America survey. Meanwhile, the survey showed the largest increase in allocation to European stocks since 2021. That’s in part because investors think US exceptionalism may have peaked, analysts at Bank of America wrote. After the benchmark S&P 500 soared over the past two years, some investors were already uncertain about prospects for another stand-out year. But now, Trump’s approach to trade and foreign policy is contributing to a broad shift in investors’ perception of the stability of US markets. “There seems to be a sea change in overall investor sentiment,” said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation. The Dow on Friday edged higher by 32 points, or 0.08%. The broader S&P 500 gained 0.08% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.52%. The end-of-day rally helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq snap a four-week losing streak. The S&P 500 is down about 4% this year, lagging indexes around the globe that have all gained, including in China, Europe and Mexico. The US outlook wavers as Europe stabilizes Markets crave certainty and stability, and the US outlook is increasingly at odds with that picture, said Peter Ricchiuti, senior professor of finance at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business. “The US has been [the place] everybody wanted to put money into,” he said. “And now it’s really upsetting the whole world in terms of clarity.” Recent data highlights that divergence: An index measuring US economic policy uncertainty by month spiked in March to its highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said in a statement that “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased.” Ricchiuti said investors might be concerned about the impact of Trump’s policies toward tariffs and immigration on US economic growth. Major US companies are also signaling turmoil ahead. FedEx (FDX) slid 6.4% Friday after the parcel company slashed its guidance and lowered its forecast for profits this year. “Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy,” said John Dietrich, chief financial officer at FedEx Corporation, in a statement. “While we expected President Trump to make tariffs a key pillar of his policy agenda, the sheer size of the tariffs, coupled with a haphazard implementation plan, has created market turmoil and made it difficult for companies to plan for the future,” analysts at Baird said in a Thursday note. While investors are grappling with unease in the outlook for the US economy, the picture in Europe has emerged as relatively stable from an investment perspective. The Trump administration’s shift on foreign policy toward Ukraine has been a catalyst for Europe to focus on defense spending, boosting European stocks. In Germany, political change has propelled hopes for an economic transformation. Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz was successful in pushing through a historic plan for increased defense spending, providing a boost to forecasts for economic growth. “While this is being done in reaction to US policies, it offers compelling economic benefits for Germany,” said Kristina Hooper, chief investment strategist at Invesco, in a recent note. Germany’s DAX index has soared 15% this year. “The question is whether the Trump policy that’s slightly more isolationist actually unlocks kind of a new regime for investing internationally,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird. A dent to US exceptionalism The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both fell into correction territory this month, down more than 10% from their record highs. The S&P has pulled back from correction territory but is down 7.8% from its record high. While Trump’s tariffs have rattled markets, other factors are underpinning the poor performance. The tech stocks that propelled the US market in 2024 are sputtering to start this year. Every “Magnificent Seven” tech stock except Meta (META) is in the red so far this year. Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) are all down more than 10% this year. Microsoft (MSFT) is down 7%. In January, DeepSeek’s AI model caught investors and Silicon Valley off guard and sent shockwaves through the US market, raising questions as to whether the AI boom was worth the money being poured into it. Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has been trying to cement its place as a staunch competitor to Elon Musk’s Tesla, whose share price has tumbled almost 40% this year. The Chinese government on March 16 also passed a “special action plan” to stimulate consumer spending in the economy in response to Trump’s tariffs. Stocks in China have surged this year. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has gained 18%. Stock performance is not reflective of the value of an economy on an absolute level, said TradeStation’s Russell. The US economy is still much stronger than Europe’s and wholly more reliable than China’s, and it’s long been foolish to bet against America. Yet the first few weeks of Trump’s second term have been a far cry from the pro-business boom investors expected when he was reelected in November.",,0.25142037868499756
"Gold isn’t the only metal smashing through record high prices. Copper prices in New York hit a record high on Wednesday after Bloomberg reported that President Donald Trump might impose tariffs on copper imports in the coming weeks. Wall Street had expected tariffs on copper to come later this year. The most actively traded copper futures contract in New York hit $5.374 per pound Wednesday morning before settling at a record $5.24 per pound. Copper prices have soared 30% this year, largely driven by US buyers trying to stockpile the red metal due to anxiety around potential tariffs. Copper prices have outpaced gold, which has gained 16%, and far outpaced the major US stock indexes this year. While tariffs on copper have yet to be announced, Trump signed an executive order last month to investigate the national security risks associated with importing copper. “Copper, a key industrial metal that has yet to be included in Trump’s widening catalogue of tariff-hit products, continues to rally on the assumption that it is just a matter of time,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, in a recent note. Copper is not a rare earth mineral nor one of the 50 “critical minerals” designated by the US Geological Survey. However, in 2023, the Department of Energy deemed it a “critical material for energy.” The malleable metal is widely used in construction and manufacturing and has essential purposes for electronics, energy and defense. The recent price spike in New York copper futures isn’t due to fundamental consumer demand, but rather “major stockpile shifts to the US” due to speculation around tariffs, according to Hansen.

      Trump’s tariff problem: He might need a third or fourth term for his plan to work In London, copper prices have also risen, though not to record highs. Since January, copper futures traded in New York have begun to outpace copper futures traded in London, breaking away from their trend of tracking each other. New York copper futures are now trading at a 17% premium, according to Hansen. “It highlights how tariffs continue to uproot normal market behavior,” he said. Commodities giant Mercuria estimates that about 500,000 tons of copper are being shipped to the US this month — a significant boost from the standard monthly import of about 70,000 tons, according to Bloomberg. “Front-running the potential tariff has unleashed a wave of near-term demand for copper housed in the US,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. “We think shipments to the US will likely be fast tracked,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a Wednesday note, adding that imports of copper in April could jump 200,000 tons. The analysts at Goldman Sachs said they had initially been expecting tariffs on copper to go into effect between September and November. Copper’s bull run While the recent surge in copper prices has primarily been driven by tariff anxiety, other factors have also underpinned copper’s rise over the past year. There has been increasing global demand for copper in energy and technology like electronic vehicles, as well as continued demand in China. The recent US stockpiles could leave the rest of the world with a smaller reserve, according to Hansen. The world is expected to meet only 70% of global copper demand by 2035, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency. Glencore, a commodities giant, suspended production at one of its copper smelters in Chile this month, creating a lull in supply that is also contributing to higher prices, according to Reuters. But despite all the uncertainty and speculation, Wall Street will ultimately have to wait and see what Trump’s actual policy is toward tariffs on copper. “There may be a price correction, at least temporarily, as soon as the pull-forward effect on US demand comes to an end,” analysts at Commerzbank said in a Tuesday note.",,0.19948072731494904
"As Wall Street heads into a new quarter, a flurry of President Donald Trump’s tariffs are set to go into effect. That has traders on edge and has helped put US stocks in their worst first-quarter slump in years. Wall Street has been rocked with volatility this year as Trump’s tariff proposals have kept investors in a cloud of uncertainty. The benchmark S&P 500 index is down 4.6% for the year, its worst start since 2022 and its worst quarter since September 2022. US stocks were mixed Monday as traders staged an afternoon rally. The Dow closed higher by 418 points, or 1%, reversing course after opening lower. The S&P 500 gained 0.55%. The benchmark index rebounded into the green in the afternoon after sliding as much as 1.65% Monday morning, briefly reentering correction territory and dropping to its lowest level since September. The Nasdaq slid 0.14%, paring losses after sliding 2.7% in morning trading and hitting its lowest level since September. While US stocks rebounded, stocks around the globe were lower Monday ahead of Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” this Wednesday when reciprocal tariffs in addition to others are set to be unveiled. Economists anticipate the sweeping tariffs could spur inflation and drag on economic growth. The full extent of Trump’s tariffs is yet to be seen, and the lack of clarity has weighed on Wall Street. Market strategists have been revising down their forecasts for US stocks amid heightened concerns about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the US economy. Analysts at Goldman Sachs on Sunday lowered their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,700 from 6,200. That comes after analysts at the bank earlier this month lowered their target to 6,200 from 6,500. Analysts at Barclays last week lowered their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,900 from 6,600. Meanwhile, analysts at UBS lowered their year-end target to 6,400 from 6,600. Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, on Sunday lowered his year-end target for the S&P 500 to 6,100 from 6,400. Yardeni earlier this month had lowered it to 6,400 from 7,000. Related article
      Recession odds are rising as Trump’s trade war escalates, Goldman Sachs says The economy faces a growing risk of a recession as tariffs could hinder growth, increase unemployment and contribute to inflation, according to Goldman Sachs. The bank on Sunday said it sees a 35% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 20% previously. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six foreign currencies, is down almost 4% this year, its worst start to any year since 2016. Oil prices surged after Trump on Sunday said he would put secondary tariffs on “all oil coming out of Russia” if a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war doesn’t come together and he thinks it was Russia’s fault. West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, surged 3% on Monday to hit $71.46 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, gained 2.68% to hit $74.71 a barrel. Gold surged to a fresh record high. The most actively traded gold futures contract in New York on Monday rose above a record high $3,150 a troy ounce. Gold is considered a safe haven amid economic turmoil and a hedge against inflation. The yellow metal is up almost 20% this year and on track for its best quarter since 1986, according to FactSet data. Tariffs have helped put stocks in a slump Heading into this year, US stocks had been at record highs, with some strategists questioning how much room was to left to rally. Analysts had expected Trump to usher in a pro-business boom, enabling the stock market to continue its historic run. However, Trump’s commitment to an economic agenda that prioritizes tariffs has left some investors perplexed. Trump has not given markets the same attention as he did in his first term, while investors have had to reckon with other factors on top of tariffs, such as debates over the value of the artificial intelligence boom. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 10.4% this year, posting its worst quarter since June 2022 and worst start to a year since 2020. As Wednesday approaches, investors are still uncertain about the extent of the tariffs — and businesses and consumers are bracing for impact. Trump on Saturday told NBC News that he “couldn’t care less” if automakers raise prices because of tariffs. Related article
      Trump says he ‘couldn’t care less’ if auto prices rise because of tariffs “The administration cites fairer trade relationships as the goal, with reciprocity the governing principle for implementing tariffs. But beyond that, little is known about what this policy will entail,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Monday note. “This isn’t exactly reassuring to investors we talk to, who are perplexed by the dynamic of tariff announcements, negotiations, delays and shifting levels of implementation for Mexico, Canada, China and some key products,” the analysts said. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to an intraday low of 4.2% as investors snapped up bonds before settling around 4.24%, slightly below its previous close, as stocks rallied. “The comments leading up to this are still a lot of mixed messages and so the uncertainty level is still high, and nobody really knows what to expect,” said Thomas Martin, a senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. “We’re going to get an announcement and and we’re still not going to have clarity. And I think that’s the main thing we’re going to be living with for a while,” Martin said. Global markets have similarly been shaken by Trump’s tariffs. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 tumbled more than 4% on Monday and closed in correction territory, down 10% for the first quarter. Taiwan’s benchmark index tumbled 4.2% and closed down 10% for this quarter. In Europe, the STOXX 600 index sank 1.5%. Germany’s DAX index fell 1.33%. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged higher Monday morning. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Monday, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. Markets in March were driven by “extreme fear” on 16 trading days, the most in any month over the past year. “Its all about the tariff uncertainty and how much tariffs and counter measures will be announced,” said Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, in a note Monday.",,0.29774510860443115
"Global markets on Thursday were severely rattled by President Donald Trump’s historic tariff announcement, which threatens to throw the US and the rest of the world into a recession. The Dow fell 1,679 points, or 3.98%. The broader S&P 500 was down by 4.84% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 5.97%. All three major indexes posted their biggest single-day drop since 2020. Global markets also fell sharply Thursday. Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index tumbled 2.57%, erasing its gains since January. Germany’s DAX index fell 3%. France’s benchmark index slumped 3.31%, its biggest single-day drop since July 2023. Italy’s benchmark index slumped 3.6%, its biggest single-day drop since March 2023. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index sank 2.77% and Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index fell 1.52%. The significant declines come after Trump’s massive tariffs imposed on practically all goods coming into the United States sparked fears that the new policy could trigger significant backlash from trading partners and take down the global economy. That’s part of the reason the US dollar fell to its weakest level since October on Thursday, wiping out its gains since Trump’s reelection in November. Tariffs in theory should boost the dollar, but investors’ concerns that the United States is creating a self-inflicted wound that would stymie its long-term growth sent the dollar sinking against other global currencies. “They’re ignoring every rule of classic micro and macro economics. This is the policymaking equivalent of a suicide bomber,” Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital, told CNN’s Matt Egan. Related live-story
      Stocks in major decline as Trump’s tariffs spark global trade war Treasury bond yields fell sharply after Trump’s announcement on Wednesday and continued to slide Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.05% Thursday, its lowest level since October. Bond yields and prices trade in opposite directions. Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services, said investors snapped up bonds because of concerns about “the drag that the policy uncertainty plus stricter tariffs will have on growth going forward.” Investors poured money into safe-haven assets. Gold surged to a new record Wednesday above $3,160 a troy ounce. Gold, which hovered above $3,100 a troy ounce Thursday, is up 19% this year and just posted its best quarter since 1986. The S&P 500 closed in correction, down 12.17% from its record high in February (a correction means down more than 10% from a recent high). The Nasdaq, which has been in correction, closed down 17.96% from its record high in December. The Dow closed down 9.93% from its record high in December, approaching correction territory. White House shrugs off market declines White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt during a CNN interview Thursday tried to calm investors’ worries about the impact of President Donald Trump‘s decision to impose tariffs of at least 10% across all countries. “To anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say trust in President Trump,” Leavitt said. “This is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first term.” Stocks leading US markets lower included companies that rely on international supply chains that will be subject tariffs. Apple (AAPL) sank 9.3%. Nike (NKE) tumbled 14.4%. Best Buy (BBY) plunged 17.8% and Ralph Lauren (RL) tanked 16.3%. Apple shed over $310 billion in market value from market close on Wednesday to market close on Thursday, according to FactSet data. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged 39.6% on Thursday. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. The Fear and Greed index slumped to its lowest level this year as tariff anxiety gripped investors. President Donald Trump shrugged off market reaction to his Wednesday tariffs announcement at the White House Thursday, telling reporters “I think it’s going very well.” “The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,” Trump said on the South Lawn. “And the rest of the world wants to see if there’s any way that they can make a deal, they’ve taken advantage of us for many many years, for many years we’ve been at the wrong side of the ball, and I tell you what, I think it’s going to be unbelievable.” Recession fears If Trump maintains the massive tariffs he announced Wednesday, his unprecedented trade policies will probably cause the US and global economies to both fall into a recession in 2025, JPMorgan analysts said in a note to investors. That’s not exactly a shock: Prior to Trump’s announcement Wednesday, JPMorgan analysts gave the US economy a 40% shot of entering a recession. Related live-story
      Trump launches historic global trade war JPMorgan noted that the tariffs would hike taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year — the largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot. It will cause prices to surge, too, adding 2% to the Consumer Price Index, a measure of US inflation that has struggled to come back down to earth in recent years. “The impact on inflation will be substantial,” the analysts said. “We view the full implementation of these policies as a substantial macro economic shock.” The shock will be exacerbated by plunging consumer and business sentiment and by any retaliation visited upon America as foreign countries potentially impose new tariffs on the United States. “We thus emphasize that these policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and global economy into recession this year,” the analysts said. Oil prices plunged on Thursday on worries that Trump’s trade war will slow the world economy and that OPEC is oversupplying the market. US oil futures settled at $66.95 a barrel, marking a 6.6% tumble. It was the biggest one-day decline for crude since July 2022. Brent crude, the world benchmark, plunged 6.4% — the biggest one-day drop since August 2022 — to finish the day at $70.14 a barrel. OPEC+ surprised investors on Thursday by announcing that Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members have agreed to sharply accelerate previously scheduled production increases starting in May. Businesses brace for impact The Business Roundtable, a powerful group of America’s leading CEOs, warned Wednesday night that Trump’s latest tariffs could backfire on their businesses. “Universal tariffs ranging from 10-50% run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters,” Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten said in a statement. “Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.” Trump’s massive new tariffs would send the US tariffs rate dramatically higher to levels unseen since around 1910, according to Fitch Ratings. Trump’s aggressive tariff moves are set to lift the US tariffs rate from just 2.5% last year to 22%, according to Fitch. That surpasses the roughly 20% tariff rate the United States charged following the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which set off a global trade war that economists say worsened the Great Depression. “This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy,” Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, wrote in a statement on Wednesday. Sonola said “many” nations will likely plunge into recession. “You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time,” the Fitch economist said. CNN’s DJ Judd, Shania Shelton, Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed to this report.",,0.24702294170856476
"President Donald Trump warned Americans in 2024 that a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris would be a vote for a market meltdown. “You want to see a market crash? If we lost this election, I think the market would go down the tubes,” Trump said at a Pennsylvania rally in late October. Weeks earlier, Trump confidently predicted that if he lost, “the result will be a Kamala economic crash, a 1929-style depression.” Trump won the election, but he may have been right about a crash occurring after the election. Trump and his tariffs have taken a bull stock market and are on the precipice of turning it into a bear faster than any president has overseen in modern history. If the stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration a bull market has turned into a bear in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957. These same tariffs may also take a booming economy and turn it into a recession. The S&P 500 had lost 15% of its value since Inauguration Day as of Sunday night. And that doesn’t even count the massive losses set for Monday’s opening bell. The only similar drop for an elected president so quickly into his presidency was under George W. Bush in 2001. The next largest drop after Bush and Trump was Carter in early 1977. That decline was under 6%, to give you an idea of just how far the rabbit hole the market is right now. The current market wipeout hit a crescendo after Trump’s “Liberation Day” event, where he shocked and alarmed the business world by promising to increase tariffs at an unprecedented pace. Indeed, two-thirds of the 15% fall in the S&P 500 has been since Liberation Day. “Liberation Day has been followed by Annihilation Days in the stock market,” Ed Yardeni, of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. The awfulness of the past two days of trading were matched only by the 1987 crash, the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid crash of 2020. Of course, the recent market’s plunge alone isn’t all that’s unique about the current situation. What was happening before the plunge makes it particularly special. Bush took office with a market that was already in decline. As you read this article, it might be hard for some of you to remember or imagine that there was a stock market crash related to the internet. The bursting of the dot-com bubble plunged the caused the S&P 500 by to drop 10% in 2000. It would, therefore, be tough to say that Bush was responsible for the poor state of the market in April 2001. Trump, on the other hand, inherited a bull market. The S&P 500 gained 23% in 2024. Indeed, it is quite easy to say that Trump is directly responsible for the dive under his presidency given how much of it occurred since Liberation Day. We should note that the 15% drop under Trump in the S&P 500 does not qualify as a bear market yet. A bear market by most definitions requires a drop of 20% from a recent peak. The Nasdaq already crossed that threshold, however, closing in a bear market on Friday for the first time since 2022. The Russell 2000 is in a bear market, too. An economy in decline Of course, there is the matter of whether what happens on Wall Street affects or is at least representative of the larger economy. The answer to the first part of that sentence is probably “yes,” while the answer to the second part could very well be “yes,” too. Although some Trump officials have argued they are trying to help Main Street, even if it hurts Wall Street, it’s not easy to separate the two. This isn’t the early 1970s anymore when polling indicated that less than 25% of Americans were involved in the stock market. Those were the days before IRAs and 401(k)s. As of 2024, more than three-in-five Americans were involved in the market in some way per Gallup. “Wall Street is Main Street,” Yardeni said. “The two streets prosper and suffer together…Main Street owns lots of stocks in American corporations that are facing massive disruptions as a result of Trump Tariffs 2.0.” Moreover, David Kotok, co-founder of Cumberland Advisors, warned the Trump tariffs will act as a massive supply shock akin to the 1973-1974 oil price shock during the Yom Kippur War. “The Trump tariffs are a massive tax hike imposed as a sales tax on American consumers,” Kotok said. “Supply shocks mean higher inflation coupled with slow growth or recession, which is the worst of all worlds for the central bank.” While there isn’t one universally agreed upon definition of a recession, take a look at these odds: JPMorgan has raised the chance of a recession to 60%. It had previously been 40%. Goldman Sachs has raised it from 20% to 45%. HSBC puts it at 40%. We’ll see if the National Bureau of Economic Research calls a recession before the end of the year. They rely upon a host of metrics to make that determination. Another definition of a recession is if we have two consecutive quarters of decline in the real gross domestic product. We’ve already seen forecasts for real GDP plummet. Some forecasts have it falling below zero for quarter 1 of this year, and others have it barely staying positive. The last time real GDP had two consecutive negative quarters in the first year of an elected presidency after not having a recession the year before? 1953, as the United States was coming out of the Korean War. The only war Trump can point to if a recession does occur is the trade war he started. And to be clear all of this could become a nasty cycle. If the market becomes convinced a recession is on the way, stocks could fall further. RBC Capital Markets notes that the median loss for the S&P 500 during a recession is 27%. Confidence is a fragile thing and the steep market selloff could easily spook CEOs and consumers alike. The hole blown in Americans’ 401(k) plans and investment portfolios is so massive that it will be hard to ignore. And if consumers stop spending, all bets are off in this economy.",,0.25904425978660583
"US stocks mostly fell after an extremely volatile day Monday — tumbling, surging and then bouncing around in every direction, as traders searched for any sign that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could be negotiated or halted. Markets around the world had tumbled earlier in the day over concerns about how Trump’s sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie economic growth. US stocks opened the day in bear market territory but surged an hour later on rumors that the Trump administration may pause tariffs — perhaps for several months. That rumor turned out to be just that — a White House official called any suggestion that Trump would pause tariffs “fake news.” And despite signs that some trading partners, including the EU, might be willing to negotiate with Trump, the president dashed those detente hopes when he said he could slap another 50% tariff on China. And just like that, the Dow, which had risen nearly 900 points, was back down once again. After a roller coaster day, the Dow closed lower by 349 points, or 0.91%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.23%. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1% higher after fluctuating between gains and losses. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, on Monday closed at the highest level since the Covid pandemic as investors fretted over the market’s next move. The VIX surpassed an intraday level of 50 points midday Monday, a rare level associated with extreme volatility. The wild swings in markets underscore just how badly investors want Trump to put a pause on his trade war. US stocks surged off their lows on rumors of a pause on tariffs. However, that rebound proved fleeting as traders realized nothing official had been announced. “That was a good example of what would happen if we actually got some rational thought mixed in with the ignorant tariff policy,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN in a phone interview Monday. “The stock market vigilantes have spoken loudly that we need rational thought mixed in with this trade policy. And there is none so far.” Hogan added that oversold markets desperate for good news are subject to wild swings that can quickly reverse. The S&P 500 hit its low of the day at 9:43 a.m. ET and then surged on the rumor that Trump might pause tariffs, hitting its highest level of the day at 10:17 a.m. ET. In the span of just over 30 minutes, the S&P 500 surged 8.5%, a massive swing in markets. The benchmark index then shed its gains as the market came back down. “That was a monster move off the low,” Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading, told CNN. One of the positive swings Monday came when Ursula von der Leyen, a top European Union official, said the bloc is “ready to negotiate” with the United States, noting that it has offered to scrap tariffs on US industrial goods. But Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Monday afternoon that he is “not looking” at implementing a pause in enforcing the tariffs that he announced last week. “Well, we’re not looking at that. We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us,” Trump said. “And they’re going to be fair deals. And certain cases, they’re going to be paying substantial tariffs. They’ll be fair deals.” The volatility in markets went beyond just stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had slid below 4% at the end of last week, rose to 4.155% as investors sold off bonds. Yields and bond prices trade in opposite directions. Flirting with a bear At the open, the S&P 500 tumbled into bear market territory — a decline of 20% from its recent peak — before pulling back. The volatility in US stocks came after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe. Related video
      What is a bear market? Wall Street is coming off a rout in US stocks Thursday and Friday that saw the Nasdaq confirm it was in a bear market. Investors may be sensing a buying opportunity. With all the recent and rapid selling, stocks are getting cheap. Some stocks are trading at a historically inexpensive multiple of 15 times future earnings projections, according to James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research. That could help markets rebound if investors believe stocks are oversold. “We are getting close to a bottom,” said Demmert. “The fact that stocks have dropped so significantly in these deep intraday moves is a clear sign of indiscriminate and fear-based selling. When this happens, we tend to soon see significant rallies.” That could also muddy the message Wall Street has been trying to send to President Donald Trump. Market mayhem has potentially opened the door to some negotiation. If the stock market pulls back from its extensive declines, Trump may get the message that he can hold firm and weather the market storm, some market analysts said. ”We need this market to crash — to keep the pressure on the administration,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN in a stunning comment from a prominent market analyst. Yardeni noted to clients earlier in the day that “Liberation Day” has been followed by “Annihilation Days” in the stock market. World leaders discuss approach to tariffs As markets whipsawed Monday morning, Trump said in a social media post that he’s ready to slap new 50% tariffs on China following Beijing’s retaliatory duties announced last week, further escalating the global trade war that has rattled markets. Trump said the additional tariffs would take effect midweek if China doesn’t remove its 34% retaliatory tariff by Tuesday. He also said meetings China had requested would be cancelled, though he said other countries would begin negotiating on trade immediately. Across the Atlantic, von der Leyen, president of the EU’s executive arm, said the bloc was ready negotiate and offered to scrap its tariffs on industrial goods. Von der Leyen said the zero-tariff offer was made “long before” Trump’s latest tariff announcement and “repeatedly, for example, in the automotive sector.” She stressed that the EU has long gone “zero for zero with other countries that also have a strong automotive sector.” Related article
      Elon Musk hopes for ‘zero-tariff situation’ between US and EU At the same time, the EU is willing to play hardball: Although it would prefer to strike a “negotiated settlement,” the bloc is also “preparing a potential list (of US imports) for retaliation,” von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels. CNN’s Fear and Greed Index slumped to its lowest level this year as tariff anxiety roiled Wall Street. As stocks initially wavered Monday morning, Trump posted on social media that, “Countries from all over the World are talking to us.” Trump said, “Tough but fair parameters are being set,” and mentioned that he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Ishiba urged Trump in a call on Monday to reconsider the tariffs he imposed on Japan, according to a press statement from his office. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will lead United States negotiation with Japan on trade, Bessent announced on social media on Monday. Trump, for his part, has also tried to make the case that recession fears could be a good thing. For example, US oil prices plunged below $60 for the first time since April 2021 on fears that global demand will be sapped in an economic downturn. And Treasury yields have fallen as investors have poured money into the apparent safety of government bonds. That could lower some consumer rates pegged to Treasury yields, including mortgages, credit cards and auto loans – although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank was in no rush to lower rates. “Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,” Trump said in a social media post Monday morning. Tariff uncertainty roils global markets Trump and his tariffs have taken a bull stock market and are on the cusp of turning it into a bear faster than any president has overseen in modern history. It’s not just US markets that are taking a hit from Trump’s tariffs. Stocks around the world have declined as Trump’s tariffs rattle markets. Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index sank 4.5% on Monday. London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index dropped 4.38%. Germany’s DAX index sank 4.13%. Italy’s benchmark stock index tumbled 5.18%. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index plunged 7.83%. Hong Kong’s Hang Sang index plummeted 13.22%, its worst single trading day since 1997. Taiwan’s benchmark index sank 9.7%. The Shanghai Composite index fell 7.34% and the Shenzhen Composite index sank 9.66%. Among the reasons for the bearish sentiment is the uncertainty the Trump administration has created regarding its inconsistent messaging about whether tariffs would be open to negotiation.

      This is the stock market’s worst start to a presidential term in modern history On Wednesday, America will impose significantly higher “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries that have the highest trade imbalances with the United States. In a note to investors Sunday, Goldman Sachs said that if Trump followed through with those threats, it would surely plunge the US and global economies into a recession. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in an annual letter to shareholders Monday that Trump’s tariffs would raise prices and slow economic growth. In addition to baseline 10% universal tariffs that went into effect Saturday morning, Trump has also put in place tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum. He placed 25% tariffs on certain goods from Canada and Mexico. And more tariffs could be on their way: Tariffs on auto parts are set to go into effect no later than May 3. Meanwhile Trump has also threatened tariffs on lumber, pharmaceuticals, copper and microchips, among other products. Whether or not Trump follows through with those threats could be the determining factor in whether the economy plunges into a global downturn. If you ask Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trump isn’t bluffing. “The tariffs are coming. (Trump) announced it, and he wasn’t kidding,” Lutnick told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “The tariffs are coming. Of course they are.” CNN’s Kevin Liptak, James Frater and Christian Edwards contributed reporting.",,0.2516246438026428
"What was a massive rally on Wall Street turned into yet another sizeable decline. Cheap stocks and hope for signs of trade negotiation sent markets surging Tuesday morning — but that relief rally evaporated as the White House said it would levy enormous tariffs on China. US stocks tumbled solidly into the red in the afternoon. The Dow fell 320 points, or 0.84%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.57%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.15%. The S&P 500 closed at its lowest level in almost a year. The Dow and Nasdaq both closed at their lowest level since January 2024. Markets fell because President Donald Trump is set to impose an additional 84% in levies across all Chinese imports on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Tuesday. That will mean all goods from the country are subject to a tariff of at least 104%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, which had surged as much as 4% and 4.5%, respectively, Tuesday morning, tumbled midday as Leavitt spoke to reporters. The loss for the Dow comes after the blue-chip index surged as much as 3.85% on Tuesday morning. At its lowest point of the day, the S&P 500 briefly dipped into bear market territory (down 20% from its record high in February) before pulling back and closing down 18.9% from that peak. It’s the second day in a row the S&P 500 has flirted with bear territory. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq, firmly in a bear market since Friday, closed down 24.3% from its record high in December. The Dow closed down 16.4% from its record high in December. “We’re not anywhere out of the woods yet, and so that sort of tempers things,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX index, surged higher Tuesday after spiking to historic levels the past two sessions, reflecting jitters among traders. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. Wall Street was poised for a rally After markets plunged over the course of the past three trading sessions, Wall Street investors were looking for any excuse to catch their breath ahead of the planned tariff escalation at midnight — but Trump’s hefty tariffs on China were a reminder that reprieve can be fleeting. Over the course of the past few days, stock prices got absolutely hammered as Wall Street grew fearful that Trump’s tariff policy would plunge the US and global economies into a recession. After three days of market carnage, investors appeared to be seeking some buying opportunities. Related article
      What to do if the stock market’s big drop is getting to you One measure of the price-to-earnings ratio of S&P 500 companies closed below 17 Monday — historically cheap, giving investors a chance to scoop up stocks they believe might be oversold. “This is a very normal action and very technical in nature after a shock period,” said Truist’s Keith Lerner. “The market is extremely oversold, and markets don’t move in a linear fashion.” Lerner noted that historic market rebounds tend to be clustered in with massive declines, as investors with FOMO worry they could miss out on a rally. “In a period of uncertainty, each bit of new information is overextrapolated, which leads to wider-than-normal-swings,” Lerner added. That explains why a bit of fake news Monday that Trump was considering a tariffs pause — immediately batted down by the White House — sent stocks temporarily surging. That gave markets a taste for what could happen if some nations begin to make progress in negotiating lower tariffs. “Yesterday market players saw how the hint of ‘good news’ — in that case it was chatter about a pause in the Liberation Day tariffs — could rally markets by whole percentage points very quickly,” Michael Block of Third Seven Capital said in a note to investors. “Even though that proved to be all smoke, traders are now poised for the fire – that is, real news.” Markets were coiled for a rebound Investors have been on edge for any updates from the White House that might signal Trump is negotiating his trade policy. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday on Fox News that the administration is managing “a massive number of requests for negotiations” from nations and that Trump is prioritizing “two of our closest allies and trading partners,” Japan and South Korea. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump posted on social media that he had “a great call with the Acting President of South Korea.” On Monday, Trump spoke with Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who will be sending a team to visit Washington to negotiate a trade deal. “(Traders) are peeking around every corner looking for even the slightest whiff of a trade deal or movement on the tariff front,” said Jamie Cox, managing director at Harris Financial group. “The market is wound up for a face-ripping rally.” Across the Atlantic, The European Union’s executive arm said the bloc is prepared to negotiate with the United States over buying more of its liquefied natural gas. It’s a response to a grievance raised Trump, who has said the EU must buy around $350 billion worth of American LNG to compensate for the deficit the US has in goods trade with the bloc.

      US trade official defends Trump’s tariffs, says almost 50 countries approached him to ‘explore how to achieve reciprocity’ US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Tuesday during a routine hearing before the Senate Finance Committee that the administration is in talks with about 50 countries and that they’re trying to address some non-tariff related measures, such as foreign countries’ regulations that impede US exports. Greer reaffirmed that Trump’s massive reciprocal tariffs will go into effect Wednesday. “We will have the president’s plan go into effect, and we’re coupling that with immediate negotiations with our partners,” he said. High-stakes game of chicken Markets tried to rebound Tuesday before sliding. It’s a reminder that there’s no guarantee stocks will remain buoyant. After imposing across-the-board 10% tariffs on virtually all products coming into the United States Saturday, the Trump administration is set to impose significantly steeper levies still on dozens of countries. Those tariffs, which Trump has called “reciprocal,” although they are no such thing, amount to as much as 50% for a handful of countries. China’s Commerce Ministry on Tuesday said the country would “fight to the end” of the trade war and would continue to stand up to Trump. The escalating trade war between the two largest economies is turning into a high-stakes game of chicken. China has squashed deals that Trump wants — including a US company taking control of ports on both sides of the Panama Canal and a deal to sell TikTok to a US-based company. Both countries’ economies would be hurt in a trade war — and given the massive trade imbalance with the United States, China could very well be hurt worse. So investors hopeful for a deal may not get one. And if they don’t, a damaging trade war could bring down both economies — and markets along with them. Recession fears Any escalation of the trade war would probably lead to a US and global recession this year, multiple Wall Street banks have said over the course of the past week, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. That could continue to sap demand for stocks. Although the current bounce back may be short-lived, some in the Trump administration were already declaring victory. “It’s finding the bottom now. It’s finding the bottom now,” Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro said about the market Monday evening on Fox News. “It’s going to shift over and it’s going to be companies in the S&P 500 who are the first to produce here. Those are the ones going to lead to recovery. And it’s going to happen. Dow 50,000. I guarantee that and I guarantee no recession.” Navarro’s optimism wasn’t matched by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who warned in his annual letter to shareholders Monday that Trump’s tariffs would raise prices, slow the global economy and weaken America’s standing in the world by tearing up its alliances. Even some of Trump’s allies, including Elon Musk and Bill Ackman, have recently warned that tariffs are bad policy that rely on extremely flawed logic.

"US stocks were battered by a steep sell-off Friday after China retaliated against the United States for President Donald Trump’s tariffs in a tit-for-tat that escalates a global trade war. The Dow plunged by 2,231 points, or 5.5%. The broader S&P 500 was 5.97% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 5.82% lower. The Nasdaq closed in a bear market for the first time since 2022, down more than 20% from its record high in December. The Dow closed in correction, down more than 10% from its record high in December. It is the first time the Dow has closed in correction since March 7, 2022, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Dow posted its biggest back-to-back losses since March 2020, during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The S&P 500 shed $5.06 trillion in market value across the past two days, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The benchmark index, which entered correction Thursday, sank more than 10% over the past two days. Investors have been fearful that a dramatic escalation of a trade war could plunge the US and global economies into a recession. JPMorgan analysts said Thursday that America’s economy and the broader world economy both had a 60% chance of sinking into a recession this year. The analysts also said odds of a recession would rise if countries began to retaliate against the United States — and China did so Friday. Retaliation raises the risk of further escalation and could diminish hopes for negotiation. “Markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade,” said Matt Burdett, head of equities at Thornburg Investment Management. “The tariffs have injected a level of uncertainty and volatility we haven’t seen since the early days of the pandemic.” US stocks briefly rallied from their lowest point of the morning after Trump posted on social media that he had a “very productive call” with To Lam, the general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. “(Lam) told me that Vietnam wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S. I thanked him on behalf of our Country, and said I look forward to a meeting in the near future,” Trump said. Nike (NKE), which slumped Thursday, rallied 3%. Nike relies extensively on international supply chains and imports from Vietnam, where many of its factories are located. Yet stocks eventually slid to their lows of the day as investors grappled with the extent of Trump’s tariffs and the potential for a slowdown in economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during prepared remarks Friday that inflation could remain elevated because of Trump’s tariffs. “While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” said Powell, who spoke at an event just outside Washington, DC. “The size and duration of these effects remain uncertain.” Tariff anxiety roils Wall Street Investors Friday morning wrestled with tariff anxiety while also digesting fresh data that showed stronger-than-expected job growth in March. The US economy added 228,000 jobs in March, a significant increase from February’s revised gains of 117,000, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. While job growth beat expectations, tariff angst continues to drive market sentiment. “Unfortunately, the market is no longer focused on the jobs market and focused squarely on tariffs and trade wars as the US plays chicken with the rest of the world, potentially beginning a downward spiral into a worldwide recession,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management.

      The US economy added a stronger-than-expected 228,000 jobs in March Traders ditched risky stocks, especially tech companies whose products are manufactured overseas and could soon be subject to enormous tariffs. Apple (AAPL), which tumbled more than 9% Thursday, was down another 7.3% Friday. As stock futures tumbled ahead of the opening bell, Trump posted on social media, “To the many investors coming into the United States and investing massive amounts of money, my policies will never change. This is a great time to get rich, richer than ever before!!!” Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged 50%. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index, which slumped to its lowest level this year as investors braced for an escalating global trade war. And as investors sold stocks, they poured money into traditional safe havens, including government bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield, which briefly fell below 4% Thursday for the first time since October, fell firmly below 4% Friday as investors bought bonds to insulate themselves from a potential economic downturn. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Gold prices surged above $3,130 a troy ounce Friday morning, setting another record, before sliding to around $3,030. Gold has soared this year as investors seek out safe havens. Investors ditched other commodities, including oil, out of fear that the trade war could send the global economy into a recession. US oil, which plunged nearly 7% Thursday, tumbled another 7.4% to $61.99 a barrel. Brent oil futures, the global benchmark, fell 6.5%. Both US oil and the global benchmark settled at their lowest level since 2021. China retaliates against Trump’s tariffs China announced sweeping 34% tariffs on all US goods starting April 10, a major escalation of a trade war that has been raging for years between the world’s two largest economies. But the tit-for-tat tariff escalation kicked into high gear after Trump took office for the second time in January. Trump in February placed an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods imported to the US and doubled that rate to 20% in March. On Wednesday, Trump announced that tariffs on China would rise to 54%. That’s on top of existing import taxes, which he and former President Joe Biden already had in place on the country. So the effective tariff rate America imposes on Chinese goods will be well above 54% starting April 9. Markets have been on edge: The Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies, entered a bear market Thursday. Stocks tumbled all over the world Friday. Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index dropped 5.12%, and London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index fell 4.95%, both posting their biggest single-day declines since 2020. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 2.75% after falling 2.77% on Thursday. On Thursday, the Dow fell more than 1,600 points, or nearly 4%. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5% and the Nasdaq plunged nearly 6%. Each of the three major US indexes recorded its worst performance in about five years, since the Covid-19 pandemic. “This is just the tip of the spear. Next it’s going to be retaliation from the EU and other nations. Banks, airlines and other service sector firms are going to get targeted,” said RSM’s Joe Brusuelas. “The Chinese are calling Trump’s bluff.” UBS on Friday lowered its year-end target for the S&P to 5,800 from 6,400 and said the US economy could enter recession in the near-term due to the impact of Trump’s tariffs. “In the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without President Trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful US recession and lower equity markets,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Friday. Negotiations or more tariffs? Trump said Thursday after the market close that he was open to negotiation on trade. He cited TikTok as an example, hoping China would agree to a sale of the popular social media app to a potential US buyer in exchange for lower tariffs. “Every country has called us. That’s the beauty of what we do, we put ourselves in the driver’s seat,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Thursday. “As long as they are giving us something that’s good. For instance, with TikTok as an example, we have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say, ‘We’ll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariffs?’ The tariffs give us great power to negotiate. They always have.” Some countries say they’re in active negotiations with the United States to lower the tariff barriers Trump announced this week. The United Kingdom, for example, said it is in talks with the United States to strike an economic agreement, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said on Friday. But other countries chose to retaliate. Canada on Thursday announced retaliatory tariffs on some US-made cars. France’s finance minister said the European Union was not considering reciprocal tariffs to respond to the Trump administration’s tariffs, because they could hurt European consumers, but the EU could target individual US companies, Eric Lombard said in an interview Friday with CNN affiliate BFMTV. The New York Times on Thursday reported the EU was considering penalties against Tesla. Trump on Thursday dismissed the massive declines in the stock market, saying it’s “to be expected” and that the economy is in a “transition period.” He called the economy a “sick patient.” CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report.",,0.24753811955451965
"The US stock market tumbled deeply into the red on Thursday as the White House clarified its plan for a massive 145% tariff on China, escalating a trade war. The Dow, after rising nearly 3,000 points Wednesday, had a volatile day in the red on Thursday. The blue-chip index fell 1,015 points, or 2.5%, pulling back after tumbling as much as 2,100 points midday. The S&P 500 fell 3.46% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 4.31%. The S&P 500 was coming off its best day since 2008, and the Nasdaq on Wednesday posted its second-best daily gains in history. The stock market, fresh off its third-best day in modern history, is sinking back into reality: Although President Donald Trump paused most of his “reciprocal” tariffs, his other massive import taxes have already inflicted significant damage, and the economy won’t easily recover from the fallout. After taking a victory lap Wednesday, the president on Thursday acknowledged some “transition problems” could be expected. “A big day yesterday. There will always be transition difficulty — but in history, it was the biggest day in history, the markets. So we’re very, very happy with the way the country is running. We’re trying to get the world to treat us fairly,” Trump said in the Cabinet Room. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six foreign currencies, tumbled 1.7% Thursday, hitting its lowest level since early October. The dollar has broadly weakened this year, a sign of investors’ concern about the health and stability of the US economy. Gold prices hit a fresh record high above $3,170 a troy ounce on Thursday. The yellow metal is considered a safe haven amid economic and geopolitical turmoil and just posted its best quarter since 1986. Stocks are volatile after short-lived relief rally Traders were elated that Trump temporarily rescinded his so-called reciprocal tariffs, which aren’t really reciprocal, for 90 days. Those tariffs placed hefty levies between 11% and 50% on dozens of countries. Stock futures on Thursday had also responded somewhat positively to the European Union’s announcement that it would temporarily pause its retaliatory tariffs on the United States in hopes of a negotiated trade agreement after Trump’s U-turn. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said more than 70 countries were lining up to negotiate trade deals with the United States to get out from under the tariffs, and the Trump administration wanted to provide time to strike deals.

      Retiring in this market? Hear a financial planner’s top three tips But even after Trump’s about-face, the reality remains stark: Economists said the economic damage is done, and many say there is still an elevated risk of a US and global recession. Stocks are still well below where they were before Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs last week, and those large stock market losses, existing tariffs and high degree of uncertainty about American trade policy are enough to sink the economy, they say. Trump’s universal 10% tariff that went into effect Saturday remains in place, as do 25% tariffs on auto imports, 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum and 25% tariffs on some goods from Canada and Mexico. Trump also pledged to go forward with additional tariffs on pharmaceuticals, lumber, semiconductors and copper. Goldman Sachs said Wednesday after Trump’s partial detente that recession chances in the United States were still a coin flip. JPMorgan Wednesday evening said the bank would not alter its recession forecasts, still seeing a 60% chance of a US and global recession even after Trump’s “positive” decision to unwind his “draconian” country-specific tariffs. “My sense here is that the (US) economy is still likely to fall into recession, given the level of simultaneous shocks that it’s absorbed,” Joe Brusuelas, chief economist of consulting firm RSM, told CNN. “All this does is postpone temporarily what will likely be a series of punitive import taxes put on US trade allies.” The CBOE Volatility Index, or Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged 40% Thursday. The VIX briefly traded above 50 points midday — a rare level associated with extreme volatility. New data on Thursday showed that inflation in the US slowed sharply in March. While that is usually welcome news for investors, the focus on Wall Street is firmly on tariffs and the outlook for the economy going forward. “Thursday’s [data] is for March, which is backward looking and doesn’t tell the market much about how the recent tariffs, albeit many of them on pause, are affecting consumer prices,” said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. China’s not backing down Meanwhile, Trump isn’t backing off his alarming trade war with China — in fact, it’s getting worse. Goods coming from China to the United States are now subject to at least a 145% tariff, the White House clarified Thursday. The 125% “reciprocal” tariff Trump announced on China on Wednesday comes on top of the 20% tariff that had already been in place. It hadn’t been clear if the tariffs were additive. Stocks immediately dipped lower after news outlets began reporting the clarification around 11 a.m. ET. Also on Thursday, Beijing’s retaliatory 84% tariffs on US imports to China went into effect. China says it remains willing to negotiate with the United States, but a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry also reiterated Thursday that China will not back down if Trump chooses to further escalate the trade war. “The door to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and equality,” the spokesperson said. “We hope the US will meet China halfway, and work toward resolving differences through dialogue and consultation.” “If the US chooses confrontation, China will respond in kind. Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right ways to deal with China,” the spokesperson said. Signs of stress Some billionaire investors, who have been pressuring Trump to back off his punishing tariffs, were elated that the president hit pause. “There are better and worse ways of handling our problems with unsustainable debt and imbalances, and President Trump’s decision to step back from a worse way and negotiate how to deal with these imbalances is a much better way,” billionaire investor Ray Dalio said in a post on X late Wednesday, adding: “I hope… he will do the same with the Chinese.” But signs of stress remain in markets beyond just stocks. The bond market, which had been selling off alarmingly fast — the 10-year Treasury yield surged past 4.5% Wednesday from under 4% earlier in the week — has cooled off just a bit. Yields rise when bond prices fall. Related video
      Janet Yellen criticizes Trump’s economic policies in first TV interview since he took office But the 10-year yield was above 4.3% Thursday. That’s not exactly a vote of confidence. “Bonds are signaling that the pause is significant, yet not much has fundamentally changed,” said ING analysts in a note to investors Thursday. “Markets will not easily forget these episodes with wide market swings.” Oil prices also remained under pressure. US oil fell again Thursday to below $60 a barrel, near where oil was in April 2021. Prices had fallen dramatically below $57 a barrel Wednesday before recovering. Brent crude, the global benchmark, also fell 4% to around $63 a barrel. Still, global markets recovered sharply Thursday. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index finished more than 9% higher, while South Korea’s Kospi index was up 6.6%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index jumped 2.1%. Taiwan’s Taiex rose 9.3%. In Australia, the ASX 200 closed up 4.5%. European stocks surged after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen paused retaliatory tariffs and said she welcomes Trump’s move to pause his “reciprocal” tariffs. “It’s an important step towards stabilizing the global economy,” she said Thursday in a statement. “Clear, predictable conditions are essential for trade and supply chains to function.” Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index was 3.7% higher Thursday. France’s CAC index was up 3.8% and Germany’s DAX jumped 4.5%, while London’s FTSE 100 index rose 3%.

"US stocks skyrocketed higher after President Donald Trump announced that he authorized a 90-day pause on the “reciprocal” tariffs that had gone into effect Wednesday, with the exception of China. Wall Street had been on edge, looking for any sign that Trump might shift his approach to his punitive tariffs. So when Trump posted on social media that he authorized a pause on most reciprocal tariffs, investors were ready to dive in. US stocks immediately surged, posting a historic rally. The Dow skyrocketed 2,963 points, or 7.87%. The S&P 500 shot up 9.52%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 12.16%. In a massive turnaround, the S&P 500 posted its best day since October 2008. It was also the third-best day for the benchmark index since its modern-day version was formed in 1957. The Nasdaq posted its best day since January 2001 and its second-best day in its history. The Dow posted its best day in five years. “The market’s move upward is violent, and speaks to how badly the market was looking for clarity on this issue,” said Chris Brigati, chief investment officer at SWBC, an investment firm in San Antonio, Texas.

      Trump announces 90-day pause on ‘reciprocal’ tariffs with exception of China The positive shift was widespread. Nearly every single company in the S&P 500 rose, according to data from FactSet. Amazon (AMZN) rose 11.98%. Nike (NKE) gained 11.36%. Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) soared 26.14%, Delta Air Lines (DAL) surged 23.38% and American Airlines (AAL) surged 22.6%. On the Nasdaq, Apple (AAPL) surged 15.33%. Nvidia (NVDA) rose 18.72%. Palantir (PLTR) gained 19%. Tesla (TSLA) surged 22.69%. The S&P 500 is now up 12.86% from its nadir reached two days ago, but is still down more than 3.7% from its close on April 2, right before Trump initially announced his “reciprocal” tariffs. The Nasdaq is still 2.7% down from its close on April 2. Before the upward swing, the S&P 500 had been on the precipice of bear market territory, coming close to a stunningly rapid drop of 20% from the all-time high it hit just seven weeks ago on February 19. The S&P closed down 11.2% from its record high in February. Following Trump’s announcement, investors scooped up stocks and markets soared. Yet uncertainty remains as Trump still escalated the trade war with China, raising its tariff rates to 125% from 104%. Additionally, universal duties of 10% remain on all US imports alongside the targeted, sectoral tariffs on autos. Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief as markets rallied, but investors are not necessarily in the clear. “Trump illustrated to everyone in the market today how incredibly difficult it is to trade around his tariff regime, because he and only he knows when it ends,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. Just after the opening bell on Wednesday, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: “BE COOL!” and “This is a great time to buy!!!” In an exchange with CNN’s Alayna Treene on Wednesday, Trump declined to say if the markets were ultimately what prompted his reversal on tariffs. “The markets right now are extremely good,” he said. An enormous shift in markets US stocks initially had a mixed start to the day after China announced significant retaliation and the European Union announced countermeasures against Trump’s reciprocal tariffs that had gone into effect earlier in the day. However, markets surged after Trump announced that all countries — besides China — subjected to reciprocal tariff rates would see rates go back down to the universal 10% rate. China, an extreme outlier, now faces a US tariff of at least 125%, compounding the new tariffs with ones already in place. Trump touted the market reaction to the announcement in a hot-mic moment at the White House Wednesday that was captured by CNN pool. Trump, greeting lawmakers at a NASCAR event on the White House South Lawn, was approached by Wyoming Senator John Barrasso who told him: “You got the markets seeing your brilliance.” “Yeah, that’s up almost 7 (percentage) points, 2500 points, nobody’s ever heard of it. It’s gonna be a record,” Trump said in reply. Fear has gripped investors across the world as the escalating trade war threatens to throw the global and US economies into a recession this year. Businesses and consumers will end up footing tariff bills, and uncertainty has led to a slowdown in hiring and consumer spending. Earlier in the day, global markets had fallen. Japan’s Nikkei index closed 4% down, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng finished marginally higher. On Monday, the Hang Seng tanked in a 13% rout – the biggest daily decline for the index since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index headed into bear market territory on Wednesday, a decline of 20% from a recent peak, after the country announced $1.3 billion in emergency support measures for its auto industry as it seeks to mitigate the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs. The index closed down 1.7%, falling about 20% from a peak reached in July 2024. Markets in Taiwan also fell sharply. The Shanghai stock market closed more than 1% higher, an outlier in a sea of red in Asia on Wednesday. In Europe, the region’s benchmark STOXX 600 index fell 3.5%. France’s CAC index was down 3.34% and Germany’s DAX was 3% lower. London’s FTSE 100 index was 2.92% lower. Oil recovers, bonds are acting strangely US oil reversed course and gained Wednesday after tumbling earlier in the day. US oil gained 4.65% to $62.35 a barrel after it had tumbled as low as $57 a barrel. The global benchmark Brent crude gained 4.23% to $65.48 a barrel, reversing course after it had briefly fallen below $60 a barrel. Both had hit their lowest level since 2021 before surging higher after Trump’s announcement. Oil prices had plunged as investors feared a potential global recession could sap demand for travel, transportation and shipping — all of which require fuel. Investors have poured money into some traditional safe-havens, such as gold. Gold spot prices rose more than 3%. But, curiously, US Treasury yields have risen in recent days as investors have largely sold off bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield, which fell below 4% earlier in the week, is now above 4.3%. Bonds were volatile on Wednesday, with yields coming down slightly from their intraday high but settling above recent sessions. Bonds yields and prices trade in opposite directions. Typically, in times of crisis, investors pour money into longer-term bonds in hopes that the short-term market problems are solved in the long run. But the bond market, like the stock market, has been shaken by extreme volatility in recent days, and some investors are heading for the exits. Trump told reporters Wednesday he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days, appearing to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs. “I was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it’s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,” he said. Deutsche Bank analysts on Wednesday said the mass exodus from Treasury bonds may signal weakening demand for US-backed assets — traditionally viewed as the gold standard for safety, because it has the backing of the US government. But in a trade war, investors may be fearful that America could lose its special standing in the world — an opinion echoed by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in his shareholder letter earlier this week. And foreign governments negotiating with Trump on trade may threaten to sell off their massive Treasury hoards, hurting America’s ability to borrow money to pay for its significant budget deficit. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six foreign currencies, pared its losses after initially sliding on Wednesday. The dollar has broadly weakened this year — a potential warning sign about waning investor confidence in the United States. Elevated volatility The CBOE volatility index, also known as the “VIX” and Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” sank 35.75% after Trump’s announcement of a pause on most reciprocal tariffs, reflecting easing jitters among traders. The VIX Wednesday morning had briefly surpassed 50 points — a level associated with extreme volatility — before sinking in the afternoon to just above 33 points. The index had closed above 50 on Tuesday, a level reached only twice before this week: During the early stages of the Covid pandemic in March and April 2020 and the 2008-2009 financial crisis that brought on the so-called Great Recession. The VIX is perhaps the best-known measure of market sentiment. It measures expected price fluctuations or volatility in the S&P 500 Index options over the next 30 days. The VIX often surges on days when the broader market sinks — and rallies when stocks rise. But over time, the VIX tends to be lower in bull markets and higher when the bears are in control. Volatility works in both directions, and this week is a good example. The market bounced and tanked and surged as news — and even some fake news Monday — about Trump’s potential plans for tariffs made its way through Wall Street. While Trump’s announcement of a pause on most reciprocal tariffs was welcome news for investors, uncertainty lingers as a trade war with China looms. “The US and China are now locked into a trade war without either likely to back down at the moment,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown told CNN. “What you’re seeing in investors being extremely skittish which is why (there are) big fluctuations.” CNN’s DJ Judd, Kevin Liptak, Betsy Klein, Elisabeth Buchwald, James Frater and Christian Edwards contributed reporting",,0.31453680992126465
"Measles cases have surpassed 650 in an ongoing multistate outbreak, but federal funding cuts could threaten the response. “I think that we are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions,” Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday at a meeting of the agency’s vaccine advisers. Texas – the epicenter of the outbreak – has sent several requests to the CDC for resources, Sugerman said, as response costs grow. Related article
      Response to multistate measles outbreak hampered by unique set of challenges The CDC recently pulled back billions of dollars in Covid-19 pandemic-era grants that state and local health officials said were also being used to respond to other public health threats, like the measles outbreak. The US Department of Health and Human Services also announced sweeping layoffs two weeks ago, including an estimated 2,400 employees from the CDC. In light of these cuts, Dallas County, Texas, says it has had to cancel over 50 immunization clinics. In New Mexico – where at least 63 measles cases have been reported – some staff that was responsible for order vaccines and checking vaccination records had to be let go. The outbreak is spreading within Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and Sugerman said the same genotyping sequence of the virus has been found in cases in Kansas and across international borders in Ontario, Canada, and Chihuahua, Mexico. Texas is mobilizing its resources and moving staff from other areas and domains into the measles response area, Sugerman said. But local officials say resource limitations are taking a toll on public health workers and the health system. “We still have to be able to do all of our other public health work, so it does become a strain on the system,” said Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health. “Public health doesn’t have … a lot of duplication of staff, so … you’re asking a lot of staff to do additional work beyond their regular daily jobs. It just gets draining.” Experts say that the effects of these funding cuts will be felt beyond the measles outbreak. “Other types of care are going to be influenced by having to redirect these resources to the setting,” said Dr. Bryan Patenaude, an associate professor of health economics at Johns Hopkins University. “In situations of scarcity where you have limited funding available for health overall, that’s going to place more and more pressure on those other disease areas that really have nothing to do with measles.” Costs for each measles case History has showed that the costs associated with an outbreak can accumulate in a short amount of time. “Each measles case can be $30,000 to $50,000 for public health response work, and that adds up quite quickly,” Sugerman said Tuesday. This includes testing, laboratory work, contact tracing, vaccination efforts and health-care costs, according to Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist with UTHealth Houston.

      US measles cases are undercounted, experts say, but real numbers are proving hard to pin down Hospitalizations can also become quite expensive, she said. The outbreak has put 63 people in the hospital across Texas and New Mexico, with another hospitalization in Kansas. The cost is “going to depend on how severely ill the person is … how much treatment they need [and] how long they’re in the hospital,” Troisi said. Given the contagious nature of the airborne disease, measles cases in hospitals also require proper ventilation and isolation procedures, which add to costs. In addition to health-care and public health response, experts say there are a vast amount of indirect costs during an outbreak. For example, parents may need to take time off work to care for sick children, or there could be costs associated with transportation to and from facilities, Patenaude said. Measles can cause a variety of complications including ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis or death. It is especially dangerous for young and unvaccinated children. There have been several hospitalized cases of pneumonia and at least one case of neurological symptoms from measles during this outbreak, according to Covenant Hospital in Lubbock. “The more sick kids we see, it also increases the likelihood of seeing an additional death,” Wells said. There have been three deaths reported in this outbreak: two school-age children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico whose death is under investigation. They were all unvaccinated.",,0.21382559835910797
"President Donald Trump’s firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said. The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were “RIF’ed” — as in “reduction in force,” the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings. Related article
      Dramatic HHS cuts leave US ‘weaker as a nation,’ says top FDA vaccine official forced out under Kennedy “I suspect they RIF’ed offices that had the word ‘data’ or ‘statistics’ in them,” said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. “It was random, as far as we can tell.” Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team. The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines. The poverty guidelines are “needed by many people and programs,” said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. “If you’re thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,” he added. Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help. There’s a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January. Everyone in Ghertner’s office was told, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said. “There’s literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,” he said. “And because we’re all locked out of our computers, we can’t teach anyone how to calculate them.” Related article
      23 states, DC sue Trump administration over billions in lost public health funding ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired. “These workers were told they couldn’t come into their offices so there’s no transfer of knowledge,” said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. “They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.” HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE “as part of Secretary Kennedy’s vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,”  spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. “Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office” and “HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,” she said in a written response to KFF Health News. After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF’ed data analysis team, which had nine members. “The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,” he said. “Eighty million people will not be affected.” Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency’s lobby. The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee “and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.” Related article
      ‘The lives of individuals in the US are at stake,’ researchers warn after HHS cancels hundreds of vaccine grants Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues. ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies. “These HHS staffing cuts — 20,000 — obviously they are completely nuts,” Primus said. “These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There’s no rhyme or reasons to what they’re doing.” HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said. And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four. “If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn’t buy you the same,” he said, “but if the guidelines haven’t increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.” The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.

      The ripple effect of 10,000 HHS job cuts across U.S. As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility. Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level. One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility. Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration’s objectives. “We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,” the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” rubric. “Even if it didn’t align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.” KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",,0.23685361444950104
"President Donald Trump and his advisers said this was the plan all along: Scare the bejesus out of the world by announcing astronomically high tariffs, get countries to come to the negotiating table, and — with the exception of China — back away from the most punishing trade barriers as America works out new trade agreements around the globe. But Trump’s 90-day pause on his “reciprocal” tariffs that were never actually reciprocal gives his administration just three months to strike enormously complex trade deals with dozens of countries that it says are lining up to negotiate. Financial markets aren’t buying it. Stocks have whipsawed as volatility has spiked. And other markets, including oil, bonds and the dollar, are sending a clear message of deep skepticism that Trump will be able to pull this one off. Stocks Following another steep sell-off Thursday, stocks appeared calmer — for now — and posted strong gains Friday. Related article
      Wall Street is seeing right through the Trump 2.0 spin The Dow ended the day higher by 619 points, or 1.56%. The S&P 500 rose 1.81% and the Nasdaq was 2.06% higher. Markets were buoyed by Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins telling the Financial Times Friday that the central bank would step in to support financial markets if there were signs of distress. But stock market investors have been trading on a knife’s edge, and any announcement coming from the Trump administration on tariffs has the ability to send stocks surging or tumbling. For example, stocks plunged Thursday after the Trump administration clarified the math it had already used to set China’s massive 145% tariff. The street had believed the tariff was 125%. The Dow sank sharply, at one point falling more than 2,000 points. In the 129-year history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the index has closed higher or lower by at least 1,000 points just 31 times. Four of those times happened in the past week. The S&P 500 fell by just over 9% across the first week of April, its biggest one-week drop since March 2020. The benchmark index gained 5.7% this week, its biggest one-week gain since 2023. Despite Wednesday’s historic gain after Trump announced his detente, stocks remain well below where they were trading before the president presented his “Liberation Day” tariff plan on April 2. Bonds The bond market is acting weirdly. Typically, you’d expect bond prices to rise throughout periods of turmoil. US Treasuries are historically considered to be the safest of safe assets, backed up by the full faith and credit of the US government. But bonds aren’t rising — they’re falling. That’s largely because investors have lost faith in US trade policy, and they fear America could get hurt even worse than the countries Trump’s tariff policy is targeting. As JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday, Trump’s “America First” policy risks alienating its most important partners and the country’s special standing in the world. Related article
      The bond market is acting weird. It spooked Trump US Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, briefly surged on Friday above 4.5%. They were under 4% earlier in the week. That represents a massive move for the market. Higher yields could hurt America’s economy, as a number of consumer loans are closely tied to those rates. “The upward action in rates has been rapid in historical context and has provided no comfort to investors looking for havens in turbulent markets,” analysts at Citi said in a Friday note. US Treasuries were on track for their worst week since 2019, according to Bloomberg’s US Treasury total return index, when the New York Federal Reserve had to step in and purchase Treasuries to bring down a spike in yields caused by a liquidity crunch. “Current market conditions don’t require Fed intervention at this point, but Fed officials are likely monitoring market function closely,” said Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services. Dimon said Friday on an earnings call that he expects there will be a “kerfuffle” in the Treasury markets that would lead to the Federal Reserve intervening. “They’re not going to do it now … they’ll do it when they start to panic a little bit,” Dimon said. Oil The oil market has been trading like we’re going into a recession. Prices have tumbled over the course of the past couple of weeks as investors feared Trump’s trade policy could sap demand for travel, shipping and transportation — all of which require fuel. US oil on Friday morning fell below $60 a barrel, close to a four-year low, before recovering slightly. Brent, the global benchmark, was hovering around $63 a barrel, the lowest since April 2021, before also gaining slightly. Oil gained on Friday after US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters that the US could stop Iran’s oil exports as part of Trump’s negotiations over the nation’s nuclear program, according to Reuters. US oil settled up 2.4% at $61.50 a barrel. Brent rose 2.26% to $64.76 a barrel. Yet concerns remain about the impact of tariffs on economic growth and how a potential slowdown could disrupt demand for oil. Oil prices have served as a prime recession indicator in recent years. Prices tumbled after surging above $100 a barrel for the first time as the Great Recession took hold in 2008. And prices went negative for the first time during the pandemic as a glut of oil became so severe that traders were literally paying storage facilities to take the unwanted oil off their hands. Dollar The dollar on Friday tumbled to its lowest level in three years. That’s the opposite of what you’d expect when tariffs are put in place. Typically, tariffs raise the value of a local currency, because it encourages residents to purchase homemade goods instead of foreign options, stretching their money further in comparison to other currencies. But currency traders have sold off the dollar, because they believe America will bear the brunt of Trump’s trade war fallout and end up comparatively weaker than before tariffs were put in place. The dollar on Friday hit its lowest level against the euro since 2022. The dollar index — which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies — fell 0.9% Friday after tanking 2% Thursday, which was its worst single-day drop since 2022. Those are massive moves in currency trading world. “Investors and central banks are selling Treasuries and dollars due to a loss of confidence and credibility in American assets,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist RSM. “Financial chaos has its cost.” Meanwhile, gold prices surged above a record high $3,200 a troy ounce on Friday. Gold is up more than 23% this year and just posted its best quarter since 1986. The yellow metal is considered a safe haven amid economic and political uncertainty. Trade deals Despite financial markets casting enormous doubt that the Trump administration can salvage the opportunity it created for itself to strike bilateral trade agreements with all 150 countries around the world, the Trump administration remains optimistic. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that more than 70 countries have asked to meet with US representatives to strike a deal that could get them out from under the thumb of Trump’s punishing tariffs. Although the administration has provided few details of which countries it is negotiating with, it said it would favor allies like South Korea and Japan first. Related article
      Xi says China ‘not afraid’ as Beijing raises tariffs on US goods to 125% in latest escalation of trade war But trade deals are incredibly complex arrangements usually negotiated over the course of years, not months. And even if Trump were to negotiate trade with all those countries over a short period — whether full deals or letters of agreement that put a framework of a deal together — China, the world’s biggest exporter, remains the elephant in the room. US tariffs on China are now at at least 145% and China on Friday retaliated with 125% tariffs of its own. That will do enormous damage to the world’s two largest economies, and both sides have said they are not eager to back down. China has consistently said it is open to negotiations, but wants to do it in a way in which it will be respected. China has ignored America’s warnings not to raise its tariffs, according to a source familiar with the discussions. In the meantime, economists have been unmoved by Trump’s sudden change in tune. Although negotiated trade agreements would undoubtedly be good news for the economy, much of the damage has already been done, Wall Street economists have argued. And punishing 10% universal tariffs remain in place, as do 25% tariffs on autos, 25% tariffs on some goods from Mexico and Canada, and 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. That’s why JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs say the likelihood of the United States and the global economies going into a recession this year are basically a coin flip.

"After months without a meteor shower, sky-gazers now have a reason to keep their chins up — the Lyrids are here to kick off the season. The Lyrids have graced the sky since April 17 and will hang around until Saturday, with the densest concentration of meteors flying by Monday night into Tuesday, according to the American Meteor Society. In a perfectly dark sky, onlookers can typically spot up to 18 meteors per hour during the Lyrid shower’s peak. This year, however, light from the waning crescent moon will make it somewhat harder to see the celestial show. Still, local weather conditions allowing, careful observers in the Northern Hemisphere can expect around five streaking lights per hour appearing between 10 p.m. local time Monday and 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, said Dr. Bill Cooke, lead for NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office. “Most meteors you see (during a Lyrid shower) are not brilliant fireballs — they are faint little streaks — and the more moonlight there is, it tends to wash out those faint little streaks,” Cooke said. “Meteor observing is one of those things where you’re going to take your time.” For the optimal viewing experience, Cooke recommends lying down somewhere outside with minimal light pollution and giving your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness. “The other important thing is: Don’t look at your cell phone, because that bright screen destroys your night vision,” Cooke said. “And it takes your eyes off the sky.” Related article
      A new comet appeared in the sky, then likely disintegrated. But it can still be seen More about the Lyrids Regular meteor showers occur throughout the year as the Earth passes through a field of debris left by comets and asteroids, said Shannon Schmoll, director of Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University. The Lyrids originate from the parent comet C/1861 G1 (Thatcher), which is about halfway through its roughly 415-year orbit around the sun. While Comet Thatcher was discovered in 1861, the Lyrids have been observed for 2,700 years, making them one of the oldest known meteor showers, according to NASA. The best time to view the Lyrids is when Lyra, the Northern Hemisphere constellation from which the meteors appear to radiate, is above the horizon, according to EarthSky. What happens during a meteor shower? As the comet travels, it leaves a trail of ice and dust moving thousands of miles per hour in its wake, astronomer Dean Regas said. “The meteors hit the (Earth’s) atmosphere and slow down, and that transmits heat. That’s the flash you see,” Regas said. “Most of the material from meter showers, the comet pieces, will burn up before they hit the ground, and a lot of them are about the size of a grain of sand. So it’s really impressive to see something so small light up like that.” Related article
      ‘Another mind-blowing change’: New data suggests mysterious dark energy is evolving While the Lyrids tend to be relatively predictable each year, occasionally they exceed expectations. Outbursts of 100 meteors per hour occur unpredictably, averaging about every 60 years. The next outburst is expected around 2042, according to the American Meteor Society. It is not entirely known what causes these outbursts, but other planets and objects are thought to affect the density of the debris as they cross paths, Schmoll said. Other meteor showers to come If you miss the peak of the Lyrid shower, there’s still a chance to catch some shooting stars this year. Here are peak dates for upcoming meteor showers in 2025, according to the American Meteor Society and EarthSky. ●       Eta Aquariids: May 5–6 ●       Southern Delta Aquariids: July 29–30 ●       Alpha Capricornids: July 29–30 ●       Perseids: August 12–13 ●       Draconids: October 8–9 ●       Orionids: October 22–23 ●       Southern Taurids: November 3–4 ●       Northern Taurids: November 8–9 ●       Leonids: November 16–17 ●       Geminids: December 12–13 ●       Ursids: December 21–22 Full moons to watch for Following the recent pink moon event, there are eight more full moons to look out for this year, with supermoons occurring in October, November and December. Here’s the list of full moons remaining in 2025, according to the Farmers’ Almanac: ●       May 12: Flower moon ●       June 11: Strawberry moon ●       July 10: Buck moon ●       August 9: Sturgeon moon ●       September 7: Corn moon ●       October 6: Harvest moon ●       November 5: Beaver moon ●       December 4: Cold moon Lunar and solar eclipses in 2025 In the lead-up to the fall season, two eclipse events will grace the sky. A total lunar eclipse will be most visible from Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, parts of eastern South America, Alaska and Antarctica on September 7 and 8. A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when Earth is between the sun and moon and the three celestial objects line up in a row so that the moon passes into our planet’s shadow.

      The best astronomy binoculars and stargazing accessories, according to real stargazers (Courtesy CNN Underscored) When the moon is within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, it takes on a reddish hue, which has led to the nickname “blood moon” for a lunar eclipse, according to NASA. That shadow isn’t perfect, so sunbeams sneak around the shadow’s edges, bathing the moon in warm hues. A partial solar eclipse will occur on September 21 as the moon moves between the sun and Earth but the celestial bodies aren’t perfectly aligned, according to NASA. In this type of event, the moon only blocks part of the sun’s face, creating a crescent shape in which it appears the moon is taking a “bite” out of the sun. This event will be visible to parts of Australia, Antarctica and the Pacific Ocean.",,0.3554808497428894
"Editor’s note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. When astronomers search for evidence of life beyond Earth, what signs are they seeking? Would clues be traced to microfossils trapped within ancient Martian rocks, swim in waters of an ocean world, or lead to an Earth-like twin thought of as Planet B? Or perhaps a technosignature, a signal that could be created by intelligent life, might point scientists in the right direction. The scientific community has debated the question — as well as where the evidence of life may be found — for years. This week, researchers shared a finding from an intriguing exoplanet that might represent the next step toward discovering whether life is possible on another world. Other worlds Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have found chemical fingerprints in the atmosphere of the distant planet K2-18b that could belong to molecules only created by life on Earth. The molecules, dimethyl sulfide and potentially dimethyl disulfide, are typically made by marine phytoplankton on Earth. Nikku Madhusudhan, professor of astrophysics and exoplanetary science at the University of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, and his colleagues believe K2-18b, located 124 light-years from Earth, is a Hycean world, or a potentially habitable planet entirely covered in liquid water with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. “Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have,” he said. However, the study authors have not declared a definitive discovery of life beyond our planet — and experts remain skeptical about the idea of the molecules representing signs of biological activity. Ocean secrets An expedition seeking previously unknown marine life has revealed the first footage of a colossal squid, which resembles a “glass sculpture,” in its native deep-sea environment. Defying gravity This week, six female passengers, including singer Katy Perry and journalist Gayle King, went on a roughly 10-minute journey to space and back again aboard a Blue Origin New Shepard flight. But how exactly do experts define where Earth ends and space begins during such a brief jaunt? The capsule reached 346,802 feet (106 kilometers) above ground level and 350,449 feet above mean sea level (107 kilometers). New Shepard traveled well above the Kármán line, a point at 62 miles (100 kilometers) that’s often used to define the altitude at which airspace ends and outer space begins. But throughout the history of its usage, the Kármán line has often been controversial. Once upon a planet Seismologist Deborah Kilb was the first to notice unusual tremors beneath the Sierra Nevada. They were occurring at a depth where Earth’s crust is typically too hot for quake activity, said Kilb of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Now, Kilb and other researchers studying deep rock deformations beneath the Sierra Nevada have used an imaging technique to map Earth’s internal structure — and they detected the planet’s crust peeling away. The phenomenon could shed light on how the continents formed and determine whether there are other parts of the planet where the crust is peeling. Separately, the contents of a 4.6 billion-year-old rare type of meteorite could change how scientists understand Earth’s origin story and just how long water has been present on the planet. Look up Amateur astronomers discovered a new comet, known as C/2025 F2 (SWAN), at the end of March, but in recent days, the celestial object’s story has gained a new twist. The latest observations of the comet suggest the object, made of ancient rock, frozen gases and dust, has disintegrated on its way to a close approach of the sun, which was anticipated to occur on May 1. However, the comet’s remnant is still visible and will be for a few weeks, according to experts. Here’s everything you need to know about how and when to see it.

"Five years after COVID-19 triggered national lockdowns, economic uncertainty and killed millions, the World Health Organization’s member countries agreed on a draft “pandemic treaty” that sets guidelines for how the international community might confront the next global health crisis. Related article
      CDC considers narrowing its Covid-19 vaccine recommendations After the world’s largely disastrous response to the coronavirus, countries tasked the WHO with overseeing a pandemic treaty in 2021. Negotiations concluded early Wednesday on an agreement expected to be adopted next month at the U.N. health agency’s annual meeting in Geneva. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus heralded it as a historic moment, saying countries have proven that “in our divided world, nations can still work together to find common ground and a shared response.” Following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the country from the WHO in January, American officials were barred from participating in the talks by the Trump administration and are not expected to sign the treaty. During COVID-19, it was largely American research and development that produced the most effective vaccines and medicines. Weeks after Trump’s decision, Argentina’s President Javier Milei also exited the WHO, citing “profound differences” with the U.N. agency. Rachael Crockett, of the advocacy group Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, described the draft pandemic treaty as “a product of compromise.” She said it contained strong provisions, but only if countries chose to implement them: “This could change what we saw in COVID, when some populations didn’t get access to what they needed.” Related article
      FDA delays full approval of Novavax Covid-19 vaccine even though it was on track for clearance The draft treaty notably includes a provision to guarantee that countries that share critical virus samples receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines, with the WHO to hold up to 20% of such products to ensure poorer countries get supplies. Negotiations on this provision are expected to continue after the treaty is likely accepted by member countries in May. Crockett acknowledged that, as is often the case with international law, there are few consequences for countries that don’t comply: “There’s not much that can be done if countries choose not to ratify or abide by it.” Yuanqiong Hu, of aid organization Doctors Without Borders, said that if disputes arise between countries, the treaty includes a mechanism for them to use diplomatic channels, followed by arbitration. Countries are already legally bound by the International Health Regulations to do things like quickly report dangerous new outbreaks. But those have been flouted repeatedly, including by African countries during Ebola and other outbreaks, China in the early stages of COVID-19 and arguably the U.S. amid its ongoing bird flu epidemic.",,0.27230992913246155
"Drugmaker Eli Lilly said Thursday that an experimental pill form of popular GLP-1 medications helped people with type 2 diabetes lose an average of nearly 8% of their body weight after 40 weeks and lowered their A1C levels. Lilly, which makes the injectable drugs Zepbound to treat obesity and Mounjaro and Trulicity to treat diabetes, is among several companies chasing an effective pill form of GLP-1s. The only such pill available so far comes with strict diet restrictions. Lilly’s announcement comes on the heels of an announcement from Pfizer, which said Monday that it was ending development of its daily pill treatment for obesity. A patient in the clinical trial had a possible liver injury that was no longer a problem once they stopped taking that drug, Pfizer said. In 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk’s Rybelsus for treatment of type 2 diabetes, but it has to be taken on an empty stomach. Some doctors also report that Rybelsus may not be as effective as injections yet still comes with side effects. Related article
      Pfizer ends development of potential pill obesity treatment Lilly says that no such diet restrictions are needed with its experimental oral medication, orforglipron, and that it’s the first drug of its kind to complete a Phase 3 trial. the Indianapolis company said that in a study of more than 550 people, orforglipron reduced weight by an average of 16 pounds (7.9%) among people who had type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise alone, and who were using the highest dose of the medication. The participants were still losing weight by the end of the 40-week trial. The trial also achieved its primary goal of lowering participants’ A1C level – a measurement of the average amount of glucose in blood over the previous three months – more than a placebo. Participants saw an average reduction of 1.3% to 1.6% from a baseline of 8%. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the body’s main source of energy. People who have diabetes can’t make enough insulin, a hormone the pancreas makes to help the body keep blood sugar levels in a certain range. People with type 2 diabetes may also have cells that are resistant to the effects of insulin. GLP-1 drugs help control blood sugar by stimulating the pancreas to release insulin and suppressing the release of another hormone. GLP-1s also help reduce the feeling of hunger and can make people feel full for longer. Orforglipron helped more than 65% of trial participants get to or maintain their A1C at or under 6.5%, the level at which people are considered to have diabetes, Lilly said. Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific officer, said Wednesday that even before the trial results were released within the company, he knew they would be good. “When I walked into the room to see the results, I saw everybody smiling, so I knew they were about to share good news with me,” he said. Related article
      More people with type 1 diabetes are using GLP-1 drugs, study finds, despite limited evidence on safety or effectiveness Liver injury like what was seen in the trial of the Pfizer drug is always possible with small-molecule drugs like this one, Skovronsky said, and it is difficult to detect whether it will cause a problem until the drug is tested in enough people. “We did not see a liver safety signal with ours, which was a relief,” Skovronsky said. Side effects with the pill were similar to those reported with injectable forms of GLP-1 drugs. The adverse events were considered generally mild to moderate, according to the company, with upset stomach the most commonly reported. Many people who use injectable GLP-1s eventually quit because of side effects. But by the end of this trial, Skovronsky said, more than 90% of the participants had stuck with the medication. GLP-1 injections are highly effective, but for many people, they are cost-prohibitive. The injections are also complicated and costly to make. A daily pill would be easier to use and, because it would be cheaper to manufacture, could possibly lower patient costs, expert say. It’s too early to know how much orforglipron might cost if it’s approved. Injection drugs have other downsides, as well. They need to be refrigerated and require plastic applications, whereas pills have less packaging. “Drugs in tablet form are valuable for a lot of patients for a lot of reasons, particularly those who are needle-phobic,” said Dr. Amy Rothberg, a clinical professor of medicine in the Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes in the Department of Internal Medicine and a research professor of nutritional sciences in the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan. “And it probably just simplifies things to just add on another pill, as opposed to taking a shot, which is a little more complex.” Related article
      Ozempic shown to reduce drinking in first trial in alcohol-use disorder Accessibility to drugs that need to be taken over a long period of time is key, said Dr. Priya Jaisinghani, an endocrinologist who works in obesity medicine at NYU Langone Health. “As clinicians, our priority is to align treatment with our patients’ preferences to support long-term adherence,” said Jalisinghani, who is also a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and who was not involved with the new research. “For patients who may find injectable therapies challenging or undesirable, an oral alternative may improve both initiation and continuation of therapy.” Rothberg, who was likewise not involved with the new trial, hopes Lilly will pass on cost savings to patients if the drug is approved. “We could reach many more people then,” she said. A growing number of people do need treatment for diabetes or obesity. More than 40% of US adults live with obesity, and about 11.6% of the population – an estimated 38.4 million Americans – had been diagnosed with diabetes as of 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most have type 2 diabetes. Skovronsky said that Lilly has already been producing orforglipron pills after getting earlier promising results assuming that the rest of the trials will go well. “That way, we’ll have adequate supply to meet demand,” he said. Lilly plans to publish the results of its late-stage trial in a peer-reviewed journal and expects to share more results later this year, along with findings from another clinical trial program that it created to evaluate the drug for its weight management qualities. It’s also testing to see if a pill might improve people’s high blood pressure and sleep apnea, two conditions that have been helped with certain injectable GLP-1s. Lilly said it expects to apply for approval of orforglipron for weight management by the end of the year and submit results concerning its treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2026.",,0.17754177749156952
"Two long-planned vaccine meetings — one at the US Centers for Disease Control and another at the US Food and Drug Administration — have now been disrupted under the watch of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stirring questions about whether seasonal flu shots or other lifesaving vaccines will be delayed or harder to access. The February meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was postponed “to accommodate public comment,” according to a note online. The three-day meeting, which had been scheduled for this week, was to review the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for meningococcal disease, which is seeing a resurgence, as well as RSV, flu, chikungunya and mpox. It also included two votes related to Vaccines for Children, the government program that buys and distributes vaccines to state and local health departments for children whose families wouldn’t otherwise be able to pay for them. Related article
      FDA meeting to choose flu vaccine composition canceled without explanation ACIP typically meets three times a year, in February, June and October. There’s no word on whether or when the February meeting will be rescheduled and it’s unclear whether the delay will hinder access to shots. On Wednesday, the FDA canceled a March 13 meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was to discuss the recipe manufacturers must follow to make this fall’s flu shots. No explanation was given for the cancellation. In a statement to CNN on Thursday, the FDA said it would still weigh in on the makeup of flu shots but didn’t indicate whether it would seek its advisers’ guidance or allow for the public discussion and debate that usually occurs. “The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,” the statement said. The uncertainty around the government’s process for regulating and recommending vaccines comes as the US is in the grips of a brutal flu season and experiencing a resurgence of measles, a vaccine preventable disease. Experts say these infections are increasing because of growing hesitancy to use vaccines, something they fear the new HHS director will only encourage. Kennedy casts doubt on vaccine advisers Kennedy maintains that he is not anti-vaccine, but he has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of immunizations and questioned the research and regulations that allow them to be used. Related article
      RFK Jr. said measles outbreaks are ‘not unusual’ in the US. Doctors say he’s wrong Kennedy, whose financial disclosures show he has made money from law firms that sue vaccine manufacturers, has also impugned some of the experts who advise federal agencies on vaccines. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy incorrectly stated that 97% of the members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee had conflicts of interest. In fact, the panel has strict policies to guard against conflicts, and a screening process for members to ensure they are impartial when they vote. Members of FDA’s vaccine committee are also subject to strict conflict of interest rules and are required to disclose potential conflicts during meetings. This week, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden wrote that false claims that ACIP members vote based on their financial ties is among the “most damaging” falsehoods about vaccines. Frieden said the 97% figure comes from a 2009 report, issued when he was CDC director. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives. It was an audit of lengthy and detailed conflict of interest forms submitted by all experts who served as CDC advisers in 2007. He said 97% had at least one missing response, which could have meant someone forgot to do something as simple as initial a page. He said it is not the same thing as a conflict of interest. “I really think that this is classic misinformation,” Frieden told CNN. Frieden also raised alarm about the postponed ACIP meeting, writing in a recent post on LinkedIn, “It’s certain there will be misleading, inaccurate information claiming ACIP members have conflicts of interest. Here’s the plain truth: ACIP, made up of pediatricians, public health specialists, and parents, is the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness.” Related article
      ‘Deadly consequences’: Health agencies reel from thousands of job cuts while critical research grants remain on hold Without either vaccine committee weighing in on vaccine regulation or recommendations, health-care providers worry there will be delays on vaccines or limits on people’s ability to access them. “Cancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season,” Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said after the cancellation of the FDA flu shot meeting. “If the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.” In a February 20 open letter to Kennedy, Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a coalition of groups called the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease pushed for the “prompt rescheduling” of the ACIP meeting. “Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance. Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats,” the letter said. “Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.” Flu shot decision in limbo There are several different ways to make flu vaccines, but the most common is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs — a painstaking operation that takes months to finish. For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure that manufacturers can deliver their shots to doctor’s offices and pharmacies in time. In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA. That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, a network of seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and FDA are members, and representatives from both agencies participated in the deliberations which got underway this week, WHO said. “The US did participate in this meeting,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for Covid-19, said at a news briefing on Friday. “I want to be very clear that the US is still contributing. I know that there’s a lot of attention on the US right now, but we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of this global system that’s in place.” These experts meet twice a year — in the fall and spring — to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. On Friday, WHO announced the strains that it thinks will most closely match the viruses that will be making people sick next fall. Those picks would swap out the H3N2 component of this years vaccine, which was only a partial match to the circulating viruses, for a new one. “I think the match is not perfect, but it is a reasonable match, and is still the best preventative we have against infection with influenza,” said Prof. Ian Barr, deputy director at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and a member of GISRS, in a new briefing after the strain selection What typically happens next is that the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet and publicly discuss the recommendation, and then make its own endorsement. The agency ultimately makes the final decision, which can differ from its advisers’, although they generally align. This year, there won’t be an advisory meeting. The FDA said it would still make recommendations to manufacturers but didn’t specify how it would come to a decision or when. “If there’s no FDA recommended strains, the US manufacturers are kind of stuck,” said Dr. LJ Tan who is chief policy and partnerships officer for nonprofit vaccine advocacy group Immunize.org. Flu vaccine manufacturers contacted by CNN on Thursday said the missed VRBPAC meeting wouldn’t break their stride. “Just as every year, we have already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season,” wrote Sanofi in a statement to CNN. GSK also said it will continue to work with FDA on its flu strain recommendation in the US. But canceling the VRBPAC meeting will deprive Americans of public discussion and debate that happens when these experts meet. It makes the process less transparent, Immunize.org’s Tan said. “It’s very dangerous to bypass your expert advisory committee,” Tan said. When experts are out of the conversation In his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised “radical transparency” at HHS. “Public health agencies should be transparent and if we want Americans to restore trust in the public health agencies, we need transparency,” Kennedy said. Related article
      An intense flu season is filling hospitals with severely ill patients Vaccine advocates say canceling advisory committee meetings undermines that goal. “You heard what we thought. We disagreed on some things, and for people who are interested, you can see how we arrived at the conclusion that we did,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a member of FDA’s VRBPAC who is also a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Iowa. Perlman said he was also worried that skipping committee meetings would deprive the public of a window into the government’s vaccine decisions. “The country is in so much flux right now about what it thinks about vaccines, what it thinks about medical devices, what it thinks about drugs. The more transparency there is, hopefully, the more people who are undecided about things will see where the committee is coming from,” Perlman told CNN’s Meg Tirrell. Other experts agreed the committees are an important layer of independent review. “It’s kind of taking experts out of the conversation,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Many of these decisions are tricky and nuanced, and having the opportunity for a group of experts who are familiar with these vaccines and familiar with these diseases. You know, have an open discussion is critically important.” The FDA has not said how it will choose vaccine strains for the fall, but if it follows WHO’s recommendation, it will mean that the US will be relying on data from the organization despite President Donald Trump’s order that the US withdraw its support from WHO and stop sharing information. “It’s part of the chaos, whether it’s planned or not, or just incompetence,” Moss said.

"Longtime NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who has ventured to space four times, returned to Earth on Saturday night from the International Space Station. Pettit, who turned 70 on Sunday, landed at 9:20 p.m. ET in a Soyuz spacecraft with Roscosmos cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner near Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, after a seven-month stay aboard the orbiting laboratory. The scientist invented the first object patented in space — called the Capillary Beverage, Space Cup or Zero-G cup, which makes it easier to drink beverages in the absence of gravity, and he is also a celebrated astrophotographer known for capturing unique views of the cosmos. “One of the things I like to do with my astrophotography is to have a composition and a perspective that’s different than an Earth-centric one, typically showing an Earth horizon with the atmosphere on edge, the limb, and then some kind of astronomy, astrophotography, in relationship to that,” Pettit said from the space station during an April 3 interview with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. Pettit said his photography is about the perspective of being in orbit. “Earth is amazingly beautiful when your feet are firmly planted on the ground, and it’s beautiful from space,” Pettit said. “And it’s hard to say what is more beautiful. I think it’s because space is a unique opportunity we seek to focus on the beauty of being in orbit. If we had people living their whole life in orbit, when they come down to Earth, they would probably think that was the most beautiful perspective they’d ever seen.” Pettit takes his photos from the cupola on the space station, a favorite of crew members due to its seven windows that overlook Earth.

"Recent outbreaks of measles in the United States are driving up case counts and raising alarm among public health experts, especially as vaccination rates among children lag. The concern this year comes after the first reported death in the US since 2015 and following a significant increase in the number of cases in 2024. CNN is monitoring these cases and updating this page each week as new national data is collected and released from state health departments by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A large outbreak in West Texas is largely responsible for the spike in the national cases so far in 2025. Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease. It can cause serious health consequences or death, especially for young and unvaccinated children. Most of the cases involve people younger than age 20. General symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the US who get measles will be hospitalized, according to the CDC. About 1 in every 20 children will develop pneumonia, and others may develop a dangerous swelling in the brain called encephalitis. Up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles may die from respiratory and neurologic complications. National data compiled by the CDC lags behind reports collected by state health agencies. Here’s the latest national snapshot of which states have reported cases so far. Measles is preventable, thanks to a highly effective vaccine. Experts recommend that children get the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine in two doses: the first between 12 months and 15 months of age, and a second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles infection; two doses are about 97% effective. The current outbreak “is absolutely being driven and started by unvaccinated individuals,” said Dr. Michael Mina, chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease. The increased concern about measles cases can be attributed to falling vaccination rates and to increased travel, which can result in unvaccinated people acquiring measles abroad and bringing it back to the US, according to the CDC, which occurred in 2019. Here’s how the cases this year compare to the past. Measles was eliminated in the US in 2000. Imported cases are expected, but when vaccination rates are high, the risk remains low and outbreaks are rare. Outbreaks in 2019, particularly two in underimmunized Orthodox Jewish communities in New York, threatened measles elimination status in the US. “If a measles outbreak continues for a year or more, the United States could lose its measles elimination status,” according to the CDC. Because measles is so contagious, a high level of vaccination coverage is key to minimizing spread. The US has set a target vaccination rate of 95%, but coverage among kindergarteners has dipped below that in recent years. MMR vaccine series completion among kindergarteners decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving about 280,000 at risk, according to the CDC. Coverage varies widely by state.",,0.2636943459510803
"A new report on cancer in the US shows a steady decline in overall deaths from 2001 through 2022. The rate of diagnoses among men fell from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021 but these incidence rates among women increased slightly every year between 2003 and 2021. Those trends were interrupted in 2020, when cancer incidence rates fell significantly, the report shows, possibly because of disruptions in medical care related to the Covid-19 pandemic. After 2020, they returned to expected levels. “Because fewer cancers were diagnosed in 2020, especially through screening, we may see a larger percentage of cancers diagnosed at a late stage in future years,” the report says.

      After her breast cancer diagnosis, Gaby Dabrowski found unexpected ‘joy’ – and success – on the tennis court The 2024 Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer was published Monday in the journal Cancer. It’s based on data from cancer registries funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health’s National Cancer Institute, and it’s released by those institutions, the American Cancer Society and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. “Overall, cancer incidence and death rates continue to decline, representing changes in risk factors, increases in screening utilization, and advances in treatment,” the researchers write. “However, sustained disparities by race and ethnicity emphasize the need to fully understand the factors that create these differences so that they can be mitigated.” Fewer people in the US are using tobacco, helping lower incidence and death rates for smoking-related cancers like lung, bladder and larynx, the report says. And these sustained declines in lung cancer have been a major contributor to the overall improvements in cancer death. However, incidence rates are on the rise for several other cancers, including those linked with excess weight, such as pancreas and kidney cancers; uterine, breast and liver cancers among women; and colon and rectal cancers among adolescents and young adults.

      Young women are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with cancer as young men: ‘We’re seeing a change’ Previously published research has shown that cancer diagnoses are shifting from older to younger adults and from men to women. Middle‐age women now have a slightly higher cancer risk than their male counterparts, and young women are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as young men, according to an American Cancer Society report published earlier this year. The new report shows that incidence rates among women have risen 0.3% each year. The largest observed increase among women was for stomach cancer, which the researchers say may be largely due to a change in the classification of tumors by the World Health Organization. Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are also gradually increasing, driven mostly by types of cancer that have been associated with factors like obesity, alcohol use and age when someone gives birth for the first time. The data continues to show large racial disparities. For example, Black women have a 40% higher rate of death from breast cancer than White women, and their rate of death from uterine cancer is double that of White women. Differences in access to care and less use of diagnostic procedures and treatment may account for some of the difference, the researchers say. “One additional potential risk factor disproportionately affecting Black women is the use of chemical hair relaxers, which may be associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer among postmenopausal women.” Changing habits such as stopping tobacco use, staying at a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet with fruits and vegetables, avoiding alcohol and protecting skin can all reduce risk of cancer. Screening can help find and treat cancers early, before they spread. Screenings are available and recommended for certain people for breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer.",,0.27995404601097107
"US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary suggested in a new interview that autism is caused by a range of environmental and dietary exposures, echoing some comments made by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. but stopping short of referencing vaccines. “I think it is the cumulative burden of all of these exposures, environmental and dietary, that alter the microbiome,” he told Megyn Kelly in an hourlong interview that spanned issues such as societal distrust of federal health agencies, industry influence and food policy. Related article
      Anti-vaccine sentiment may derail vaccines already awaiting FDA approval, experts fear He also insisted that Kennedy’s criticism of vaccines — and push to study links between immunizations and autism, although research has found no proof of any ties — has been misconstrued. “That’s not what he’s saying at all,” Makary said before referencing a study at the US National Institutes of Health using electronic health records to find potential autism drivers. Kennedy has said the agency is involved in a “massive” testing and research effort that will find some of the causes of autism by September. Makary’s interview on “The Megyn Kelly Show,” published Thursday, marks his first sit-down discussion since starting in the commissioner role 17 days earlier. It came nearly a week after a visit from the HHS secretary to the FDA campus that unleashed controversy over Kennedy’s allegations of “deep state” corruption within the agency. Makary appeared to defend Kennedy’s remarks, citing the opioid crisis as “the quintessential example of what’s wrong with a cozy relationship, when the regulator agency is captured by the industry.” But he also told Kelly that “there are no plans for any mass cuts” at the FDA after roughly 3,500 employees were laid off this month in restructuring led by the Department of Government Efficiency. “If somebody is doing a good job doing [a drug or device] review, we want to encourage them and support it. It’s hard work,” Makary said. “We want to do other things here at the FDA to support a great culture.” Makary said the FDA would remove industry representatives from advisory committees that discuss reviews of drugs, vaccines and medical devices.

      In first news conference as HHS secretary, Kennedy says autism is an epidemic in the US “We’re going to be replacing them, whenever statutorily possible, with patients and … family caregivers,” he said. “We are going to be inviting pharma companies to send representatives to the advisory committees, but they can sit with the rest of the public and watch and pose questions as the rest of the American public can.” Although these advisory committees typically include an industry representative, they do not have voting power on the committees’ questions. Kelly asked Makary about Dr. Peter Marks, the former director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, who was forced out last month. Marks, who had been instrumental in shaping the first Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed effort to rapidly develop Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, wrote in his resignation letter that Kennedy is undermining vaccine confidence. Makary distanced himself from Marks and his comments. “I never knew the guy. I never met him. He resigned before I came to office,” he said. “There’s a lot of talented people who can do that job well, a lot of very smart people who are right now … applying for that job.”",,0.2500317692756653

      Over half of US states are trying to eliminate food dyes. Here’s what you can do now In January, when former President Joe Biden was still in office, the FDA announced that it had banned the use of red dye No. 3 in food, beverages and ingested drugs. The move came more than 30 years after scientists discovered links to cancer in animals. The Trump administration appears poised to take action on a broader set of petroleum-based synthetic dyes that are used to make food and beverages brightly colored and more appealing to consumers. In March, Kennedy joined West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey to support newly signed legislation to ban certain synthetic dyes in food. The state was the first to institute a sweeping ban on synthetic food dyes, which have been tied to issues with learning and behavior in some children and of which Kennedy has been an outspoken critic. Lawmakers in more than half of states – both Republican- and Democrat-led – are pushing to restrict access, according to a tracker by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization, reflecting a bipartisan push toward a safer food system. Artificial food dyes are not explicitly mentioned in president’s order forming the commission to “Make America Healthy Again,” but some Republican legislators have invoked Kennedy’s “MAHA” motto in their proposals. With a patchwork of state-led regulations bubbling, industry associations have pushed for a more consistent federal standard. The National Confectioners Association said in March that there is a role for state legislators to play in the US food system, but that the FDA is the “rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety.” Some of the association’s member companies sell products containing artificial dyes.

      Red dye No. 3 is now banned in the US. Here’s what studies show about more common dyes “Food safety is the number one priority for U.S. confectionery companies, and we will continue to follow and comply with FDA’s guidance and safety standards,” the association added via email. John Hewitt, senior vice president of state affairs at the Consumer Brands Association, echoed this sentiment earlier this year, saying it’s why the trade association has urged the FDA to “aggressively acknowledge its responsibility as the nation’s food safety regulator.” Governments, researchers and nonprofit organizations have long raised concerns about artificial dyes. Red No. 3, red No. 40, blue No. 2 and green No. 3 all have been linked with cancer or tumors in animals. Other sources say red No. 40 and yellow No. 5 and No. 6 contain or may be contaminated with known carcinogens. Blue No. 1 and yellow No. 6 may also be toxic to some human cells. And as little as 1 milligram of yellow dye No. 5 may cause irritability, restlessness and sleep disturbances for sensitive children. But experts have criticized the lack of funding for more research, and minimal action taken by the federal government to regulate the dyes. Related article
      Top NIH nutrition researcher studying ultraprocessed foods departs, citing censorship under Kennedy “It’s been obvious from RFK Jr’s statements that this was going to happen. This is an easy one. Non-petroleum substitute dyes are available and used widely in other countries by the same companies that sell products here. Companies have been promising to get rid of the petroleum dyes for years. The time has come,” said Marion Nestle, a prominent food policy researcher. “In public health terms, this is low-hanging fruit. I want to see RFK Jr. take on ultra-processed foods, a much tougher problem and a far more important one.” Food dyes are most commonly used in foods of low nutritional value such as candy and soft drinks, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. But experts say that they may also be found in products that aren’t conspicuously colorful. Consumers who want to avoid artificial dyes can check ingredient lists on food and beverage products.

"Half of states in the US are now reporting measles cases, with the national total surpassing 800 cases so far this year, according to a CNN tally. Most of the cases are concentrated in a multistate outbreak involving Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas that reached 709 cases Friday, according to state health department updates. Texas has reported 597 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico reported 63 cases, and Oklahoma reported 12 cases – nine confirmed and three probable – as of Friday. New Mexico and Oklahoma’s numbers have stayed the same since Tuesday. Related article
      Tracking measles cases in the United States Cases in Kansas, which the state health department says may be linked to the larger outbreak, have reached 37 as of Wednesday. Experts say these numbers are all a severe undercount because many cases are going unreported. The multistate outbreak has put 69 people in the hospital across Texas, New Mexico and Kansas, five more since Tuesday’s update. Nationally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that at least 85 people have been hospitalized, accounting for 11% of confirmed cases. CDC data shows that only 3% of cases this year have been reported in people who have gotten one or two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Local health officials are scrambling to increase vaccinations, especially in heavily undervaccinated communities. Clinics in Lubbock, Texas, near the epicenter of the outbreak, just expanded their hours. These Lubbock clinics have administered 450 more doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine than typically would have been given by this time of year, Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health said this week. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against the measles virus. Related article
      Measles costs are accumulating as funding cuts threaten the outbreak response Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. Experts warn that growing case numbers could threaten the country’s elimination status if spread of the outbreak continues. “That … would happen after 12 months of ongoing circulation of the same sequence,” Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at the CDC, said Tuesday at a meeting of the agency’s vaccine advisers. That date would be around January 20, 2026, he said. Two children in Texas have died in the current multistate outbreak, and a third death in New Mexico is under investigation. They were all unvaccinated. The World Health Organization said that cases in Mexico have also been linked to cases in Texas. Three cases in Colorado are being investigated for connection to the outbreak after two of the people traveled to Mexico. Another case was identified after a Pennsylvania resident traveled to Texas, though it is unclear what part of the state the person visited. In a news release last week, the Arkansas health department said that the second case of measles identified in the state this year was “exposed during out of state travel,” but no further details were provided. Many cases in other states have been linked to international travel.",,0.22531038522720337
"A Texas doctor who has been treating children in a measles outbreak was shown on video with a measles rash on his face in a clinic a week before Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met him and praised him as an “extraordinary” healer. Dr. Ben Edwards appeared in the video posted March 31 by the anti-vaccine group Kennedy once led, Children’s Health Defense. In it, Edwards appears wearing scrubs and talking with parents and children in a makeshift clinic he set up in Seminole, Texas, ground zero of the outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people and killed three, including two children. Edwards is asked whether he had measles, and he responded, “Yes,” then said his infection started the day before the video was recorded. “Yesterday was pretty achy. Little mild fever. Spots came in the afternoon. Today, I woke up feeling good,” Edwards said in the video. Related article
      Kennedy touts unconventional therapies for measles linked to disciplined Texas doctor Measles is most contagious for about four days before and four days after the rash appears and is one of the world’s most contagious diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors and public health experts said Edwards’ decision to go into the clinic put children, their parents and their community at risk because he could have spread it to others. They said there was no scenario in which Edwards’ conduct would be reasonable. Kennedy met with Edwards about a week after the video was posted by Children’s Health Defense, the group Kennedy led for years until December. In an April 6 post on X, Kennedy said he “visited with these two extraordinary healers,” including Edwards and another doctor, and praised their use of two unproven treatments for measles. Even as measles has exploded in Texas and spread across the country, Kennedy, the nation’s top health official, has declined to consistently and forcefully encourage people to vaccinate their children and remind them that the vaccine is safe. Kennedy’s post drawing attention to Edwards is inappropriate but unsurprising given Kennedy’s record, said Dr. Craig Spencer, a medical doctor who is also a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health. “I think is unfortunately perfectly on-brand for how he thinks that medicine should be practiced,” Spencer said. “And that is what makes me remarkably uncomfortable and extremely concerned and scared for the next three-and-a-half years.” Related article
      Half of US states have reported measles cases this year It was unclear whether Kennedy knew that Edwards had gone into his clinic while infected with measles before meeting him. A spokesperson for Kennedy said he is not anti-vaccine and that he is “committed to improving children’s health in America and has re-deployed resources to Texas to help with the current outbreak.” He did not answer why the health secretary chose to meet with and praise Edwards rather than any of the other doctors in West Texas who have been treating children in the outbreak. Edwards told The Associated Press in an email that he “interacted with zero patients that were not already infected with measles” during the time he was infectious. “Therefore, obviously, there were no patients that were put in danger of acquiring measles since they already had measles.” But Jessica Steier, a public health scientist, said the video shows Edwards in the room with people who do not appear sick, including parents of sick children and the people who visited the clinic from Children’s Health Defense. She also questioned what steps Edwards was taking to confirm people were sick with measles, rather than relying on guesswork. Steier, who runs the Science Literacy Lab and co-wrote an article about Edwards’ conduct, said while there may be some extraordinary emergencies where it would be appropriate for a sick doctor to work, this is not one of those situations because there is no shortage of providers who are not infected. She also pointed out that the video shows Edwards was not wearing a mask. Related article
      Measles costs are accumulating as funding cuts threaten the outbreak response “You have the HHS secretary lifting him up,” she said. “You know, it’s so, so dangerous. I really feel for the people who are on the ground.” Children’s Health Defense has sued a number of news organizations, among them the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines. Kennedy’s promotion of a doctor who has touted unproven measles treatments is “wholly irresponsible” but is in line with Kennedy’s long public record of anti-vaccine views, said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He said Kennedy has carried those views to his new job as the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “He’s not the director of Children’s Health Defense anymore. He’s responsible for the health and well-being of children in this country,” Offit said. “It’s an emergency, but Kennedy is not treating it that way.”",,0.31531229615211487
"Alison Singer has a few people she’d like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to meet. Singer’s brother and daughter are two of the millions living with autism in the United States, and part of a much larger community that has very publicly expressed feeling hurt and disrespected by the US Health and Human Services secretary’s description of who they are and how they live. “He clearly doesn’t understand either one of them,” said Singer, the president of the Autism Science Foundation. Related article
      In first news conference as HHS secretary, Kennedy says autism is an epidemic in the US Singer’s daughter lives and works on a farm where she takes care of animals and grows and sells crops, and her brother lives in group home where he delivers meals on wheels to homebound senior citizens, she said. They’re both loving individuals who are active members of the community and family, she said. But Kennedy “made it sound like these were people whose lives were worthless, when that couldn’t be further from the case,” Singer said. At his first news conference as head of HHS, Kennedy said this week that the rising rate of autism in the country is an “individual tragedy” and “catastrophic for our country.” A new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that autism rates in 8-year-olds in the US rose from 1 in 36 in 2020 to 1 in 31 in 2022. The increase continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition. But Kennedy has rejected that concept, instead pushing the idea that autism is “preventable” and part of a “chronic disease epidemic” that “destroys” children and families. “These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted,” Kennedy said Wednesday. People with autism, their families and advocates were quick to refute Kennedy’s comments. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, is a vaccine researcher who has an adult daughter with autism whom he wrote a book about. Related article
      US autism rate continues to rise, CDC says, pointing to greater awareness and better screening “My adult daughter Rachel, works everyday, pays taxes, has friends, loves going to the movies, and listens to lousy (IMO) music. She has a meaningful and thoughtful life,” he wrote in a social media post on Thursday. “Our U.S. Dept of HHS has lost all of its humanity, compassion, and intellectual curiosity.” Many advocates and researchers alike say that Kennedy’s narrow description of autism – his characterization of both the science and the experience of what living with it can be like – is reductive and harmful. Kennedy’s rhetoric sets the US back at least a decade to a time rife with damaging stigma around autism that the community has fought hard to change, said Zoe Gross, director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network – one of a group of leading autism advocacy organizations that released a joint statement on Thursday about these concerns. “He set up this litmus test of what it is to be a person and have a valuable life,” said Gross, who is autistic. “It’s not acceptable to talk that way anymore because of the work that we’ve done.” In a social media post on Friday, leadership from technology company Aspiritech championed dozens of people on the team – more than 90% of whom have autism, they say – and highlighted ways that their tax-paying employees directly contradict the picture Kennedy painted of autism. “We’d like you to meet 100 people who will help dispel the many misconceptions about autistic people that seem to be driving a false narrative,” the company wrote, inviting Kennedy to visit its offices in Chicago. “We’d like to talk to you about how the idea of a cure feels like you don’t want autistic people to exist. Autism is a birth-to-death condition, and many diagnosed autistic people view it as a critical piece of their identity.” Autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, refers to a broad range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by challenges with communication skills and social skills. People with autism “may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other people,” according to the CDC, and “the abilities of people with ASD can vary significantly.” Dr. Lisa Settles, director of Tulane University’s Center for Autism and Related Disorders, has spent more than 20 years in autism research and worked with thousands of patients. None of her patients have been exactly alike, but all of them have value, she said. Related article
      RFK Jr. claims new research effort will find cause of ‘autism epidemic’ by September “To me, it’s very obvious that [Kennedy] doesn’t know a lot about the diagnosis,” she said. “He’s pulling things together into a theory that isn’t based in any ounce of science, and it’s really frustrating to those of us who are professionals.” Kennedy later went on Fox News to “set the record straight.” He doubled down on the limitations that he says people with autism have, but clarified that he was specifically talking about the 1 in 4 people with autism who have “severe autism.” A CDC report from 2023 shows that about 27% of 8-year-olds with autism were considered to have “profound autism,” defined as children who were nonverbal, were minimally verbal or had an intelligence quotient (IQ) less than 50. That report analyzed data from 2000 to 2016. The latest CDC report did not include an analysis using this criteria. But other data on the cognitive level of children with autism contradicts Kennedy’s claim that “most cases now are severe,” or that these cases are driving the rise in prevalence. CDC data from 2022 shows that about 40% of 8-year-olds with autism had an IQ of 70 or less, up less than 2 percentage points from 2020 when about 38% did. Early diagnosis of autism is easiest in children who have greater support needs, experts say. “We see them because they’re not meeting their developmental milestones,” Settles said. “They have speech delay or total lack of speech, so those are going to be the kiddos that are picked up diagnostically first.” But some kids with autism who have lower support needs might continue to meet developmental milestones until age 8 or later, and those cases would be missed in the data that CDC is analyzing, she said. Advocacy groups over the years have worked to raise awareness to help parents and others understand what their child might be experiencing and seek out a diagnosis. “If the more severe cases are going to be the ones that are brought to your attention earlier, then it may look like the severe cases are increasing. But if you look overall, it’s really that we diagnose just as many kids with a level one as we do a level three,” Settles said. Related article
      New FDA chief offers support for Kennedy on autism claims, says no more ‘mass cuts’ planned And Kennedy’s use of outdated terminology like “severe” is also not in line with current science and can have damaging negative connotations, she said. “Clinically and professionally, we don’t use the word severe,” Settles said. “It’s really short-changing the individuals with autism, it’s short-changing the families, and it’s hurtful.” Kennedy has launched a “massive testing and research effort” at HHS to determine the cause of the “autism epidemic,” promising some answers as early as September. There are differing opinions in the autism community about the importance of searching for a cause when limited resources may be better spent understanding how to build support for people living with autism. But there’s broad agreement that Kennedy’s laser focus on environmental toxins is problematic, especially if he continues question science that has already proven that vaccines do not cause autism. “This was the most exciting time in research. Things that we thought five years ago sounded like science fiction were actually happening,” Singer said. “All that is now under threat to be derailed in favor of more research on vaccines.” And advocates emphasize that even if most people with autism can do the things that Kennedy said they can’t, those who may need more support deserve more respect. “If someone can’t do any of those things because of their disability, it doesn’t mean they can’t have a good life,” Gross said. “They deserve better than being a rhetorical prop.”",,0.2559136748313904
"When President Donald Trump named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his choice to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services, one group of health researchers was cautiously optimistic that their cause would finally have a champion at the highest levels of government: those focused on food and nutrition. “These are the kinds of things I’ve been saying and writing about for decades!” Marion Nestle, a prominent food policy researcher, wrote in November of some of Kennedy’s stated Make America Healthy Again goals: removing ultraprocessed foods from schools, restricting purchases of soda with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and ridding government agencies of conflicts of interest.

      Ultraprocessed foods make up to 70% of the US food supply. How to reduce your intake Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the US National Institutes of Health conducting some of the world’s only controlled trials on ultraprocessed foods, shared that optimism. “When I saw the MAHA movement gaining bipartisan support last year, it was music to my ears,” Hall wrote in a letter late last month to Kennedy and incoming NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. “I thought that after years of defunding human clinical research to understand metabolic disease perhaps NIH might finally prioritize the studies needed to uncover its root causes.” Instead, Hall announced his early retirement Wednesday, after 21 years at the NIH, in a post on social media, citing censorship of communication of his research findings. “Recent events have made me question whether NIH continues to be a place where I can freely conduct unbiased science,” Hall wrote, noting that it’s been his “life’s work” to “scientifically study how our food environment affects what we eat, and how what we eat affects our physiology” and that, given the new administration’s interest in those issues, he’d hoped to expand that research program. But instead, the post continued, “I experienced censorship in the reporting of our research because of agency concerns that it did not appear to fully support preconceived narratives of my agency’s leadership about ultra-processed food addiction.” Hall said he’d hoped that “was an aberration,” prompting him to write to his agency’s leadership asking to discuss those issues. He said he never received a response. “It’s disappointing that this individual is fabricating false claims,” an HHS spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday. “NIH scientists have, and will, continue to conduct interviews regarding their research through written responses or other means. We remain committed to promoting gold-standard research and advancing public health priorities. Any attempt to paint this as censorship is a deliberate distortion of the facts.” Hall’s letter to Kennedy and Bhattacharya, which circulated both within government and in external research circles and was obtained by CNN, sheds more light on what led to the departure of a key nutrition researcher from an administration that has said it’s dedicated to improving the nation’s nutrition. Related article
      Her research revealed a safety concern with a vaccine. Then the NIH pulled her funding Hall requested a discussion with the health leaders of ideas to advance studies into how the food supply contributes to rising chronic disease rates - a common focus of Kennedy and the MAHA movement - and serious concerns about significant disruptions to research and censorship of communications of his findings. “We have been hobbled on several occasions with intermittent inability to purchase food for our study participants or obtain research supplies,” he told Kennedy and Bhattacharya in the March 28 letter. “The future of our studies seems bleak given the inability to replace outgoing trainees who are the workhorses of our research.” Further, Hall wrote, “I’ve also experienced incidences of censorship in my ability to discuss our research.” He detailed what he called an intervention by HHS “regarding media coverage of our study on brain responses to ultra-processed foods.” The study, published March 4 in the journal Cell Metabolism, used brain imaging to see whether consuming ultraprocessed milkshakes high in fat and sugar caused reactions in dopamine similar to addictive drugs. “Surprisingly,” Hall and his team wrote in the paper, they didn’t, at least not large enough to be picked up on PET scans. “HHS denied an interview request from the New York Times and contacted the reporter directly to downplay our study results because our data might be viewed as failing to support preconceived HHS narratives about ultra-processed food addiction,” Hall said in the letter. “My written responses to the reporter’s questions were edited and submitted without my approval.” An HHS spokesperson denied that Hall’s responses were edited. CNN viewed copies of the written responses, which showed that an approved version sent to a reporter had added a line suggesting the study was small, with 50 participants. Hall noted Wednesday that, in fact, it was actually the largest of its kind. Hall added in an interview that he experienced censorship of his work in other instances as well. “For the first time in my 21-year career, I was told I wasn’t allowed to present data on the topic of ultraprocessed foods,” at a conference either in person or remotely, Hall said. “There was no reason given at that time.” “Then there was some interference in a paper where I was told we had to change the content of the paper or I would have to remove myself as being an author,” Hall continued, noting it was a section on health equity regarding ultraprocessed foods deemed to violate an executive order. “To avoid censoring a co-author who was not in the NIH who wrote that section of the paper, I withdrew myself as an author.” He said those experiences were “quite worrying to me,” and “made me think if I was to continue and experience this, I’m going to end up really hating my job.” CNN has reached out to HHS about Hall’s comments. It’s not the first time a Trump administration is said to have attempted to interfere with communication of health information from its agencies; in September 2020, a federal health official told CNN that Trump appointees had pushed to change language in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s weekly reports so they didn’t undermine the president’s political message during the Covid-19 pandemic. But Bhattacharya, who was sworn in as NIH director on April 1, has said it is a key priority to end what he sees as censorship at the federal research agency, claiming during his confirmation hearing that the Biden administration sought to censor him for divergent views on how to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We’ll never use this agency to censor scientists who disagree,” Bhattacharya said in an interview on Fox News. “If scientists are censored, we actually can’t have excellent science.” And food and nutrition researchers had high hopes for Kennedy, despite the broader public health world’s deep concerns about his history of spreading misinformation about vaccines - worries that have only increased as a deadly measles outbreak grows in Texas and surrounding states. On food, Kennedy’s priorities have appeared more aligned with most academic health researchers’. “I was hoping the administration would come in and say … ‘this is a big priority for us. We want to do this kind of study,’ ” said Jerold Mande, who served in food and nutrition policy roles in the administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and is now an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and CEO of the nonprofit Nourish Science. “They’ve said it’s a priority: In order to take steps to make a difference here, we need the science.” What sets Hall’s work apart, Mande said, is that he runs randomized, controlled clinical trials - considered the gold standard of research - to understand the effects of ultraprocessed foods on the body. Ultraprocessed foods are those that include industrially created ingredients that can’t be made in a regular home kitchen and are estimated to make up about 70% of the US food supply. Related video
      Americans love ultraprocessed foods. Science wants to know why These kinds of trials are especially difficult to do in nutrition because participants’ environments must be tightly controlled so their food can be monitored down to the gram; in Hall’s studies, participants live at the NIH clinical center - essentially a hospital - for weeks at a time. The results of Hall’s first such trial were published in 2019 and showed that people who ate a diet of mostly ultraprocessed foods consumed an additional 500 calories a day and gained about 2 pounds, on average, over the course of two weeks, compared with when they ate diets composed mainly of minimally processed foods, matched for nutrients. The study “helped provide the causal link in the established epidemiological association between obesity and diets high in ultra-processed foods,” Hall told Kennedy and Bhattacharya in his letter. Nestle, a professor emerita at New York University and author of the book “Food Politics,” called it one of the most important nutrition studies done since the discovery of vitamins. On Thursday, she called Hall’s early retirement a “national tragedy,” writing that it casts doubt on the MAHA movement’s credibility. “I view his resignation under these circumstances as an act of extraordinary courage and scientific integrity,” Nestle wrote on her Food Politics blog. Hall, whose best-known work also includes a series of studies following the outcomes of participants in the show “The Biggest Loser,” has been in the midst of a follow-up study at NIH to understand what it is about ultraprocessed foods that causes people to overeat them. That’s despite, he wrote in his letter, a 30% cut to the beds in the NIH clinical center available to conduct the trials. “His study raises this question – ‘What if it is the processing?’ ” – that drives overeating of ultraprocessed foods, Mande said. “Then you have an administration coming in that’s saying the same thing, and you have a great story for them to tell: that the last administration dragged its feet on this. Kevin’s study was done, in 2019 it came out; it should have been replicated the next year, and hasn’t been.” Hall wrote that interim results from the ongoing study “suggest that we are making substantial progress identifying exactly how ultra-processed foods cause overeating and weight gain,” but he notes that “there is still so much more to learn.” Related video
      ‘Americans are going to suffer’: Medical professional reacts to NIH cuts During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy told lawmakers that the most important action the federal government could take to improve the nation’s nutrition would be “to deploy NIH and FDA to [do] the research to understand the relationship between these different food additives and chronic disease, so that Americans understand it.” “You should know what the impacts are on your family and on your health,” Kennedy said. Just over two months after Kennedy was sworn in, Hall – the NIH’s top nutrition researcher working on those answers – is leaving. In his letter, Hall noted “the short time period” of deadlines to accept voluntary early retirement, part of the federal government’s push to shed workers; HHS said it cut 25% of its staff through a combination of voluntary departures like Hall’s and a mass Reduction in Force this month. In his social media post Wednesday, Hall said he “felt compelled to accept early retirement to preserve health insurance for my family,” noting that he’d lose that benefit if he resigned later “in protest of any future meddling or censorship.” He said he doesn’t have plans for next steps in his career, given how quickly he had to make the decision. But in both his post and his letter to Kennedy and Bhattacharya, he emphasized that he hopes to go back. “Perhaps I could soon return to government service and lead an effort to expand on our research to rapidly determine what are the most important factors in our toxic food environment that are making Americans chronically sick,” Hall wrote last month. For now, he said, his experiences “have led me to believe that NIH may be a difficult place to continue the gold-standard unbiased science required to inform the needed transformation of our food supply to make Americans healthy.” This story has been updated with additional information.",,0.25191357731819153
"The Trump administration is formulating plans to cut roughly a third of the federal health budget, eliminate dozens of programs and vastly whittle down health agencies, according to an internal document reviewed by CNN. The preliminary memo, sent from White House budget officials to the Department of Health and Human Services, previews the administration’s plans to slash discretionary federal health spending and rework health agencies in the image of President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s “Make America Healthy Again” mandate. The document, dated April 10, could still be finalized with changes. If enacted as is, it could cut total federal health spending by tens of billions of dollars a year. It would also consolidate dozens of health programs and departments into the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA), a new entity unveiled by Kennedy during mass layoffs earlier this month. The plan calls for steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would see its budget reduced by more than 40% under the administration’s proposal. It also eliminates CDC’s global health center and programs focused on chronic disease prevention, and domestic HIV/AIDS prevention. While some of the agency’s work would be moved into new AHA centers, programs on gun violence, injury prevention, youth violence prevention, drowning, minority health and others would be eliminated entirely. Many of the staff in those CDC departments were laid off in the mass reduction-in-force announcements on April 1. The proposal would also eliminate a number of rural health programs at HHS, including grants and residency programs for rural hospitals and state offices. Other rural health efforts, such as black lung clinics, would remain but be housed in the new AHA’s primary care department. The proposed cuts could provide a blueprint for Republicans looking to slash federal spending. The president will send his budget request to Congress, which is wrangling over Republican plans to reduce the federal budget by up to $1.5 trillion. The Washington Post first reported on the proposed budget request. The preliminary plan would slash the National Institutes of Health’s budget by more than 40% and reduce its 27 research institutes and centers down to just eight. While the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Institute on Aging would be preserved. Institutes researching childhood illnesses, mental health, chronic disease, disabilities and substance abuse would be shuffled into five new entities: the National Institute on Body Systems, National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research and National Institute of Behavioral Health. The budget also assumes that the administration’s earlier attempt to cap indirect payments to universities at 15%, blocked by a court, would be in effect. Many of these payments have traditionally helped fund medical research. While NIH has historically enjoyed bipartisan support for funding increases, there have been growing calls among GOP lawmakers for reform. House Republican leaders proposed last year to consolidate the institutes into 15 entities but also suggested a slight budget increase in that plan. The proposal would also establish a salary cap for employees hired under Title 42, a National Institutes of Health provision that gives the agency more leeway to hire experts into senior roles. Many top officials, including the now-retired National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease director Anthony Fauci, are hired as Title 42 employees.

"Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. The winter flu season is still in full force, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, causing many sufferers to halt their exercise regimen. But not every illness requires you to set down your gym bag. While moderate to severe ailments require a certain amount of rest and recovery, mild illnesses may improve with movement. “To be totally inactive and bedridden has a negative impact on your immune system, energy levels and recovery ability,” said Walter Gjergja, cofounder of the fitness app Zing Coach who is based in Lugano, Switzerland. “It’s usually beneficial to have some activity, although of the appropriate quantity and quality.” The standard medical advice is that when your symptoms are above the neck (e.g., a tension headache, stuffy or runny nose, or minor sore throat), it’s fine to engage in mild to moderate exercise. But if your symptoms strike below the neck — think ailments such as chest congestion or an upset stomach — back off. Never exercise if you have a fever, which is a sign your body is fighting an infection or viral disease. The type of exercise you should do while battling a mild illness depends upon factors such as your typical activity level, the weather (if exercising outdoors), and your age and overall health. “If you have a mild to moderate illness, you can continue to exercise, but you should do less than you normally do,” said family physician Dr. Bruce Barrett, a professor and vice chair for research in the department of family medicine and community health   at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “If you normally run 10 miles per week, maybe run 5 if you have a mild cold. Just tamp it down.” Related article
      Physical decline is common as we age. These exercises can help mitigate the effects Going for a walk is one of the gentlest and healthiest forms of exercise, Gjergja said. But if the temperature is below about 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius), it’s better to exercise inside. “When the air is cold, it can irritate the lungs and bronchial area,” Gjergja said. “This could trigger coughing or emphasize any inflammation that was abating, and you could get sicker.” Pay attention to the air quality, too, Barrett said. If it’s poor, move indoors to protect your lungs. Gentle stretching is another great option for an active recovery, especially for those who do not exercise regularly, Gjergja said. Consider doing some shoulder rolls, ankle circles, leg raises or seated spinal twists. Practices such as yoga, qigong and tai chi are helpful, too. “These activities are very gentle in terms of energy expenditure,” Gjergja said, “but stimulate our circulation and benefit our body by moving all of our joints.” Related article
      Here’s how I learned to enjoy running after only a month of practice The key is not to overdo it, something avid exercisers struggle with when sickness strikes. “Those are the ones I worry more about,” Gjergja said. “They immediately want to return to their training, which brings the risk of slowing their recovery and having the illness recur. It’s just not worth the rewards, which are minimal.” In addition, heavy exercise done while experiencing a respiratory viral illness can lead to chronic fatigue and even exacerbate myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, according to a 2021 study published in the journal BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine. Once you are fully recovered, take a look at your exercise habits. If you haven’t been working out regularly, consider making it a habit to ward off future ailments. “People who exercise regularly have fewer and shorter illnesses,” Barrett said. He should know. Barrett led one study, published in 2012 in the journal Annals of Family Medicine, evaluating the possible preventive effects of meditation or exercise on acute respiratory illness. The results? Both practices significantly reduced the incidence, duration and severity of colds and influenza in the populations studied. Related article
      Yoga, Pilates, tai chi, qigong — what’s best for me? “For those who don’t regularly exercise, if they start exercising two or three or four hours per week, it can reduce their chance of getting sick,” Barrett said. “Covid and flu shots work, but exercise prevents all respiratory infections.” The link between exercise and illness prevention and recovery may be one reason qigong is increasingly studied today. A traditional Chinese practice, qigong combines gentle movements with breathing exercises and meditation. A growing number of studies show some causality between qigong and the immune system’s response and recovery from illness, Gjergja said. Related article
      Early research suggests why exercise is so protective against brain disease A June 2020 meta-analysis published in the journal Medicines indicated qigong and tai chi positively affect your body’s immune system and its response to inflammation. Qigong also was found helpful in treating arthritis, depression and anxiety, and hypertension in a May 2022 study published in the Biomedical Journal of Scientific & Technical Research. The bottom line? Get moving. “Some form of exercise will help improve your life and condition,” Gjergia said. “I’ve worked with people with mild to severe health issues, including heart conditions and strokes. For all of them, some type of exercise was helpful.” Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.",,0.22997811436653137
"Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. It may seem hard to believe, but snacking several times a day can boost your health and fitness — exercise snacking, that is. “Exercise snacks” are short bursts of activity — 30 seconds to five or 10 minutes max — that encompass almost any type of movement. Think climbing stairs, walking, doing squats or dancing. The term is thought to have been first used in 2007 by cardiologist Dr. Howard Hartley, who was then associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Today, numerous studies prove the value of these mini workouts. Related article
      Physical decline is common as we age. These exercises can help mitigate the effects Performing 15- to 30-second exercise snacks three times daily was shown to improve the cardiorespiratory fitness levels and exercise performance in inactive adults, according to a small January 2022 study published in the journal Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews. The “snacks” in the study were stair-climbing and cycling. Adults who reported they didn’t work out saw a 17% to 18% reduction in cancer incidence after they began doing just 3.4 to 3.6 minutes of vigorous physical activity daily, a July 2023 study of 22,398 people found. Their daily physical activity was done in bursts lasting less than one or two minutes. Hitting 4.5 minutes of vigorous, intermittent physical activity each day was associated with a 31% to 32% reduction in cancer incidence, according to the study published in JAMA Oncology. The benefits of movement extend to brain health, too. Doing even a small amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day, or adding a small amount to your current exercise regimen, reduces your risk of dementia, according to a March study in JAMDA: The Journal of the Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medical Association. Those who hadn’t been doing any moderate to vigorous exercise received the largest benefit. “Doing anything is better than doing nothing,” said Michael Betts, a personal trainer and director at TrainFitness who’s based in London. “As long as you’re moving some of the time, putting a little stress on your body, it will adapt and improve.” Exercise snacks are a favorite tool used by Dr. Supatra Tovar, owner of Dr. Supatra Tovar & Associates, a holistic health clinical psychology practice in Pasadena, California. “I’m a big proponent of behavior change that starts tiny,” Tovar said. “So I like to create behaviors with my clients that are easy, accessible and doable every to most every day of the week.” The key to making tiny, new changes stick is to tie them to a behavior you do every day at the same time, Tovar said. For example, if you immediately brush your teeth upon waking up, start doing a few jumping jacks or lunges as soon as you set down your toothbrush. Related article
      Alleviate the ache and strengthen your knees with the reverse lunge “When you incorporate exercise snacks as a habit, they start to become ingrained, and you’ll begin to see their lifelong benefits,” Tovar said. “Anyone I’ve given these to have reported back that they had no idea how much of a positive difference they would make.” Walking is one of the easiest exercise snacks, according to Tovar and Betts. It can entail a stroll around your neighborhood or just a lap around your living room. Once you get in the habit of walking a little each day, you can progress to doing intervals, increasing your pace for 20 seconds, slowing down for 10 and then repeating several times. “It pushes your body a little more each time,” Betts said, “after which your body adapts and improves.” Related article
      Walking just 5 minutes a day makes a difference But don’t rely just on walking. Wall push-ups will build strength in your arms, for example, while squats are great for beefing up your leg strength. If you want to be able to climb stairs without getting out of breath, start walking up and down stairs a little more quickly than you normally would. “There’s always an exercise snack that can help improve each part of your body in some way,” Betts said. You can also make any exercise snack more difficult if it becomes too easy. A wall push-up can progress to one performed on the floor, while a chair squat can become an air squat. An easy stroll can turn into a light jog. Exercise snacks don’t have to be a specific type of activity, either. “Cleaning your house is exercise,” said Tovar, who is a fan of NEAT movements. NEAT, or nonexercise activity thermogenesis, refers to the energy expended from all physical activities that aren’t structured exercise. Doing chores, playing with your kids and even fidgeting are all forms of NEAT. Tovar points to people living in “blue zones,” which are areas around the globe where people routinely live long and healthy lives, such as Okinawa, Japan, and the Italian island of Sardinia.

"Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts. Spring is in the air, but that’s not stopping fitness enthusiasts from wanting to crank up the heat — at least in the studio. No matter the temperature outside, heated yoga, Pilates or spin classes are drawing in those eager to sweat it out. These heated workouts are everywhere, with studio temperatures ranging from a toasty 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29.4 degrees Celsius) to more than 100 F (37.8 C). There might be something undeniably satisfying about working up a sweat, watching the droplets roll down your skin and leaving you with a red-faced glow. But does this trendy workout regimen lead to better workout results? Note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. Beyond the immediate feel-good factor, heated workouts may have some positive physical and mental perks. These workouts increase blood flow and warm muscle tissue, which can enhance flexibility, according to Dr. Dominic King, a sports medicine physician at the Cleveland Clinic. In addition to reducing stiffness and potentially preventing injuries, the elevated temperature slightly boosts cardiovascular demand, possibly burning more calories than a standard workout at a regular temperature. However, heat alone doesn’t guarantee better fitness results. Consistency, technique and overall effort are still important. “Heated workouts add intensity, but turning up the thermostat doesn’t automatically turn up your fitness gains — sweat smartly, not just profusely,” King said. Related article
      ‘Exercise snacks’ — even a few minutes a day — can boost your health You might also get a small mental boost from the heat-related endorphin release, which King said can offer short-term relaxation similar to the effects of sitting in a sauna. But despite their popularity, heated workouts aren’t a fitness or health cure-all. In fact, working out in higher temperatures can reduce exercise intensity, according to S. Tony Wolf, an assistant professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Georgia. He added that higher temperatures can increase physiological strain, which could diminish the quality and any smaller benefits of heated exercise. “Regular exercise routines and mindful movement in comfortable environments can offer comparable, and more sustainable, health benefits,” King said. If you already love hot classes or are curious to try one, your safety should come first. Eelevated temperatures can increase the risk of dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and fainting or exacerbate underlying heart, respiratory or kidney issues, King said. Before heading into class, it’s essential to stay hydrated. About two to three hours before a class, King recommends drinking 16 to 20 ounces of water, plus another 8 ounces about 30 minutes beforehand. As soon as the workout is over, replenish your fluids with 16 to 24 ounces of water, ideally with some form of electrolytes — sodium, potassium and magnesium — to replace lost minerals from extreme sweating. During class, be sure to look out for warning signs that your body is struggling to handle the heat, such as dizziness, nausea, confusion, rapid heartbeat or fatigue, Wolf said. Additionally, if you experience severe or unusual chest, joint or muscle pain, stop immediately and seek medical advice to rule out any underlying conditions before returning to intense workouts, King said. Related article
      Don’t overdo it, but light exercise can help with minor illness While young, healthy adults can generally handle the heat, some people should proceed with caution — or avoid these workouts altogether. Older adults and individuals with cardiovascular disease should check with their doctor before trying heated workouts, as the added heart strain can be dangerous, Wolf said. Pregnant people, especially in the first trimester, are at risk of overheating, which can affect fetal development, and they should avoid these classes. Anyone managing chronic health conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes or asthma, should also be mindful of the risks. “Just because it’s popular, doesn’t mean it’s right for everyone,” King said. “Fitness should enhance your health, never jeopardize it.”",,0.21357132494449615

"Editor’s note: Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.” When your shoulders feel stiff, stretching might seem like the obvious answer. But in many cases, stretching is just a temporary fix rather than a real solution — and when it comes to the shoulders, stretching can even make things worse. Understanding why your shoulders feel stiff is key to addressing the problem. Instead of passive stretching, a more effective approach involves doing targeted mobility, strength and breathing exercises to correct muscle imbalances, improve joint stability and enhance overall function. The shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in the body, allowing for an extensive range of motion. But that mobility comes at a cost — it’s also the least stable joint. Unlike the hip, which has a deep ball-and-socket structure for support, the shoulder’s shallow socket depends on a network of muscles, tendons and ligaments for stability. The scapula (shoulder blade), clavicle (collarbone) and humerus (upper arm bone) rely heavily on the coordination of muscles like the rotator cuff, trapezius, serratus anterior and deltoids to control movement and maintain joint integrity. When the deep stabilizing muscles of the shoulder, such as the lower trapezius, serratus anterior and rotator cuff, aren’t firing properly, larger muscles such as the upper trapezius (located at the side of the neck and top of the back) and pectoralis major (upper chest) tend to take over. This creates excessive tension and poor joint positioning, leading to stiffness and discomfort. These imbalances are common in people who spend long hours sitting at a desk, hunching over devices, or repeatedly performing overhead motions in sports or workouts. Related article
      Tight hip flexors? This simple move restores mobility in minutes Stretching tight-feeling shoulders might provide temporary relief but doesn’t address the root cause. In fact, aggressive stretching can increase instability, putting more strain on the joint that can lead to pain and injury. In my work with professional baseball teams over the past two decades, I’ve seen firsthand how well-intentioned stretching can sometimes do more harm than good. Years ago, many teams encouraged pitchers to perform the sleeper stretch — a position in which you lie on your side and use your top arm to push the bottom arm into internal rotation — to improve shoulder mobility. But over time, mobility experts realized this stretch was making the shoulder joint excessively loose and unstable, increasing injury risk rather than preventing it. That shift in approach reinforced an important lesson: Instead of stretching shoulders, the focus should be on restoring proper muscle activation, optimizing alignment and enhancing movement patterns. To effectively relieve shoulder stiffness and restore healthy function, you need a multifaceted approach that includes: Here are four exercises that cover those bases and can be done as a stand-alone routine two to three times per week or incorporated into your regular workouts. Be sure to check with your doctor before starting any new exercise program. Stop immediately if you experience pain. Lie on your back with knees bent and feet hip-width apart. Hold a foam yoga block or rolled towel between your knees. Place your hands on your lower ribs to monitor their movement: ribs moving inward on exhales and outward on inhales. Exhale fully, engaging your core as your ribs move inward and your entire rib cage moves down toward your waist. At the end of the exhale, tuck your tailbone and lift your hips 3 to 4 inches off the floor, keeping your lower back flat. Hold this position for five deep breaths, maintaining core and glute engagement. Rest for 15 to 30 seconds and repeat for a total of two sets and 10 breaths. Related article
      Forget crunches: The smarter way to strengthen your core Why it works: This positional breathing exercise improves deep core activation and breathing mechanics, helping to reduce compensatory tension in the shoulders that hinders mobility while optimizing rib cage positioning to stabilize the shoulder blades, collarbones and upper arm bones. Stand with your back against a wall, feet 6 to 8 inches away, knees slightly bent. Press your entire back and head against the wall. Engage your core to help keep your lower ribs down and lower back pressing into the wall. Raise your arms to shoulder height, elbows bent at 90 degrees with back of hands, elbows and shoulders touching the wall. Inhale as you slide your arms upward until maintaining contact becomes difficult.Exhale as you return to the start position. Although this exercise looks simple, maintaining all contact points, especially keeping your low back on the wall, can be quite challenging. Contact is more important than how much you move your arms. Complete a total of five repetitions coordinated with your breath, focusing on drawing your lower ribs in, back and down with each exhale. Do two to three sets, resting about 30 seconds in between. Why it works: This mobility and stability exercise improves the function of the muscles that move and stabilize the shoulder blades, releasing compensatory tension in the front of the shoulders and chest to counteract slouching. Place a kettlebell weighing 5 to 20 pounds on the floor with a pad or folded towel in front of it. Select an appropriate weight for your fitness level — nothing too heavy. Kneel on the pad so you have your back to the weight. Your feet should be hip-width apart with your toes curled forward. Sit back on your heels and reach behind you with both hands to grab the kettlebell handle. Exhale as you engage your core and push your hips forward, lifting the kettlebell behind you as you rise into a tall kneeling position. Keep your shoulders, ribs and hips stacked over your knees without arching your back. Hold the kettlebell with straight arms, keeping your shoulders open. Maintain this posture for five deep breaths, using exhales to keep your rib cage down and inhales to expand your lower ribs. Take a one- or two-minute break between repetitions, repeating one or two times. Why it works: This strengthening exercise improves postural control and shoulder stability by creating a neutral, stacked position with the shoulders, rib cage and hips. The movement also serves as a positional breathing exercise that leverages breathwork to restore alignment and alleviate compensatory tension. Lie on your right side with knees bent at 90 degrees in front of your hips, placing a yoga block or pillow between your knees. Use a pad or pillow under your head to keep your neck aligned with your spine. Extend both arms forward at shoulder height, palms together. Inhale as you rotate your left arm in a circular motion overhead and then continuing down toward the floor behind you on your left side. Turn your head to follow the movement. Rotate from your shoulder and the middle of your back, not your lower back. Exhale and place your right hand on the outside of your left leg to help keep your lower body stable. Hold for two breaths, then return to the start. Repeat one or two times before switching sides. Related article
      Don’t overdo it, but light exercise can help with minor illness Why it works: This mobility exercise uses rotation to enhance shoulder range of motion and reduce compensatory tension. If you’ve been stretching your shoulders to relieve stiffness but aren’t seeing results — or worse, are feeling more discomfort — it’s time to rethink your approach. By practicing the targeted strength, mobility and breathing exercises above, you can address the root causes of the tension, improve function and prevent future discomfort.

You’re scrolling through your phone when you stumble upon the next viral trend: an influencer claiming that following their incredibly strict diet will help you achieve their jaw-dropping physique. Or you see a fresh-faced runner swearing you can run a marathon without any training — just like they did. Whether or not you’re actively searching for wellness advice, it’s nearly impossible to avoid hearing about the latest health craze making bold guarantees of transformation. As you wonder if these claims hold any truth, you might also question why people often feel motivated to dive into intense challenges — when seemingly simple habits, such as getting enough sleep or eating more vegetables, often feel much harder to tackle. Many of us are drawn to these extreme challenges because we’re craving radical change, hoping it will help prove something to ourselves or to others, experts say. “We always see these kinds of challenges as opportunities for growth, particularly if we’re in a phase of our life where we’ve let ourselves go,” said Dr. Thomas Curran, associate professor of psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science and an expert on perfectionism. “Maybe we feel that we need to be healthier, or we just had a breakup or (major) life event.” Related article
      Heated workouts and hot yoga are all the rage. But are they actually good for you? With social media amplifying these movements, it’s easy to see why people are increasingly drawn to the idea of achieving the “perfect” version of themselves. But before jumping into a new wellness challenge, it’s important to take a moment, reflect on your goals, and consider where you’re starting from. With health influencers raising the bar for success, the wellness space now often feels like a performative space where people strive to showcase peak physical and mental strength. While seeing others’ achievements can be motivating, it can also be discouraging if your progress doesn’t match theirs. Each person is chasing the perfect version of themselves — whether it’s a body or a lifestyle — which is dangerous because this is typically an impossible or dangerous version to achieve, Curran said. He added that this type of comparison creates a dangerous cycle in which people constantly feel dissatisfied with their own progress. “It’s a fantasy in many ways, and once you start chasing after it, you constantly find yourself embroiled in a sense of doubt and deficit,” he said. Curran also noted that wellness challenges can be particularly damaging for women who struggle with perfectionism, as they tend to be bombarded with impossible beauty standards and societal expectations. Renee McGregor, a UK-based dietitian who specializes in eating disorders and athlete performance, encourages people to approach wellness trends with curiosity and skepticism. That’s because some influencers and celebrities could be promoting products because there’s a financial benefit for them. “The thing to ask yourself about the person you’re taking advice from is what do they gain from it?” McGregor said. “If they are going to gain financially, then you know that they (could be willing) to sell you a lie.” Related article
      ‘Exercise snacks’ — even a few minutes a day — can boost your health Whether you want to try a new challenge or product that promises amazing results, McGregor suggests doing your research and seeking diverse perspectives, including consulting with doctors when possible. If you’re the type of person who thrives on challenges and pushing your limits, this doesn’t mean you need to shy away from wellness challenges altogether. But before diving in, take a step back and ask yourself if you’re pursuing the challenge for the right reasons, McGregor said. Some people want to try these challenges because they believe something is missing from their life, and they’re looking to attain “worth” or receive validation, McGregor noted. A good way to assess your motivation is by considering whether the challenge will benefit your health or if it’s about showcasing your accomplishments on social media or some other reason. Before trying any new trend, make sure you have the foundation to handle it and be aware of any potential risks, McGregor said. For casual runners, this might mean signing up for a 5K but building your endurance gradually while incorporating other strength training exercises into your routine. For more intense challenges, such as a marathon, McGregor encourages people to consult with professionals or a coach who can monitor your progress and condition along the way. Both McGregor and Curran emphasize the importance of fostering sustainable health habits before embarking on more extreme challenges. Rather than chasing the idea of being “healthy,” McGregor suggests focusing on actual healthful behaviors and starting small. If you’re a highly sedentary person and want to add more movement to your day, try doing lunges while brushing your teeth or taking short walks throughout your typical routine. Related article
      Move better and sidestep injury with the side lunge McGregor suggests other small changes, too, including eating vegetables several times a day, basing meals around whole grains and having a handful of nuts each day. “These are little changes that allow people to reap the rewards of brain health and physical health instead of drinking five juices a day, which is never going to be the answer to your overall health,” she said. Most importantly, wellness should be giving people pleasure, not about reaching a certain number on the scale or looking a certain way to achieve ultimate happiness, McGregor said. “There’s a lot we can do with our psychological health, and I think (we) need to realize that comparison never really benefits (us),” McGregor said. “I think sometimes it’s really important for us to be in the (moment) and rest with what’s going on.”",,0.2636583149433136
"(CNN) — Once you have embarked upon a new exercise regimen, most people hope to see results almost immediately. Yet whether you’re looking to drop a few pounds, gain muscle or fit into your favorite pair of jeans, it can seem to take forever. This is especially true if you’ve started this journey with your spouse or a friend, who may be quickly seeing positive results. “How soon you’ll see changes really depends on the person, the type of exercise they’re doing and how consistently they’re doing it,” said Angie Asche, a registered dietitian based in Lincoln, Nebraska, and founder of Eleat Sports Nutrition, a company that helps athletes improve their performance through nutrition. “It depends on what your diet is like, too. But give it at least two to four weeks.” Related article
      ‘Exercise snacks’ — even a few minutes a day — can boost your health For many people, changes can take more like six to 12 weeks, said Tina Fennelly, a certified personal trainer with Aviv Clinics in The Villages, Florida. That’s because so many factors are in play, including age, sex and metabolism. Men, for example, tend to have a higher metabolic rate than women, which is the total amount of energy, or calories, your body uses per day. This is because men are typically larger than women and have more muscle mass, and bigger organs and beefier muscles require more calories to work. While waiting a month or two to see visible results from your hard work can seem like a long time, it’s worth it because exercise brings plenty of invisible results, both experts agreed. Regular physical activity reduces your risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, infectious diseases and even some cancers, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exercising also strengthens your bones and muscles, improves your cognitive skills, and even enhances the quality of your sleep. Significant reductions in resting blood pressure also occur after performing a variety of different forms of exercise, with running and wall squats being especially helpful, according to a 2023 meta-analysis published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Blood pressure changes can be immediate, too. “They can even occur the first day because of the improved blood flow that will happen,” Asche said. “This is regardless of whether you’re doing strength training, cardio or a combination.” Speeding up your progress If you’re willing to work harder to see physical changes more quickly, that’s certainly possible. “If you’re really trying to make body composition changes, focus more on higher-intensity exercises like running than, say, yoga,” Asche said, the latter being a lower-impact exercise that helps more with improving your sleep and mood. It will also help if you move more throughout the day, not just during your exercise session. So schedule a five-minute walking break every hour, stand up at your desk or pace around your home during phone calls. “It doesn’t seem like a lot, but this extra activity all adds up,” Asche said. Related article
      Here’s how I learned to enjoy running after only a month of practice Reducing your caloric intake even a small amount — such as 250 to 500 calories per week — can help you drop an additional half a pound or pound per week, Fennelly said. Keep in mind, too, that once your body begins to build lean muscle mass, which occurs mainly from strength training, your resting metabolic rate will increase. “That means after you leave the gym, you’ll have a higher calorie burn,” Fennelly said. Food can be a game changer, too Choosing the proper foods to eat can also help you shed pounds and feel more comfortable in your clothing. “Focus on whole foods as much as you can,” Asche said. Whole foods are unprocessed or minimally processed foods left in their natural state, or close to it. Think fresh fruits and veggies, eggs, legumes, nuts, and seeds. “Minimally processed foods will give you the proper fiber, iron and nutrients,” Asche said. “Overprocessed foods lack nutrients, so we’re not satisfied when we eat them, and so we have a tendency to overeat.” Another hack is to pair your new fitness routine with an activity you enjoy, Fennelly said. “I tell my clients that once you leave here, find something else you enjoy to keep you active and engaged, such as pickleball or biking.” Related article

It’s also the No. 1 thing you can do to increase your longevity.” “And that’s what we want, right?” Asche said. “Increasing your longevity is the biggest reason to exercise, even more so than losing a little bit of fat.” Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.

"I drag myself out of bed in the morning and immediately make a promise that I’m going to go to bed earlier that night. Throughout the first half of my day, I’m considering if a nap might be in the cards for the afternoon. But once bedtime rolls around, I find I couldn’t be more wide awake. While this loop I have found myself in is not a fun one, feeling tired at the “wrong” time is a common complaint  that patients share with their sleep doctors, said Dr. Sonja Schütz, a neurologist specializing in sleep medicine and an associate professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Related article
      What’s ‘sleepmaxxing’? Experts weigh in on the social media trend Often, a person who struggles with this problem could be perceived as lazy, especially when the issue is commonly seen in teenagers, said Dr. Allison Harvey, a professor of psychology and the director of the Golden Bear Sleep and Mood Research Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley. But the issue is not indicative of willpower or lack thereof, but a sign that someone may be dealing with an issue such as bad sleep hygiene, disturbed sleep throughout the night, or an underlying sleep disorder, Schütz said. It’s worth finding the source of the problems, since getting quality sleep is essential for a person’s overall health and ability to function. “Sleep and having a regularized circadian system (a person’s internal biological 24-hour clock) is essential for our mental health, our physical health, our cognitive health — our ability to think, to solve problems, to be creative — and also our social and behavioral health, Harvey said. “When we’re sleeping well, we’re less likely to be risk taking, impulsive, (and) we’re more likely to get along with people.” Here’s what to do if you find yourself awake or tired at the wrong time of the day. If someone consistently wakes up tired, they first need to start tracking their sleep patterns— when they get into bed every night and when they wake up, said Dr. Michelle Drerup, director of the behavioral sleep medicine program at the Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center in Ohio. Likely, the issue could be that someone’s circadian rhythm is shifted so that they produce melatonin later than the time they need to go to sleep. In the morning, that melatonin could still be in production mode, causing sleep inertia, a temporary state of grogginess upon waking up, she added. Related article
      The potential dangers of sleep trackers, according to experts Whether you’re a night owl or early bird, which are common descriptors of a person’s chronotype, is directly correlated to a person’s circadian rhythm and the body’s natural inclination to sleep or be alert at certain times of the day. To shift this to better fit someone’s work schedule, consistency is key, Harvey said. But the sleep-wake cycle takes time to tweak and cannot be done in large increments — Harvey recommends going to bed 15 to 30 minutes earlier each night until your body adjusts to the schedule you need. On the weekends, people who are consistently tired throughout the weekdays tend to sleep in, but this routine change will only make it harder to wake up when Monday morning rolls around, Drerup said. She recommends that a person stick to their usual schedule and not sleep in for more than an hour past their usual weekday wake-up time. Other important sleep hygiene habits to keep in mind include how late someone is consuming caffeine and certain foods, heir screen-time habits and the type of media they’re using before bed that could be alerting or anxiety-inducing, Drerup said. For a better wind-down routine, aim to turn off electronics one or two hours before bed, dim the lights in the house and do a calming activity like reading, Schütz said. Similarly, teenagers tend to multitask a lot of different activities before bedtime, such as homework and using social media, which can make winding down difficult, especially as they transition to an age where they get less deep sleep than they did as children, Harvey said. In the morning, it could help to stick to a routine that helps the body and brain wake up. “Do something that signals (that) it’s morning — whether that’s going and washing your face, splashing water on your face, brushing your teeth — something to start that forward momentum,” Drerup said.

      Resistance training is the right way to tire your brain and body for better sleep, according to a study Also, avoiding the snooze button, which harms your sleep. On the other hand, getting light exposure in the morning after waking up can help people feel more awake, she added. Getting in physical activity throughout the day can help your body feel more tired at night, especially when many jobs in the digital age involve a lot of sitting down, Harvey added. Experts agree that the recommended amount of sleep for adults is seven to nine hours per night, but that can look slightly different from person to person, Schütz said. “It’s very common that people are sleep deprived without being aware of that, because their body needs at least nine hours to feel really rested.” By tracking your sleep and learning the amount where your body feels rested, you can start to establish new habits and have an easier time getting up in the morning, she added. While napping has been found to be beneficial for cognitive abilities like memory and function, the timing is important — longer naps and napping later in the afternoon could cause someone to feel more alert when bedtime rolls around, Drerup said. A good rule of thumb is to keep naps between 20 and 30 minutes, Schütz said. Fogginess in the morning is a common symptom in people who have a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea, and a visit with a physician might be needed to rule out underlying disorders, Schütz said. Sometimes, sleep medications such as over-the-counter sleep aids or allergy medication can cause a hangover effect, which could make waking up in the morning difficult, she added. Mental health could be a factor, too. Someone who is depressed can often wake up feeling fatigued, and the sleep inertia that normally lasts around 20 minutes for someone who is not depressed can instead last several hours, Harvey said.

"When Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency medicine physician, thinks about her time working at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, one case always comes rushing back: Two-year-old. Gunshot wound. Chest. ETA five minutes. The child was rushed to the emergency department after being accidentally shot by an older sibling who was playing with a gun that was left unlocked in the house. “I’ll never forget the … child on the stretcher and the blood-curdling screams of the parent outside the room, lying on the floor, distraught,” Johns said. Every 30 minutes, an emergency department treats another firearm injury, according to a new analysis from researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that looked at 10 jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia. Related article
      Born from the tragedy of gun violence, this program teaches children how to stop a wound from bleeding out But cuts from the US Department of Health and Human Services and proposed changes to the federal budget could threaten research that reveals these kinds of firearm injury patterns. Experts say it would be nearly impossible to replicate the scale and scope of the timely firearm research the federal government is able to conduct. The recent study, which was published last week in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, says that the firearm injury visits are not evenly distributed. There were more firearm injury presentations at night, on the weekends and on some holidays, like Independence Day and New Year’s Eve. Experts say the results are not surprising but that the findings from this analysis — which the authors say is the largest of its kind to use timely data in urban and rural areas — can inform staffing to provide better care. “Knowing when firearm injury emergency department visits are higher can help inform decisions about physician staffing, resource allocation, and trauma preparedness to reduce delays in care and use resources most effectively,” the CDC said in an email to CNN. Johns says the young child she treated survived because there was well-prepared staff at the hospital’s Level 1 trauma center. “Just the sheer number of staff – there must have been 15 people, with the appropriate team inside the room and at the bedside,” Johns said. This included not only doctors and nurses but also blood bank runners, lab runners and many others who were ready for the child to arrive. “Trauma care takes a village,” said Dr. Katherine Hoops, who leads the Clinical Programs and Practice Team at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Gun Violence Solutions. Mental health professionals and social workers are also critical to have on staff for these responses, she noted. Related article
      Nearly 100,000 children in the US lost a parent to a drug overdose or gun violence in 2020, study finds Firearm injuries are the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US. Emergency medical service encounters for firearm injury spiked in 2021 and remain higher than before the Covid-19 pandemic. Firearm suicides have continued to rise and are now higher than at any other point in the past 50 years. The study analyzed over 93,000 emergency department visits for firearm injury through data from the CDC’s Firearm Injury Surveillance Through Emergency Rooms, or FASTER, which collects real time data from select jurisdictions. Data from 2018 through 2023 in Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and DC was included. The analysis specifically showed that most of the patients with gunshot wounds arrived at the emergency department between 2:30 and 3 a.m., and the slowest times were between 10 and 10:30 a.m. The peaks were highest overnights from Friday into Saturday and Saturday into Sunday. The case rates were highest in July and lowest in February. Although emergency departments might have adequate staff at off times, other hospital resources might be limited at night and on weekends, which could be a problem in these emergencies, Johns said. Experts say there can still be deviations from these patterns, underscoring the importance of continued emergency room staffing. The peaks can also differ for firearm injuries in pediatric patients, Johns explained. Future of firearm research is uncertain The FASTER program is run through the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, a division of the CDC that was heavily targeted during federal job cuts this month. More than 40 health organizations have urged US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reinstate the center, which lost more than 200 employees, according to Sharon Gilmartin, executive director of the Safe States Alliance, which is leading the newly formed coalition.

      US has the highest rate of gun-related deaths in more than 25 years, new CDC data shows “No other federal agency collects, analyzes and links hospital and public health data sets to help illustrate a comprehensive picture of the circumstances that lead to injury and violence,” the groups wrote in a letter to Kennedy. “State, local, municipal governments and universities rely on these data to inform the design and implementation of targeted injury and violence prevention efforts.” The CDC says that FASTER has not been affected and continues to be operational. The database initiative was funded in 2023 through August 2028, according to the agency, but continuation of this work is contingent on future appropriations from Congress. Although the surveillance branch has remained intact, other research and programming staff from the center has largely been let go, according to a former employee of the ﻿National Center for Injury Prevention and Control who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “Even if the data sets remain, they will be rendered useless because they have nobody to clean the data, analyze the data and tell you what it means,” Gilmartin said.

      HHS removes surgeon general’s gun violence advisory from its website Firearm research has been stunted for years because of the Dickey Amendment, which was introduced in 1996 and prohibited the use of federal dollars on research that may promote gun control, according to the former National Center for Injury Prevention and Control employee. The budget for fiscal year 2020 reintroduced funding for gun violence research for the CDC and the US National Institutes of Health. “As a result of banning us from doing that work, the field of firearm violence is pretty far behind,” the former employee said. Now, experts are worried that this work could fall even further amid possible cuts laid out in an internal document reviewed by CNN last week. The document showed that the Trump administration is formulating plans to slash federal health spending and consolidate dozens of health programs into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity that Kennedy announced during the layoffs. The plan could still change, but the document currently indicates that while some National Center for Injury Prevention and Control programs will become part of AHA’s primary care programs, others will be completely eliminated. The center’s Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research is among those with a zeroed-out budget in the proposal.",,0.2715047299861908

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. I recently helped my mom sort through boxes she inherited when my grandparents passed away. One box was labeled — either ironically or genuinely — “toothpick holders and other treasures.” Inside were many keepsakes from moments now lost to history — although we found no toothpick holders. My favorite of the items we sorted through was a solitary puzzle piece, an artifact reflecting my late grandmother’s penchant for hiding the final piece to a jigsaw puzzle just to swoop in at the last moment and finish it. After several hours of reminiscing, my mom and I threw away 90% of what we had sorted. “Why did I keep this?” is a question I hear frequently, both from my family and friends and from patients. I am a licensed clinical psychologist whose research focuses on the characterization, assessment and treatment of hoarding disorder, particularly for adults 60 years of age or older. As such, I spend a great deal of my time thinking about this question. READ MORE: Feeling controlled by the chaos in your home? 4 ways to rein in clutter and stay tidy Hoarding disorder is a psychiatric condition defined by urges to save items and difficulty discarding current possessions. For adults with “clinically severe” hoarding disorder, this leads to a level of household clutter that impairs daily functioning and can even create a fire hazard. In my professional experience, however, many adults struggle with clutter even if they do not meet the clinical criteria for hoarding disorder. READ MORE: Psychological ‘specialness spirals’ can make ordinary items feel like treasures — and may explain how clutter accumulates Holding on to things that have sentimental value or could be useful in the future is a natural part of growing older. For some people, though, this tendency to hold on to objects grows over time, to the point that they eventually do meet criteria for hoarding disorder. Age-related changes in executive function may help explain the increase in prevalence of hoarding disorder as we get older; increasing difficulty with decision-making in general also affects decisions around household clutter. Related article
      Anxiety can be debilitating. Controlling it starts with this simple step, Martha Beck says The traditional model behind hoarding disorder suggests that difficulty with discarding comes from distress during decision-making. However, my research shows that this may be less true of older adults. When I was a graduate student, I conducted a study in which we asked adults with hoarding disorder to spend 15 minutes making decisions about whether to keep or discard various items brought from their home. Participants could sort whatever items they wanted. Most chose to sort paper items such as old mail, cards or notes. We found that age was associated with lower levels of distress during the task, such that participants who were older tended to feel less stressed when making the decision about what to keep and what to discard. We also found that many participants, particularly those who were older, actually reported positive emotions while sorting their items. In new research publishing soon, my current team replicated this finding using a home-based version of the task. This suggests that fear of making the wrong decision isn’t a universal driver of our urge to save items. In fact, a study my team published in August 2024 with adults over 50 with hoarding disorder suggests that altruism, a personality trait of wanting to help others, may explain why some people keep items that others might discard. My colleagues and I compared our participants’ personality profiles with that of adults in the general population of the same gender and age group. Compared with the general population, participants with hoarding disorder scored almost universally high on altruism. Altruism also comes up frequently in my clinical work with older adults who struggle with clutter. People in our studies often tell me that they have held onto something out of a sense of responsibility, either for the item itself or to the environment. “I need it to go to a good home” and “my grandmother gave this to me” are sentiments we commonly hear. Thus, people may keep things not out of fear of losing them but because saving them is consistent with their values. Related article
      Unsubscribe from everything to start controlling the tech in your life, new book says In a 2024 study, my team demonstrated that taking a values-based approach to decluttering helps older adults to decrease household clutter and increases their positive affect, a state of mind characterized by feelings such as joy and contentment. Clinicians visited the homes of older adults with hoarding disorder for one hour per week for six weeks. At each visit, the clinicians used a technique called motivational interviewing to help participants talk through their decisions while they sorted household clutter. We found that having participants start with identifying their values allowed them to maintain focus on their long-term goals. Too often, people focus on the immediate ability of an object to “spark joy” and forget to consider whether an object has greater meaning and purpose. Values are the abstract beliefs that we humans use to create our goals. Values are whatever drives us and can include family, faith or frivolity. READ MORE: Japan’s ‘waste not, want not’ philosophy has deep religious and cultural roots, from monsters and meditation to Marie Kondo’s tidying up Because values are subjective, what people identify as important to keep is also subjective. For example, the dress I wore to my sister’s wedding reminded me of a wonderful day. However, when it no longer fit I gave it away because doing so was more consistent with my values of utility and helpfulness: I wanted the dress to go to someone who needed it and would use it. Someone who more strongly valued family and beauty might have prioritized keeping the dress because of the aesthetics and its link to a family event. Additionally, we found that instead of challenging the reasons a person might have for keeping an item, it is helpful to instead focus on eliciting their reasons for discarding it and the goals they have for their home and their life. Related article
      These people stopped procrastinating. You can too with this advice, they say My research on using motivational interviewing for decluttering and my observations from a current clinical trial on the approach point to some practical steps people can take to declutter their home. Although my work has been primarily with older adults, these tips should be helpful for people of all ages. Start with writing out your values. Every object in your home should feel value-consistent for you. For example, if tradition and faith are important values for you, you might be more inclined to hold onto a cookbook that was made by the elders at your church and more able to let go of a cookbook you picked up on a whim at a bookstore. If, instead, health and creativity are your core values, it might be more important to hold onto a cookbook of novel ways to sneak more vegetables into your diet. READ MORE: My possessions spark joy! How can I declutter? Defining value-consistent goals for using your space can help to maintain motivation as you declutter. Are you clearing off your desk so you can work more efficiently? Making space on kitchen counters to bake cookies with your grandchildren? Remember that sometimes your values will conflict. At those moments, it may help to reflect on whether keeping or discarding an object will bring you closer to your goals for the space. Similarly, remember that values are subjective. If you are helping a loved one declutter, maintain a curious, nonjudgmental attitude. Where you might see a box filled with junk, your grandmother might see something filled with “toothpick holders and other treasures.” For additional resources and information on hoarding disorder, visit the International OCD Foundation website.

Do you ever wonder what it was like to be a baby? But no matter how hard you try, you can’t remember any of the details? It’s not that you don’t have memories from infancy — it’s that you simply can’t access them later in life, new research shows. The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, examined 26 infants ranging from 4.2 to 24.9 months, split into two age groups: those younger than 12 months and those 12 to 24 months. During the experiment, babies were placed in an fMRI machine and shown a series of unique images for two seconds each. Researchers aimed to record activity in the hippocampus — the portion of the brain associated with emotions, memory and the autonomic nervous system. “The hippocampus is a deep brain structure that is not visible to standard methods, so we had to develop a new approach for conducting memory experiments with babies inside an MRI machine,” said Dr. Nick Turk-Browne, lead study author and professor in the department of psychology at Yale University, via email. “This kind of research has previously been done mostly while infants are asleep, because they wiggle a lot, cannot follow instructions and have short attention spans.” Dr. Simona Ghetti, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, Davis, whose research focuses on the development of memory in childhood, acknowledged that while many studies have already demonstrated infants’ capacity to encode memories, this latest research is unique in that it links memory encoding to hippocampal activation. Ghetti was not involved in the study. Related article
      Baby food labels will reveal levels of lead and other heavy metals for first time After a momentary delay, the babies were then shown two images side by side: one of familiar images they had seen before and one that was new. Researchers tracked the babies’ eye movements, noting which image they focused on longer. If an infant spent more time looking at the familiar image, it suggested they recognized it, indicating memory recall. If they didn’t show any preference, it likely meant their memory was less developed, according to the study. “Eye movements have been used in hundreds of studies on infant memory and  categorization,” Ghetti said via email. “Infants look at what they find interesting, and researchers have long leveraged this spontaneous behavior to derive information about memory functioning.” Once they collected the initial data, the team analyzed fMRI scans of babies who looked at the familiar image longer, comparing them with those who had no preference. Trials were excluded if the baby wasn’t focused on the screen and moved or blinked excessively. The findings revealed that the hippocampus was more active in older infants when encoding memories. Additionally, only older infants exhibited activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, which plays a key role in memory-related decision-making and recognition. “One thing we have learned about memory in adults is that the information we tend to capture and encode into memory are things that are highly relevant to our experience,” said Dr. Lila Davachi, a professor in the department of psychology at Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. “The amazing thing about this study is convincingly showing hippocampal encoding processes in babies for stimuli that are, in some sense, unimportant to them.” Related article
      Nearly two-thirds of supermarket baby foods are unhealthy, study finds Though it’s still unclear why memory encoding seems to be stronger in babies more than 12 months old, it’s likely a result of major alterations taking place in the body. “The infant brain undergoes many perceptual, linguistic, motor, biological and other changes around this time, including the rapid anatomical growth of the hippocampus,” Turk-Browne said. Turk-Browne and his team are actively working to test why the brain is unable to retrieve these early memories in life, but he speculates that the brain processing in infants may suggest the hippocampus isn’t receiving the accurate “search terms” to find the memory as it was stored based on the experiences the baby was having at the time. Ghetti encourages parents to think about the impact infancy has on their children, even if the children can’t retrieve memories they experienced at such an early age. Babies are learning an enormous amount at this age, which is how they begin to take in an entire language by associating sounds with meanings, Ghetti said. She added that infants are also forming expectations around their family members and studying properties of objects and the world around them. Parents often see this learned behavior when they sing the same song or read the same book, which Davachi noted produces a familiar response in older children. “Using repetition with babies will open up a greater connection between parent and baby,” she said via email.

      Using marijuana during pregnancy may heighten risk for baby Even though you can’t recall those earliest memories as an adult, it’s fair to say that you’re learning from those experiences, which can be true for both neutral and emotional information, Ghetti said. “This can remind parents that infancy is not idle time and that infants are learning a great deal,” Ghetti said. “Offering opportunities for visual exploration may be important for cultivating learning skills.”",,0.18299293518066406

Whether your politics make you anxious or exhilarated by the events of the day, there’s no doubt that change and uncertainty breed stress. Stress, of course, can disrupt sleep. For some, that stress can lead to insomnia, an inability to fall or stay asleep or waking up much earlier than desired. Chronic insomnia may lead to serious health issues, including heart attacks and stroke. “Everyone has a specific threshold for insomnia, and sometimes precipitating factors can break through the threshold and you can’t sleep. The stressors could be personal, professional, environmental, even political,” said sleep researcher Dr. Ana Krieger, a professor of clinical medicine in the departments of medicine, neurology and genetic medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. Cases of insomnia have tended to rise during previous political and societal upheaval, said Michelle Drerup, a psychologist in the sleep disorders clinic of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. “We’ve seen this throughout the past several decades,” Drerup said. “Oftentimes it’s people who are vulnerable or people who already have occasional difficulties, and this tips them over the edge.” Good sleepers may be more immune to the effects of stress on their nighttime slumber, Krieger said. However, for people who have trouble drifting off or for those with sleep fragmentation — brief but frequent awakenings during the night — ongoing stress from the news can turn the occasional bad night of sleep into a real problem. Age is also a risk factor — older adults may already have issues with sleep due to existing health conditions, medications and chronic pain, and so may be especially sensitive to additional stress. Women also have higher rates of insomnia than men, as do people with family members who have insomnia, Drerup said. “There’s a genetic predisposition, but there’s also a behavioral impact,” she added. “If I am in an environment where my parents are up late, that will potentially impact my sleep schedule. Family history of mental health issues, specifically anxiety, is another predisposing factor.” Related article
      Your boozy nightcap is disrupting your sleep. Try these tips instead Having an occasional bout of insomnia is common, said sleep specialist Jennifer Mundt, an associate clinical professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who sees patients at the school’s Sleep Wake Center. “Insomnia is a normal reaction to change in stress, even a good change,” Mundt said. “You might get married, get a new job, have a baby, but they still create stress and that can still disrupt your sleep. So it’s quite normal to have a temporary bout of insomnia, and then typically, sleep will go back to baseline.” However, some people develop unhelpful habits and ways of thinking about sleep that create a vicious cycle, said Krieger, who is also director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. “Eventually, many people develop what are called perpetuating factors, or ways they try to cope, which often are not healthy or good for sleep and which can cause chronic insomnia,” she said. “We have patients who can’t sleep and start watching the news or read it on their phones. They turn on the lights, they eat. We even have some who play tennis or exercise in the middle of the night.” Related article
      Regular exercise is associated with less insomnia, study shows While experts encourage getting out of bed after 30 minutes of tossing and turning, it’s not wise to expose your eyes to the blue light of electronic devices during the middle of the night. Doing so just sends a message to the brain that turns off melatonin, the hormone that triggers sleepiness, Krieger said. Eating during the night can lead to heartburn, indigestion and acid reflux, which can disrupt sleep. Exercising in the middle of the night raises body temperature, heart rate and stress hormones, which can derail attempts to doze off. One of the worst behaviors a person with occasional insomnia can do is fret about it, said Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. “However, I can sympathize with that behavior. I don’t know about you, but if I’m awake in the middle of the night, I think about how the world’s horrible, everything is bad, nobody likes me and I’m never going to go back to sleep again,” said Klerman, who is also a sleep researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and sleep physician at Brigham and Young Women’s Hospital in Boston. “We owe it to people who are awake in the middle of the night to study what is happening, and provide more support for them,” she said. There are tried and true techniques that can help you get your sleep back on track, experts say. First, stop doomscrolling. “I talk to a lot of my patients about setting a news curfew,” Mundt said. “Checking news and social media right up until bedtime won’t work. You need a buffer of an hour or so between keeping track of what’s going on and giving yourself time to unwind so you can sleep.” Avoid substances such as alcohol and drugs to wind down at the end of the day, as those can backfire, she said. Related article
      What to do on the nights you are struggling with insomnia, according to experts “Those can just make your sleep worse,” Mundt said. “Avoid having too much caffeine during the day to try to compensate for not sleeping well — that can become a vicious cycle where you don’t sleep well, and then you have more caffeine, and then you don’t sleep well.” And remember, if you’re always thinking about how to get sleep, the harder it becomes to fall asleep, Mundt said. “When people start having insomnia, they can fixate on that, which then becomes a big source of anxiety,” she said. “It can become this really vicious cycle where the anxiety about sleep is the main thing feeding the sleep problem. “Remember, the perpetuating factors are really your behaviors and cognitions,” she said. “Those have the potential to keep the insomnia going even when the stress resolves. It’s these vicious cycles that we want to look out for.” For those who need professional help, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, aptly named CBT-I, is widely considered the gold standard treatment, Mundt said. One key focus is on improving sleep schedules. Related article
      What’s ‘sleepmaxxing’? Experts weigh in on the social media trend “We have them track their sleep pattern with a log and then customize their sleep schedule to really regulate their sleep biology so that it gets more consolidated and more consistent,” she said. Another focus of CBT-I is to retrain the brain to see the bed as a welcoming, calming place. “With insomnia, people spend a lot of time awake in bed. They’re frustrated and anxious, and that all becomes associated with the bed, turning it into this really negative place,” Mundt said. “This is where we talk about only going to bed if you’re sleepy and not using your bed for things other than sleep, and actually getting out of bed if you’re not sleeping for a while,” she said. “We’re trying to recondition and change those negative associations.” Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.",,0.1639823168516159

Babies’ and children’s mattresses and bedding emit toxic chemicals and flame retardants associated with developmental and hormonal disorders, according to two new studies. “We measured chemicals in the air of 25 children’s bedrooms between the ages of 6 months and 4 years and found worrisome levels of more than two dozen phthalates, flame retardants and UV filters,” said senior study author Miriam Diamond, a professor in the Earth Sciences Department at the University of Toronto. Related article
      Black-colored plastic used for kitchen utensils and toys linked to banned toxic flame retardants The highest levels of the chemicals were found near the children’s beds, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. To check why, a companion study by Diamond’s team tested 16 new children’s mattresses and found those to be a key source of the exposure. Then, using a simulation, the team found that the warmth and weight of the sleeping child could increase the off-gassing of the toxicants. “They found that even something as simple as a child’s body heat and weight on a mattress can increase the release of toxic chemicals into the air they breathe while sleeping – a factor that current safety standards don’t consider,” said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors dedicated to reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. She was not involved in the new research. The study did not include brand names, but the researchers told CNN that they were well-known, lower-cost mattresses found at leading retail stores. Tested mattresses were purchased in Canada, but they contained materials from the United States and Mexico. Therefore, the results are likely to apply to mattresses purchased throughout North America, Diamond said. “The results show that parents can’t shop their way out of the problem,” Houlihan said in an email. “The mattresses tested emitted toxic chemicals regardless of their price, materials, or country of origin. And some contained additives above legal limits.” The American Chemistry Council, which represents the US chemical, plastic and chlorine industry, told CNN via email that its members take safety seriously. “The use of flame retardant chemistries can be critical in situations where an accidental spark or short-circuited wire turns into a flame,” said Tom Flanagin, the group’s senior director of product communications. “While we will need time to review the study in detail, the mere presence of a chemistry is not an indication of risk or adverse effect. Today, any chemistry introduced or imported into the U.S. must undergo rigorous review and approval processes by federal agencies, such as EPA and FDA.” Phthalates – found in hundreds of consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children’s toys – are known to interfere with the body’s mechanism for hormone production, known as the endocrine system. In addition, they are linked with early puberty, reproductive issues and genital defects, hormone issues and other problems, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. “Our study we found high levels of phthalates that are restricted in toys but not in mattresses,” Diamond said.

      Which foods have the most plastics? You may be surprised Even small hormonal disruptions can cause “significant developmental and biological effects,” the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences states on its website. Children are especially vulnerable to the disruptive impact of chemicals due to their rapidly developing brains and bodies. Research has connected phthalates with reproductive problems, such as genital malformations and undescended testes in baby boys and lower sperm counts and testosterone levels in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to childhood obesity, asthma, cardiovascular issues, premature deaths and cancer. One well-studied type of flame retardant called polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs, is the “greatest contributor to intellectual disability” in children, resulting in a total loss of “162 million IQ points and over 738,000 cases of intellectual disability” between 2001 and 2016, according to a January 2020 study. Some of the PBDE flame retardants were banned by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2012, but replacements have been introduced. One of those, called organophosphate ester, or OPFRs, was measured in the new research. These chemicals have also been linked to reproductive, developmental and nervous system disruption in toddlers.

      Bacterial slime on microplastics helps breed antibiotic-resistant superbugs, study says “OPFRs are now being used in large volumes, are sufficiently persistent to be detected globally, present health hazards, and may cause harm to humans, especially children, at current exposure levels,” Diamond and her colleagues wrote in an October 2019 study. One mattress had 1,700 parts per million of an organophosphate ester called TDCPP, a known carcinogen according to the National Library of Medicine Pub Chem website. Another had 1,600 parts per million, Diamond said. One mattress had a certified label stating that the materials complied with current regulations, Diamond said. Yet the study found that it contained 1,800 parts per million of pentachlorothiophenol, or PCTP, one of five flame retardants banned by the EPA. Related article
      Flame retardants found in thousands of consumer products linked to cancer in people for first time One flame retardant is illegal in Canada but was found in a mattress and has been banned in children’s sleepwear in the US. In some states, such as California with its passage of Prop 65, regulators have put additional limitations in place on products marketed for children, but no national law covering classes of flame retardants exists, despite a 2017 report by the US Consumer Products Safety Commission on the dangers of organophosphate esters. “It’s concerning that these chemicals are still being found in children’s mattresses even though we know they have no proven fire-safety benefit and aren’t needed to comply with flammability standards.” said study co-author Arlene Blum, executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute, a group of scientists and policy experts who work and report on chemicals of concern. “Parents should be able to lay their children down for sleep knowing they are safe and snug,” Blum said in a statement. Potentially toxic chemicals are so widespread in children’s products that it can be very hard for parents to choose safer options, said Jane Muncke, managing director and chief scientific officer at the Food Packaging Forum, a nonprofit foundation based in Zurich, Switzerland, that focuses on science communication and research. She was not involved in the new research. “As a mother of children, I remember the stress when choosing the right products for them, not just mattresses,” Muncke said in an email. “We opted for large brands that I knew had at least some chemicals policies, and tried to get natural materials — latex, cotton, merino — or buy second hand, because I figured that most chemicals that would gas out will already have gassed out.” Related article

So unfortunately, I would definitely go for duller, neutral colors.” Wash bedding and clothing worn to sleep often, since they act as a protective barrier, absorbing some of these contaminants to help reduce exposure to baby’s skin, Diamond said.

"At a swim meet just outside St. Louis, heads turned when a team of young swimmers walked through the rec center with their parents in tow. A supportive mom kept her eye on the clock while the Makos Swim Team athletes tucked their natural curls, braids and locs into yellow swimming caps. In the bleachers, spectators whispered about the team’s presence at the pool in Centralia, Illinois — as they do at almost every competition. “They don’t know that we’re listening,” Randella Randell, a swimmer’s mom, said later. “But we’re here to stay. We’re here to represent. We’re going to show you that Black kids know how to swim. We swim, too.” Related article
      ‘I feel dismissed’: People experiencing colorism say health system fails them Randell’s son, Elijah Gilliam, 14, is a member of the Makos’ competitive YMCA and USA Swimming program based in north St. Louis. Almost 40 athletes, ages 4 to 19, swim on the squad, which encourages Black and multiracial kids to participate in the sport. Coached by Terea Goodwin and Torrie Preciado, the team also spreads the word about water safety in their community. “If we can get everybody to learn how to swim, just that little bit, it would save so many lives,” said Goodwin, a kitchen and bathroom designer by day who is known as Coach T at the pool. “Swimming is life.” But just like mako sharks, such teams of Black swimmers are rare. Detroit has the Razor Aquatics, Howard University in Washington, DC, has a team that’s made headlines for winning championships, and some alums from North Carolina A&T’s former swim team created a group to offer water safety classes. In the past, Black Americans were barred from many public swimming pools. When racial segregation was officially banned, White Americans established private swim clubs that required members to pay a fee that wasn’t always affordable. As a result, swimming remained effectively segregated, and many Black Americans stayed away from pools. The impact is still felt. More than a third of Black adults report they do not know how to swim, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics, more than twice the rate for adults overall. Seeing a need in their community, the parents of the Makos swimmers formed the Black Swimmers Alliance at the end of 2023 with a goal of “bridging the gap in aquatic skills,” according to its website. But the group, which offers swim lessons to families of color, is concerned about the flow of grant money dwindling because of the recent federal backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Even so, it is fundraising directly on its own, because lives are being lost. In late January, a 6-year-old died at a hotel pool in St. Louis. A boy the same age drowned while taking swim lessons at a St. Louis County pool in 2022. And across the river in Hamel, Illinois, a 3-year-old boy drowned in a backyard pool last summer.

      With few dentists and fluoride under siege, rural America risks new surge of tooth decay Drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages 1 through 4, according to the CDC. Black children and Black adults drown far more often than their White peers. Members of the Black Swimmers Alliance discussed those statistics before their advocacy work began. They also had to address another issue — many of the adult volunteers and parents with children on the Makos team didn’t know how to swim. Even though their children were swimming competitively, the fear of drowning and the repercussions of history had kept the parents out of the pool. The Makos athletes also noticed that their parents were timid around water. That’s when their roles reversed. The children started to look out for the grown-ups. Joseph Johnson, now 14, called out his mom, Connie Johnson, when she tried to give him a few tips about how to improve his performance. “He was like, ‘Mom, you have no idea,’” the now-55-year-old recalled. “At first, I was offended, but he was absolutely right. I didn’t know how to swim.” She signed up for lessons with Coach T. Najma Nasiruddin-Crump and her husband, Joshua Crump, signed up, too. His daughter Kaia Collins-Crump, now 14, had told them she wanted to join the Makos team the first time she saw it. But among the three of them, no one knew how to swim. Joshua Crump, 38, said he initially felt silly at the lessons, then started to get the hang of it. “I don’t swim well enough to beat any of the children in a race,” Crump said with a chuckle. Nasiruddin-Crump said she was terrified the first time she jumped into the deep end. “It is the only moment in my life outside of birthing my children that I’ve been afraid of something,” the 33-year-old said. “But once you do it, it’s freedom. It’s pure freedom.” Mahoganny Richardson, whose daughter Ava is on the team, volunteered to teach more Makos parents how to swim. She said the work starts outside the pool with a conversation about a person’s experiences with water. She has heard stories about adults who were pushed into pools, then told to sink or swim. Black women were often told to stay out of the water to maintain hairstyles that would swell if their hair got wet. Bradlin Jacob-Simms, 47, decided to learn how to swim almost 20 years after her family survived Hurricane Katrina. She evacuated the day before the storm hit but said one of her friends survived only because that woman’s brother was able to swim to find help. “If it wasn’t for him, they would have died,” Jacob-Simms said, noting that hundreds did drown. “That’s the reason why swimming is important to me. A lot of times, us as African Americans, we shy away from it. It’s not really in our schools. It’s not really pushed.” Makos swimmer Rocket McDonald, 13, encouraged his mom, Jamie McDonald, to get back into the water and stick with it. When she was a child, her parents had signed her up for swim lessons, but she never got the hang of it. Her dad was always leery of the water. McDonald didn’t understand why until she read about a race riot at a pool not far from where her dad grew up that happened after St. Louis desegregated public pools in 1949. “It was a full-circle moment,” McDonald said. “It all makes sense now.” Now, at 42, McDonald is learning to swim again. Safety is always a priority for the Makos team. Coach T makes the athletes practice swimming in full clothing as a survival skill. Years ago, as a lifeguard in Kansas City, Missouri, Coach T pulled dozens of children out of recreational swimming pools who were drowning. Most of them, she said, were Black children who came to cool off but didn’t know how to swim. “I was literally jumping in daily, probably hourly, getting kids out of every section,” Goodwin said. After repeated rescues, too many to count, she decided to offer lessons. Related article
      The color of your child’s swimsuit can play a role in their safety at the pool, experts say Swim lessons can be costly. The Black Swimmers Alliance aimed to fund 1,000 free swim lessons by the end of 2025. It had already funded 150 lessons in St. Louis. But when the group looked for grants, the alliance scaled back its goal to 500 lessons, out of caution about what funding would be available. It’s still committed to helping Black athletes swim competitively throughout their school years and in college. Most of the time, the Makos swimmers practice in a YMCA pool that doesn’t have starting blocks. Backstroke flags are held in place with fishing wire, and the assistant coach’s husband, José Preciado, used his 3D printer to make red, regulation 15-meter markers for the team. Once a week, parents drive the team to a different YMCA pool that has starting blocks. That pool is about 5 degrees warmer for its senior patrons’ comfort. Sometimes the young swimmers fuss about the heat, but practicing there helps them prepare for meets. Parents said White officials have frequently disqualified Makos swimmers. So some of the team parents studied the rules of the sport, and eventually four became officials to diversify the ranks and ensure all swimmers are treated fairly. Still, parents said, that hasn’t stopped occasional racist comments from bystanders and other swimmers at meets. “Some didn’t think we’d make it this far, not because of who we are, but where we’re from,” Goodwin has taught the Makos swimmers to recite. “So we have to show them.” And this spring, Richardson is offering lessons for Makos parents while their children practice. “It’s not just about swimming,” Richardson said. “It’s about overcoming something that once felt impossible.” KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

"Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. I’m captivated by my new personal health tracker, a Christmas gift from my husband. It’s fascinating to know my heart rate, respiration, activity, readiness and stress levels at any moment. Yet it’s the sleep data that has me mesmerized — and a bit worried. Why does it say I only slept five hours when I was in bed for more than six? Wait, what? I was in light sleep for most of the night and got only 30 minutes of deep and dream sleep? That can’t be good. Related article
      Sexsomnia: An embarrassing sleep disorder no one wants to talk about I spent days trying to understand what the charts and graphs were telling me about my slumber, then finally came to my senses. As a journalist who writes about sleep (a lot), I know it’s the overall quality that matters, not whether I had any dreams or got enough deep sleep last night. After all, everyone has to stay up late at times due to a sick child, travel or an unfinished work project. For some people, however, the fascination with their sleep tracker doesn’t wane — it becomes a stubborn obsession. In fact, enough people fret over their sleep data trying to get a perfect night’s sleep that sleep specialists have coined a term for the behavior: orthosomnia. Orthosomnia is derived from the Latin word ortho, which means being right or correct, and somnia, the Latin word for sleep, said the term’s inventor, clinical psychologist Kelly Baron, a professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who specializes in behavioral sleep medicine. Baron and her colleagues published the first case studies on orthosomnia in 2017 after seeing a number of patients who would insist their sleep trackers were correct despite being told otherwise. While the behavior is not considered a medical disorder, it’s disturbing nonetheless, Baron said. Related article
      What happens if you wake up before your alarm? Tips from sleep experts “I’ve seen some real horror stories,” she said. “One 27-year-old woman said her tracker showed she wasn’t sleeping. An overnight lab study showed that she was, but she would still not believe her tracker was wrong.” That behavior was bewildering, Baron said, because early models of sleep trackers were notoriously inaccurate. “A lot of sleep time was considered awake, and the reported sleep cycles were completely off,” she said. “Yet we’d see people develop insomnia worrying over the lack of sleep on their tracker. Some would even take tremendous amounts of sleep medication, which is just scary.” One woman Baron treated talked her general practitioner into prescribing large doses of an antipsychotic based on erroneous sleep data from her device. “Her tracker was off-label — I had never heard of it — and was so inaccurate that the graphs weren’t even labeled,” Baron said. “Good quality trackers today often use multisensor inputs such as movement, heart rate variability and the like, so they’ve come a long way in accuracy. “But until trackers actually measure brain waves like we do in a sleep lab, it’s just an estimate,” she said. “I believe being obsessed with sleep trackers contributes to a lot of sleep anxiety and insomnia.” You don’t need a sleep tracker to sleep well, experts stress. Just follow good sleep hygiene recommendations, such as going to sleep and getting up at the same time each day. Be sure to address any sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, which can harm your health. OK, you already have a tracker (or want one). Use it to see how various life choices affect your sleep, experts say. Does eating too late mean you have more awakenings? How about that nightcap? Alcohol is known to disrupt sleep in the middle of the night. Beyond that, you can keep your relationship with your tracker healthy by asking yourself the following questions, suggested sleep specialist Jennifer Mundt, an associate professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who sees patients at the school’s Sleep Wake Center. Related article
      Sleep this way to add almost 5 years to your life “How do you feel when you review your sleep data? Does it lead to any tangible steps that have improved your sleep?” Mundt said in an email. “Is it telling you anything new or just reminding you that you didn’t sleep well — and making you feel more anxious about it?” The paradox of good sleep, she added, is that the harder we strive for it, the harder it is to obtain. “If you feel frustrated or anxious, it’s a good idea to try taking a break from the sleep tracker,” Mundt said, “because feeling anxious about sleep is not conducive to helping you sleep better.” By educating yourself on the various stages of sleep, you can reduce anxiety about your tracker’s results, experts say. Sleep latency: Also known as stage one sleep, this is how long it takes you to fully fall asleep. Contrary to popular belief, it’s not healthy to drop off to sleep immediately — that’s a sign of extreme sleep deprivation. Taking 20 to 30 minutes to drift off after lights out is just fine.

      He was the first person to be diagnosed with a new sleep disorder. It led to a scientific breakthrough Light sleep: When I first opened my sleep tracker, I was shocked by how much of my night was spent in light, or stage two sleep. Yet that is also perfectly normal, experts say. Our brain uses light sleep to transition between slow-wave sleep, or deep sleep, and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep, which is the stage in which we dream. Experts say about 50% of your night should be in light sleep. Deep and REM sleep: During deep sleep, the brain sweeps out toxins and dead cells while also repairing and restoring the body for the next day. While we dream during REM sleep, the brain is busy processing emotions, consolidating memories and absorbing new information. It makes sense that getting quality deep and REM sleep is key to our ability to function. Right now, experts believe that most adults should spend between 20% and 25% of their night in deep sleep as well as REM sleep. Older adults require less, while babies need much more — in fact, infants can spend about 50% of their sleep in REM, experts say. Using that measurement, an adult who sleeps the recommended eight hours a night would require about 1.6 to two hours of sleep in REM sleep and the same amount in deep sleep. However, everyone is different, and it’s unwise to fixate on specific numbers, said sleep researcher Dr. Ana Krieger, a professor of clinical medicine in the departments of medicine, neurology and genetic medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.

      Marijuana may make sleep worse, especially for regular users, study finds Why? Because researchers are still using rudimentary tools to understand a brain system that is truly controlled by chemicals, said Krieger, who is director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. “Today, we measure electrical activity and brain waves, when what we need is more science to understand the true neurochemical underpinnings of sleep,” she said. “I often tell patients, it’s like this beautiful full orchestra that plays at night, with many different chemicals, or instruments if you will, that enter and recede at different times.” Science does not yet know enough to understand fully all the stages of sleep, Krieger added, but research is underway. Stay tuned. “In the meantime, I suggest people stop worrying about the breakdown of their sleep,” she said. “Instead, focus on relaxing and working on your environment to sleep without interference or interruption at night.”",,0.20494641363620758

Sunday is 420 day, when lovers of marijuana get together to celebrate their fondness for weed. Yet research shows that regular users of marijuana are at risk for serious conditions, including strokes, heart attacks, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle. Now, an increased risk of dementia can be added to the list, according to a large study of more than 6 million people published April 14 in the journal JAMA Neurology. Related article
      More frequent marijuana use may damage an important memory skill “Someone who has an emergency room visit or hospitalization due to cannabis has a 23% increased risk of dementia within five years compared to someone who was at the hospital for another reason. They have a 72% greater risk compared to the general population,” said study coauthor Dr. Daniel Myran, an assistant professor in the department of family medicine at the University of Ottawa in Canada. “Those numbers have already factored out other reasons for dementia, such as age, sex, mental health or substance use, and whether or not you have chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease,” Myran said. Earlier research shows marijuana users are nearly 25% more likely to need emergency care and hospitalization than nonusers. “However, this is not a study that anyone should look at and say, ‘Jury’s in, and cannabis use causes dementia,’” Myran said. “This is a study that brings up a concerning association that fits within a growing body of research.” A red flag The study is a red flag for health professionals who should be screening for cannabis use disorder, said Dr. Robert Page II, a professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora. “People with cannabis use disorder are unable to stop using even though they encounter health or social problems from use,” said Page, who chaired the medical writing group for the American Heart Association’s 2020 scientific statement on marijuana. “When they stop using it, they either have withdrawal symptoms or have very bad mental health symptoms,” he added. “They might have quite severe depression, or they might have anxiety, all of which can send them to the hospital.” Related article

If you have underlying psychiatric issues, realize that you need to be transparent with your provider and let them know if you’re using this medically or recreationally.” Rates of hospital screening are rising Researchers looked at medical records between 2008 and 2021 for more than 6 million people between the ages of 45 and 105 without dementia who lived in Ontario. Of those, over 16,000 had been seen due to negative responses to marijuana. “Within five years of an emergency room visit or hospitalization for cannabis, 5% of people were diagnosed with dementia, and within 10 years, 19% of people were diagnosed with dementia,” Myran said. Rates of emergency room visits due to marijuana increased fivefold in adults between the ages of 45 and 64 and nearly 27-fold for people 65 and older during those 13 years, according to the study.

      Why replacing alcohol with weed is a growing trend in the US “While this study was done in Canada, it should apply to all of North America including the US,” he added, pointing to a May 2024 study that shows daily or near daily use of marijuana surpassed alcohol by 2022. If the connection between cannabis use and dementia does turn out to be causal, just how might marijuana trigger cognitive decline in regular users? One possibility is that daily or near daily use of marijuana changes neural connectivity in the brain, Myran said. “There’s certainly a pathway where there’s potential inflammation and microvascular damage from marijuana,” he said. “It could be that regular cannabis use causes people to develop other risk factors for dementia, such as depression, social isolation and lower educational attainment. And it could be that people who regularly use cannabis are more likely to have major trauma to the brain such as a motor vehicle collision.”",,0.22642771899700165
"Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. Want to improve your chances for a good night’s sleep? This idea could actually knock your socks on, says behavioral sleep disorders specialist Michelle Drerup. “It sounds counterintuitive, I know, but by wearing socks to bed and warming your feet, you may actually lower your core body temperature and fall asleep faster,” said Drerup, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Cleveland Clinic. Related article
      The potential dangers of sleep trackers, according to experts Here’s how that happens. During the day, a typical adult’s core temperature rises to between 97 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 C and 37.2 C), with an average of 98.6 F (37 C) — children 10 and younger may run a bit cooler. As night approaches, core temperature begins to drop by one to two degrees, preparing the body for sleep. A process called distal vasodilation helps with cooling  by widening blood vessels in the extremities — primarily the hands and feet — thus increasing heat loss though the skin. As the skin warms, the core of the body cools, which is where those toasty socks come in handy. “By making your feet warmer, you’re opening up blood vessels to help cool down the rest of the body,” Drerup said. “So increasing the blood circulation to your feet results in a lower core temperature.” In fact, a small study published in 2018 found young men who slept in socks fell asleep nearly eight minutes faster and slept 32 minutes longer than those who didn’t, with fewer awakenings during the night. It’s not just socks. Sleep experts suggest keeping the entire bedroom about 65 F (18.3 C) to keep your core temperature cool during the night. Of course, that can fluctuate, with some requiring a room closer to 60 F (15.6 C) and others preferring a warmer 70 F (21.1 C). Another tip is to take a warm (not hot) shower or bath before bed. The principle is the same, Drerup said. “If I’m slightly increasing my core body temperature a bit just before bedtime, then there’s a bigger drop as it lowers, and that potentially helps with feeling sleepy,” she said.

In my home, I’m addicted to fuzzy socks and wear them religiously to bed — if my tootsies are the slightest bit chilly, sleep is impossible. My husband, on the other hand, immediately kicks the covers off his feet, preferring what I view as popsicle toes. To each their own, says sleep specialist Jennifer Mundt, an associate professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who sees patients at the school’s Sleep Wake Center. “If you wear socks to bed and you feel like your feet are too hot, by all means, take your socks off,” Mundt said. “It’s the same idea with room temperature. People can get really hung up — ‘Oh, I heard from this podcast or this book that the bedroom should be this exact temperature.’ “That’s just not really the way it works,” she added. “Just use your own judgment of just what feels comfortable, because our bodies are good at telling us if we’re too warm or we’re too cold.”",,0.2033233791589737
"Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. Do you find yourself reaching for an alcoholic drink to unwind and drift off to sleep? Whether it’s an old-fashioned, a hot toddy or even an espresso martini, many people have a favorite evening beverage that signals the end of a long day. But what’s the history behind this nightly ritual? The tradition of enjoying a drink to promote better sleep — known as a nightcap — dates to the early 18th century. The term “nightcap” originally referred to a literal hat worn at night before modern heating, designed to keep the head warm for more restful sleep. Over time, people began associating this warming sensation with the effects of an evening alcoholic drink, an idea that persists in popular culture today. However, as health officials continue to issue warnings about the dangers of alcohol, it might be time to ditch the nightly habit. In January, then-US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory on the cancer risks associated with alcohol consumption and called for updated health warnings on alcoholic beverages. And the negative impact of alcohol can also extend to your sleep. “Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, which is why it causes drowsiness,” said Dr. Anthony Reffi, a clinical psychologist and assistant scientist at Henry Ford Health’s Sleep Disorders and Research Center in Detroit, via email. “However, it negatively impacts sleep quality, causing night-time awakenings that leave people feeling tired the next day.” Related article
      3 health conditions increase risk of liver damage if you drink, study says The effects of alcohol on sleep vary and are influenced by factors such as sex, body weight, metabolism and the amount of alcohol consumed, Dr. Deirdre Conroy, clinical director of the behavioral sleep medicine program and clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, said via email. While a higher dose of alcohol generally makes it easier to fall asleep, it also increases the likelihood of waking up in the middle of the night, Conroy said. Alcohol works by inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain — the chemicals responsible for firing up functions in the body and keeping it alert — making people feel sleepy more quickly, said Dr. Timothy Roehrs, former director of research at the Sleep Disorders and Research Center of Henry Ford Health System. Drinking alcohol before bed raises blood alcohol content, which disrupts rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep, a critical phase of the sleep cycle responsible for cognitive functions such as memory, concentration and mood regulation. During the first three to four hours of sleep, alcohol is reaching its peak concentration in the body, which explains the initial onset of that sleepy sensation. However, in the second half of the night, people will experience a “rebound effect,” resulting in more frequent awakenings and disturbances as the night progresses and alcohol is metabolized, Reffi said. Moderate and high doses of alcohol also reduce the overall amount of REM sleep an individual gets in a night, Reffi added. Related article
      A drink now may impact you more than it would years ago. Here’s why that’s a problem Research also shows that people with chronic insomnia may find temporary relief from alcohol use before bed, but the effects are short-lived. One study conducted at Henry Ford Health’s Sleep Disorders and Research Center found that participants who drank a high dose of alcohol before bed initially slept longer than those who consumed a low dose or none. However, when assessed a week later, those differences disappeared, and the high-dose drinkers were sleeping less and experiencing fewer minutes in deep sleep, Reffi said. Beyond affecting the quality of your sleep, regular alcohol consumption before bed can have long-term consequences, such as increased tolerance to its sedative effects and a higher risk of alcohol dependence. Additionally, combining alcohol with other medications taken at bedtime could intensify its calmative effects, potentially leading to injuries if you get out of bed during the night, Conroy said. If you’re hoping for more restorative sleep, it may be time to reconsider your evening routine and explore healthier alternatives to a nightly drink. Nonalcoholic beverages have become an increasingly popular choice for those looking to unwind without the negative side effects of alcohol. Many brands now offer options that mimic the same “bite” associated with cocktails while still providing a satisfying drink to help people relax before bed, Reffi said. Alternatively, herbal teas or choices such as a “sleepy girl mocktail” can also provide a calming effect similar to alcohol. However, drinking too much liquid before bed can also lead to disruptions and frequent trips to the restroom in the middle of the night, so it’s best to avoid drinking too much close to bedtime. It’s also important to steer clear of caffeine for at least eight to 10 hours before sleep to avoid interfering with your body’s natural sleep cycles. Related article
      Don’t drink before your nap on the plane. It could hurt you now and later For those who consistently struggle with sleep disruptions, talking to a trained professional can help uncover any underlying issues, Conroy said, but establishing a consistent wind-down routine can help signal to your body that it’s time to rest. She added that incorporating relaxation techniques, avoiding stimulating activities before bed and limiting naps can greatly improve sleep quality as well as exercising regularly. “Try other activities that help promote relaxation before bed: read, meditate, journal, pray or spend time with loved ones,” Reffi said. “Avoid activities that stress you out before bed — turn off the news, get off social media and put your phone on do not disturb.”",,0.30103734135627747
"Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. When Dr. Luc Beaudoin was an undergraduate student nearly 40 years ago, he often had trouble falling asleep on Sunday nights and was eager to find a solution. He found inspiration in a cognitive psychology class he was taking and a professor’s theory regarding visual motion detection, Beaudoin, now a cognitive scientist, said. Visual motion detection refers to the visual system’s ability to perceive and process motion based on changing patterns of light on the retina. “I thought to myself: If I can understand the human brain’s ‘sleep onset control system,’ I could perhaps devise a technique to trick the brain into falling asleep,” Beaudoin, who is also an adjunct professor of education at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said via email. That technique was cemented as “cognitive shuffling” by 2009, when he was 41 and experiencing another bout of difficulty initially falling asleep or falling back asleep after waking up in the middle of the night. Related article
      Counting sheep: Who came up with this old sleep tip, and does it work? “My insomnia went away,” Beaudoin said. “My girlfriend (now my wife) was amazed that I would fall asleep so quickly. I felt I was onto something important. So, I read more extensively and thought deeply about the sleep onset control system.” Cognitive shuffling typically involves mentally conjuring up random, impersonal and non-emotionally charged words. For each letter of a word you pick at random, you think of as many corresponding words as you can for five to eight seconds each before moving to the next letter, Beaudoin said. For the word “piano,” for example, you might think “Pear, parachute, Paul, pirouette … Item, intention, immature, igloo …” and so on. (Beaudoin is also an owner of CogZest and a cofounder of CogSci Apps Corp. and Somnolence+ Inc., all of which develop products based on his research.) While the technique may not sound calming, it “takes your mind off of your problems and your issues, and helps you get into a more relaxed state of mind,” said Dr. Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, a sleep medicine physician and neurologist at the Millennium Physician Group in Fort Myers, Florida. “I always tell patients, ‘You cannot force yourself to sleep. You have to allow yourself to sleep.’ And this is just one of the methods that we use to help with that,” added Abbasi-Feinberg, who often suggests the technique for her patients having sleep issues. Sometimes you can even visualize corresponding scenarios or movements, such as yourself playing the piano or someone falling with a parachute, Beaudoin said. READ MORE: Anxiety robbing your sleep? A weighted blanket may help Here’s the science behind cognitive shuffling, and what to know about practicing it. Why cognitive shuffling works At this point, there’s little research on cognitive shuffling. So what makes some doctors back a do-it-yourself sleep hack without substantial evidence? It turns out that the fundamental theory behind cognitive shuffling, though conjectural, “aligns with established principles in cognitive neuroscience and sleep psychology,” Dr. Leah Kaylor, a clinical psychologist and author based in Louisiana, said via email. It’s based on a large number of studies Beaudoin and other researchers reviewed in a paper published April 2020 in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews. In addition to taking the mind off one’s worries, cognitive shuffling “resembles in critical respects natural sleep onset,” Beaudoin said. Related article
      Adults can sleep with stuffed animals, too. It might even be a good thing, experts say In the natural transition into sleep, people tend to have “microdreams” and fragmented, nonlinear thought patterns, Beaudoin and Kaylor said. Intentionally engaging in random, disconnected thinking may replicate this cognitive presleep state, helping people fall asleep. “We think there’s a positive feedback loop in the brain: Microdreams are not just a product of falling asleep; they cue the brain that it is safe and appropriate to fall asleep,” Beaudoin said. Since our brains tend to “shuffle” between random thoughts during quieter periods, giving our brains a calming or neutral distraction can be more helpful than allowing them to find something on their own, Dr. Kami McManus, a sleep psychologist in the department of sleep medicine at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, said via email. Beaudoin published his third study on cognitive shuffling in 2016. The study’s sample size was small, but its findings were encouraging: 154 college students, most of them female, were randomly assigned to a standard treatment done before bedtime, to practicing a cognitive shuffling exercise more formally known as a serial diverse imagining task (SDIT), or to both. In the SDIT group, an app randomly presented recordings of words one at a time with eight-second intervals in between, during which participants created and maintained an image of the word until the next recording prompted the next image and so on. The SDIT group were more likely to experience improvements in sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep and presleep arousal — heightened physical or mental activity while trying to fall asleep. These benefits lasted throughout the semester. Related article
      What’s ‘sleepmaxxing’? Experts weigh in on the social media trend Beaudoin and his team are planning additional research, this time comparing cognitive shuffling to other mental visualization and cognitive techniques. Imagining yourself to sleep To practice cognitive shuffling, there isn’t a set number of words or amount of time required. The words you choose for each letter also don’t have to be logically related, Kaylor said — trying to control the randomness will reduce the technique’s effectiveness. People typically report falling asleep within around five to 15 minutes, while others may take longer, especially if they’re highly stressed or prone to overthinking, Kaylor said. If you find yourself engaged in the technique for more than 20 minutes or starting to feel frustrated, it’s best to give up and get out of bed, McManus said. Your body may not be ready, so doing a calming activity elsewhere for 20 to 30 minutes before going back to bed and trying again is better than trying too hard and activating negative emotions, making sleep more difficult. Try this technique several nights in a row before you decide whether cognitive shuffling works for you, these experts recommended. However, remember that it’s not a replacement for proper sleep hygiene or a cure for a sleep condition. “If someone drinks a lot of coffee before bed, they shouldn’t expect cognitive techniques to help them fall asleep,” Beaudoin said.

      Socks could really improve your sleep, experts say Additionally, you should still ensure you have regular sleep and wake times; a bedtime routine involving other wind-down habits such as journaling or taking a warm shower; a quiet, dark and cool room; limited screen time before bed; and no alcohol in the few hours before sleep. If you regularly have problems sleeping, Beaudoin emphasized that cognitive techniques in general aren’t replacements for medical advice. They’re also not substitutes for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, known as CBT-I, as many cases of insomnia have more than one element in need of treatment.",,0.23082418739795685
"Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. Max Genecov is a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, a dad, and a stuffed animal owner. “I’ve always had them growing up, I had a big fantasy life with them (as a child),” he said. “I just think that they’re nice things you have.” He has a plush racoon from his childhood, crochets them when friends or family have babies, and still sometimes hugs a stuffed animal or uses one as a pillow when he sleeps, he said. It might sound unusual, but when you think about it –– is it really? Plush sales grew over the Covid-19 pandemic, and in 2024, 21% of plush toys were sold to adults over 18, according to Juli Lennett, US toys industry adviser at Circana, a market research and technology company in Chicago. Stuffed animals “struck a chord with young adults and adults as a means to entertain, collect, and provide comfort during the pandemic,” she said in an email. Build-A-Bear even has an entire section of its website dedicated to products for grown-ups. A survey the company commissioned found that more than half of people held on to a childhood stuffed animal, and about 40% said they sleep with a plush toy. “I wonder if people are seeking more comfort in the face of uncertainty,” said Dr. Jade Wu, a sleep psychologist and founder of Thrive Sleep Clinic in Durham, North Carolina. And for people living on their own, it could be nice to have something to cuddle with at night, she added. There is nothing wrong with having a stuffed animal as an adult or using one to sleep better, experts said. In fact, there are a lot of positives to it. Stuffed animals are for anyone As a mental health therapist in Seattle, Dr. Jessica Lamar uses stuffed animals with adults who are working through trauma, she said. They go to Build-A-Bear and make a bear to represent their inner child or a younger version of themselves so they can  heal trauma from childhood, she said. Patients giving the bears the comfort, connection and compassion they might not have gotten enough of as a child can be very helpful, Lamar added. But stuffed animals aren’t just for people working through trauma. Anyone can benefit from the gentleness, softness and self-soothing that a cute, plush object can bring, Genecov said. Lamar agreed, noting that a stuffed animal you’ve had since childhood can provide nostalgia, a connection to family or friends you are far from, and a touchpoint for pleasant memories. “It can be very cozy, relaxing and nice,” Wu said. “There’s no reason why adults can’t have the benefits of  that kids get.” Related article
      Socks could really improve your sleep, experts say It’s not immature to cuddle with a stuffie But that is the problem –– stuffed animals are for kids, you might be thinking. “If we think about it from the lens of being like a healthy, balanced adult, I actually think it’s really helpful to say, ‘Hey, I am this adult who’s in college, and I still have this healthy attachment to my childhood,’” Lamar said. “It’s really wonderful to be able to say, ‘This is a part of my child self that I want to stay connected to.’” Maybe there would be an issue if someone became severely distressed or unable to sleep when they were separated from their stuffed animal, Lamar said. It could also be a problem if people used their stuffed animals to avoid other issues, said Dr. Barbara Greenberg, a clinical psychologist in Weston, Connecticut. But both said they haven’t seen that become an issue. In fact, using a stuffed animal to feel better could be good modeling to the kids in your life, Greenberg said. “This is one of the ways to self soothe. We take something like an animal into our bed; it’s comforting,’” she said. “That’s one of the things you have to teach kids when they’re young, how to self-regulate, how to self soothe.” Especially important is to let boys keep their stuffed animals –– they need self-soothing too, Greenberg said. A sleep buddy A stuffed animal in your bed at night might be meeting evolutionary needs, Wu said. “We evolved to live in tribes and to have a village,” she said. “We sleep the best when we feel safe, so when we’re feeling vulnerable … then we want that bodily contact. “Social sleeping makes us  feel more safe and sleep better. So, a stuffed animal may be sort of a good alternative to having someone else sleeping in your bed.” Related article
      Your boozy nightcap is disrupting your sleep. Try these tips instead Even over the course of a life, it makes sense to need contact when you sleep, Lamar added. The womb is a very safe space; then as babies, humans are swaddled to sleep, she said. “As we get older, that obviously becomes less of a need, but that need is still there,” Lamar said. Some stuffed animals are even weighted to provide a little extra pressure when you snuggle up. “There is some research showing that weighted blankets, at least, can help to calm the mind and body,” Wu said.  “I could definitely see a weight of stuffed animals serving a similar function as a weighted blanket in that way.” If nothing else, stuffed animals can help with better sleep by providing a signal to the brain that it is time to wind down, Wu added. “The feeling of it, the smell of it, the sight of it, can be associated with sleep, and so helps to signal that you know sleep is coming,” she said. However you use your favorite stuffed animal –– displayed on a shelf, tucked in a closet or ready for you in bed at night –– it is great if it can be a way to get better sleep, Greenberg said. “If it helps you with stress, it’s a much better alternative than taking a tranquilizer or drinking a glass of wine. It hurts nobody,” she said.

"Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. Need another reason to prioritize your sleep? Not spending enough time in the two deep stages of sleep — slow-wave and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep — may hasten the deterioration of parts of the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease, a new study found. Deficits in slow-wave and REM sleep appear to shrink parts of the brain known to be early indicators of cognitive deterioration and Alzheimer’s disease, said lead study author Gawon Cho, a postdoctoral associate in internal medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “We found the volume of a part of the brain called the inferior parietal region   shrunk in people with inadequate slow and REM sleep,” Cho said. “That part of the brain synthesizes sensory information, including visuospatial information, so it makes sense that it shows neurodegeneration early in the disease.” Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Issacson, who established one of the first Alzheimer’s prevention clinics in the United States, said in an email that his clinical experience treating adults at risk for Alzheimer’s supports the study’s findings. “We also found sleep metrics on deeper sleep predicted cognitive function, so between that plus brain volumes, it’s real,” said Issacson, who is director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study. What happens in the brain during deep sleep During deep sleep, the brain sweeps out toxins and dead cells while also repairing and restoring the body for the next day. While we dream during REM sleep, the brain is busy processing emotions, consolidating memories and absorbing new information. It makes sense that getting quality deep and REM sleep is key to our ability to function. Adults need about seven to eight hours of sleep to be healthy, while teens and younger children need much more. However, data shows that more than 1 in 3 American adults  don’t get enough sleep, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts say most adults should spend between 20% and 25% of their night in deep sleep, and the same goes for REM sleep. Older adults require less, while babies need much more — in fact, infants can spend about 50% of their sleep in REM. To make matters worse, deeper stages of sleep decrease as you age, Cho said. Related article
      The potential dangers of sleep trackers, according to experts Can you get more deep sleep? Deep sleep tends to come soon after we fall asleep, while REM sleep appears later in the night, toward morning. Therefore, if you go to bed late and get up early, you are cutting your chances of spending enough time in one or both stages. “The more time you are in bed, the more a person sleeps, and generally speaking, the longer a person sleeps, the more REM and deep sleep they will get,” Isaacson said. However, you have to do more than just lie in bed longer — you also need have to have an uninterrupted, restful sleep on a regular basis, experts say. If you do that, there’s an additional payoff — a February 2023 study found good sleep habits added nearly five years to a man’s life expectancy and almost 2.5 years to a woman’s life. To accomplish this, however, you can’t wake up during the night or have trouble falling asleep more than two times a week, the study found. You also have to feel well rested at least five days a week when you wake up. And finally, you can’t be using sleep medications to achieve your good slumber. Related article
      Socks could really improve your sleep, experts say But don’t lose hope. The good news is that you can easily train your brain to better sleep by following what is called “sleep hygiene.” It’s important to go to bed at the same time on most nights and get up at the same time most mornings — even on weekends and holidays. Make sure your sleeping environment is optimal — cooler and darker is better — and block noise or try a sound machine. Avoid booze before bed — it may seem like you’re falling asleep more easily, but when your liver finishes metabolizing the alcohol at 3 a.m., your body will wake up, experts say. Set up a sleep routine, with no blue lights or distractions at least an hour before bedtime. Try meditation, yoga, tai chi, warm baths — anything that relaxes you is great. “How do you make your sleep better? I think people really have to do their part to improve their own sleep,” Cho said. “There’s no one medicine that improves overall sleep.” Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.",,0.2881329357624054
"Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life. More than a decade after the Obama-era move to generally prohibit whole and 2% milk in schools as part of an effort to lower rates of obesity among children, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and some lawmakers are arguing for the beverage’s return. Kennedy, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, recently called the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans “antiquated” and said he’s pushing Head Start programs to switch from low-fat dairy to full-fat dairy, including whole milk. The US Senate has also taken up the cause, with the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry holding a hearing Tuesday on the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act. The measure would allow higher-fat milks in school meal programs, in addition to fat-free (skim) and low-fat milk already required to be available for children over age 2. There’s a corresponding bill in the US House of Representatives. Both bills were introduced by Republican lawmakers in January but have bipartisan support. Related article
      Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says beef tallow is healthier than seed oils. Is he right? “I think about whole milk growing up, where my grandparents delivered milk to us two or three times a week, and it was just part of our diet … and how important whole milk is,” Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, who introduced the Senate bill, said in the hearing. “The Make America Healthy Again movement, it’s about whole foods. And I think we could characterize whole milk as part of that MAHA movement, as well.” The National Milk Producers Federation said it looks forward to working with lawmakers to get the legislation passed, saying it could increase student milk consumption, according to a news release. Here’s what experts say about higher-fat milks and children’s health. The federal role in your child’s lunch The federal government plays a key role in what kids across the country are served for breakfast and lunch at school, and it can change based on shifts in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Every five years, HHS and the US Department of Agriculture update the guidelines, which have recommended low- or fat-free dairy for those older than 2 for more than 40 years. The National School Lunch Program, which provides low-cost or free meals for students, is required to meet those guidelines in its regulations. In an effort to reduce obesity and other health conditions among children, Congress passed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010. It required schools to serve meals with less fat, sugar and sodium, and more protein, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. As a result, the National School Lunch Program restricted milk options to flavored and unflavored skim and low-fat milk, effectively banning whole milk, with exceptions for children with proper documentation of certain medical situations, said Amy Reed, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Related article
      RFK Jr. wants to eliminate FDA’s controversial food additive program. Here’s why that matters “If the child was underweight, the school would have to provide the higher-calorie milk,” Reed said. Similarly, for children with milk allergies, schools must provide an alternative milk. The effect of milk on children’s health These federal policies are centered around concerns about saturated fat, the consumption of which has been linked with cardiovascular disease and obesity. Regardless of the differences in calories and fat, higher- and lower-fat milks have similar nutrient profiles, Reed said. Whole milk has 3.25% to 3.5% milk fat, compared with 1% or 2% in low-fat milk and 0.5% in fat-free milk, according to the American Heart Association. “All milk is fortified with vitamin D, and the vitamin D and the calcium work together to help with bone strength and help increase the absorption of both,” Reed added. “There’s also some presence of potassium and magnesium phosphorus, which are all other minerals known for bone health. The potassium and sodium can be thought to be working together to help with blood pressure when you’re talking about adults.” As the dietary guidelines are being revised this year for the 2025-30 edition, the advisory committee has reviewed research on milk and human health and recommended sticking with the current guidance. “There’s evidence to show that the (Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act) really did improve the quality of food that was provided to kids,” Reed said. The dietary guidelines committee found limited evidence that higher-fat milk may be associated with health benefits for growth, body composition and obesity risk among children ages 2 through 5.

      Over half of US states are trying to eliminate food dyes. Here’s what you can do now However, even though the committee said it didn’t find benefit or harm for older people, it also said it couldn’t draw conclusions due to “substantial concerns” about existing research — and that the evidence wasn’t sufficient to advise changing the current guidelines. An argument for whole milk The continuing recommendation from the federal government that full-fat dairy be avoided is a “very strange conclusion to me,” said cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston. “Expecting to prove a negative is a strange precedent.” “We regulate saturated fat as a monolith, as though it’s all the same, but it’s not,” he added. “Different types of saturated fats have different molecular structures.” Some studies have found that dairy fat is rich in medium-chain triglycerides, which may have metabolic benefits in terms of improvement of type 2 diabetes, Mozaffarian said. There have also been studies linking consumption of dairy fat to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. But that doesn’t mean all full-fat dairy products will reduce risk; some, such as milk and yogurt, have a neutral relationship to the disease. “I think it’s actually strongly evidence-based to let whole milk not only get back to schools but get back on the tables and in glasses of Americans — not just whole milk but [also] whole-fat yogurt and whole-fat cheese,” Mozaffarian said. “Not only is dairy fat not linked to any negative outcomes; dairy fat [is] also actually observationally linked to low risk of diabetes.” Related video
      Eggs will be expensive for a long time. Here’s the substitute you never thought of Additionally, in the absence of whole milk, some children dislike the flavor of plain lower-fat milks and opt for chocolate- or strawberry-flavored lower-fat milks, which have more sugar, experts said. Children need a well-balanced diet Regardless of the type of fat children consume, Mozaffarian and Reed urged the importance of considering the overall diet, rather than individual ingredients. Like adults, children should have a diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and healthy fats. That’s why Mozaffarian’s concerned about the lack of attention to ultraprocessed foods in schools and the federal government’s significant cuts to programs supplying fresh food to schools and food banks across the nation — while lawmakers consider legislation that would require higher-fat milks in schools for what they say are health reasons. “We need more dollars to pay for healthy food for kids,” Mozaffarian said. “We’re giving kids the cheapest possible food in school and then paying for it 10 times over in health care spending. That’s just shortsighted. “We should be doubling, tripling our investments in healthy food across the country, including schools.”",,0.1773303598165512
"(CNN) — What does it take to reach age 70 and not have any chronic diseases? A team of researchers led by scientists from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health sought to answer this question by following over 100,000 Americans in their 40s, 50s and 60s for up to three decades. The results, published March 24 in the journal Nature Medicine, found that healthy diets earlier in life were associated with a higher likelihood of healthy aging, even after accounting for other lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and smoking status. I wanted to better understand which diets could lead to higher odds of healthy aging. How might these study findings affect people’s nutrition choices during midlife and other periods in their lives? To learn more, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. Related article
      Top-rated diet lowers cancer risk in a surprising way, new study finds CNN: How long did researchers spend looking at people’s eating habits? What did they learn? Dr. Leana Wen: This is a longitudinal observational study, meaning that researchers followed the same group over time and studied self-reported habits and health outcomes. Researchers asked study participants for their nutrition habits over up to three decades, until they reached age 70. Participants regularly and extensively documented their food consumption, reporting how often they ate more than 130 different foods. The study team then classified the food consumption by measuring how close the consumption pattern was to eight types of healthy diets and to the consumption of unhealthy ultraprocessed food. At the end of the study period three decades later, researchers found that 9,771 out of 105,015 participants, or about 9.3%, achieved what they defined as healthy aging, which is living to 70 years of age free of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, and not having cognitive, physical or mental health impairments. The study team found that for each of the eight healthy diets, higher adherence was associated with greater likelihood of healthy aging. In addition, the researchers found that higher consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated fats and low-fat dairy products was linked with greater odds of healthy aging. On the other hand, higher consumption of trans fats, sodium, sugary beverages, and red or processed meats was associated with lower odds of healthy aging. Related article
      Ultraprocessed foods make up to 70% of the US food supply. How to reduce your intake In my view, this was a sound study that demonstrates quite convincingly that following a healthy diet earlier in life is a key factor involved in healthy aging. This research is consistent with other studies that have found people can gain years in life expectancy by eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains and nuts and avoiding sugary drinks and processed food. CNN: What are the eight types of diets that were included in this study? Wen: The study participants did not self-identify that they were following a particular diet. They reported their food consumption, and researchers correlated their long-term adherence to dietary patterns that are considered to be healthy. The eight diets were the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), the Alternative Mediterranean Index (aMED), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND), the healthful plant-based diet (hPDI), the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI), the empirically inflammatory dietary pattern (EDIP), and the empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH). These diet patterns share numerous commonalities. For instance, aMED and MIND are based on the Mediterranean diet, rich in plant-based foods, lean proteins and healthy fats. PHDI and hPDI maximize the consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes. There are some differences — for example, DASH emphasizes reduced sodium, EDIP uses an inflammatory index for foods, and EDIH scores food by anticipated insulin secretion. CNN: How could these results affect people’s nutrition choices during midlife? Wen: These findings should prompt people to think about a nutritious diet as a key component of healthy aging. When making nutrition choices, everyone should aim for whole foods that are minimally processed, such as leafy green vegetables, fresh fruits and whole grains. This study and others consistently show the benefits of nuts as well as legumes, such as beans and lentils. Fish and lean meat can also be part of a healthy diet. On the other hand, highly processed meats, such as deli cold cuts and fried chicken, are associated with worse health outcomes. Related article
      Mediterranean diet could improve your kid’s heart health. Here’s how to follow it, according to experts CNN: What about younger individuals? Do their diet habits matter? Wen: This study examined dietary habits of people through their 40s, 50s and 60s. It didn’t look at nutrition habits earlier in life. But based on other studies, it’s reasonable to recommend that everyone, no matter their age, should aim for a healthy diet, while also keeping in mind that it’s never too late to start developing healthier habits. CNN: It may be obvious, but what did the study suggest we should not be eating? Wen: While much of the focus of the study is on types of diet and food that are positively associated with healthy aging, there are also items that are negatively associated. Notably, these include sugar-sweetened beverages, such as sodas and fruit drinks with added sugar, as well as ultraprocessed foods and items with high levels of sodium and trans fats. Everyone can make a conscious effort to reduce their consumption of sodas, fruit drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages. They can also try to cut their consumption of ultraprocessed food, which has been linked in numerous other studies to higher risk of mortality. Looking at the packaging label is always a good way to assess whether the food may be ultraprocessed. If it has a long list of ingredients with many additives, the item is probably ultraprocessed and is best replaced with a similar food that has minimal processing. Labels can also provide information on levels of sodium and trans fats. Related article

In many communities, ultraprocessed food is cheaper and more readily accessible than fresh fruits and vegetables. Studies like this one can help make the case that optimizing people’s diets and helping them to access nutritious food can reduce chronic disease, which is essential to ensuring a healthy workforce and reducing health care costs down the line. Policymakers should look at the important role that food has in determining people’s well-being and help make the food environment one that is most conducive to long-term health.",,0.2473725825548172
"Older women who stayed on a reduced-calorie Mediterranean diet, walked and did resistance training for three years improved their bone density, especially in their lower backs, a new study found. “A reduced-energy Mediterranean diet involves participants consuming a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet with approximately 30% fewer calories than their usual intake,” said coauthor Jesús Francisco García-Gavilán, a senior biostatistician at the University Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona, Spain. Related article
      Top-rated diet lowers cancer risk in a surprising way, new study finds Women in the study, who ranged in age from 55 to 75, were also able to prevent bone deterioration that typically occurs during weight loss, according to the research published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open. “Previous research has indicated that losing weight, particularly through diet alone, can lead to a reduction in bone density, which poses risks for older adults. Additionally, exercising alone does not always prevent this issue,” García-Gavilán said in an email. “What is new in this study is the finding that combining a well-balanced, reduced-calorie Mediterranean diet with physical activity can prevent bone loss in older women, even while they are losing weight,” he said. “This emphasizes that the type of diet is important during weight loss, not just the calorie intake.” The results of the study are not that surprising, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. “When you practice the lifestyle that human beings were always meant to live, which is moving a lot and eating predominantly simple, plant-based foods, all sorts of systems get better, including bone density,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the new research. Why the Mediterranean diet? The new study is part of the PREDIMED-Plus trial, a randomized clinical trial on lifestyle interventions conducted in 23 medical centers and hospitals in Spain. The trial included 924 older adults with metabolic syndrome who were overweight or had obesity. Half were randomized to eating a Mediterranean diet with no restrictions on calories and no requirement to exercise. The other half were encouraged to walk for a minimum of 45 minutes per day six days per week and to do strength, flexibility and balance exercises three days per week. Their diet was cut to about 30% fewer calories than they typically consumed and only from a Mediterranean-style eating plan. Women in this group saw significantly stronger bones at one year and at three years into the study. Related article
      Mediterranean diet helps women live much longer, a large new study finds “While previous results from the PREDIMED-Plus trial highlighted benefits for maintaining lean mass and losing weight, this is the first publication to demonstrate that these lifestyle changes can also help preserve bone density, especially in older women,” García-Gavilán said. The award-winning Mediterranean diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with much of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are avoided. Red meat is used sparingly, often only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. Eating the Mediterranean way has been linked to reductions in the risk for breast cancer, dementia, depression, diabetes, high cholesterol and memory loss. Adherence to the diet can also lead to a healthier heart, weight loss and longer life. Related article
      This diet with exercise reduces dangerous belly fat and more, study says But exactly why would the meal plan help preserve bone? “The Mediterranean diet is rich in nutrients that promote bone health,” García-Gavilán said. “Nuts and dairy products provide essential calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. Healthy fats, such as those found in olive oil, have been shown to reduce inflammation.” Antioxidants such as vitamin C from fruits and vegetables may help protect and support bone cells, García-Gavilán added, while other important vitamins, like vitamin K found in vegetables such as spinach, play a role in bone formation. “Together, these nutrients can lower the risk of bone loss and support bone maintenance, especially as we age,” García-Gavilán said. “Understanding this nutritional context is crucial for maintaining our long-term quality of life.” Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.",,0.2022593915462494
"Editor’s note: Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.” As people get older, stiffness and reduced mobility can feel inevitable, leading to the common belief that maintaining flexibility requires long, tedious stretching routines. But that’s not the case. You don’t need to spend hours stretching to move well as you age — you just need to move smarter. By incorporating simple, intentional movement habits into your daily life, you can improve and maintain your mobility over time, keeping your body functional and resilient as you grow older. Related article
      ‘Exercise snacks’ — even a few minutes a day — can boost your health While aging brings natural changes to your body, such as reduced muscle mass, joint stiffness and slower recovery, losing mobility doesn’t have to be one of them. Aging itself doesn’t automatically limit your mobility — lack of movement does. Many people become more sedentary as they get older, exacerbating age-related muscle loss and joint stiffness. When you stop moving through a full range of motion regularly, your body adapts by reducing that range. This is true at any age, but it becomes even more impactful as you mature. The good news? Mobility loss isn’t inevitable. Simple, strategic habits can keep you moving well for life. Think about how you move throughout the day: reaching for objects, pulling open doors, squatting to tie your shoes, rotating to grab a seat belt, and stabilizing your core to sit and stand upright. These natural movements occur in multiple directions and planes of motion, yet many people fail to train them regularly. Just like everyday movement patterns, exercises should be performed in all three planes of motion: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational). Related article
      Bothered by back pain? Here’s how some pro athletes prevent it Training movement in all the ways your body is designed to move helps you stay functional and mobile while also working to prevent pain and injury as you age. Mobility isn’t just about workouts — it’s about how you move all day long. If you spend most of your time sitting, your body adapts to that position, leading to tight hips and weaker postural muscles. Instead of relying on lengthy stretching routines that aren’t always effective, incorporate small movement breaks into your day by getting up and moving for just a few minutes. Even if you don’t have a lot of room to move, it helps to change positions frequently and try to reach, twist and bend in natural ways. One way to make regular daily movement into a habit is through “habit stacking,” in which you pair an exercise with something you already do. For example, every time you get up from a chair, you could do five air squats or four step-back lunges. Starting your day with just five minutes of movement can have a significant impact on how you feel and move throughout the day. And a short mobility routine, such as morning yoga, posture exercises at your desk or targeted stretches from the comfort of your couch, done consistently will make a big difference in your ability to move well over time. Daily mobility work isn’t just about staying flexible — it’s also an opportunity to check in with your body. Moving through a regular routine allows you to identify areas of tightness or discomfort before they become bigger issues. If you experience pain or limited movement that doesn’t improve, consult your doctor, physical therapist or movement specialist to address potential underlying concerns. Strength training is an important component for maintaining movement quality as you age. Strength exercises support mobility by keeping joints stable and preserving muscle mass to prevent stiffness-related weakness and improve recovery capacity. Strength training can be done using free weights, machines or simply the resistance of your own body weight. Even two short 10-minute strength sessions per week can prove beneficial, especially when focusing on compound movements — exercises that engage multiple muscle groups and joints at once. These movements mimic real-life actions, making them more functional than isolated exercises. To maximize mobility benefits, it’s also important to include compound movements that work across all three planes of motion. Related article
      Stop stretching your shoulders! Here’s what actually works for stiff muscles Examples include squats (sagittal plane), lateral lunges (frontal plane) and standing torso twists (transverse plane). Prioritizing compound movements in all planes of motion ensures that your strength training enhances mobility rather than making you feel stiff or restricted. Your breathing pattern directly affects how you move and feel in your body. Shallow chest breathing creates excess tension in the neck, shoulders and rib cage that limits movement and often results in chronic pain. Several times a day, try to focus on diaphragmatic breathing in which inhales expand the lower ribs more than the upper chest. And be sure to practice extended exhales, as instructed below, completely emptying your lungs to help reduce upper-body tension to improve mobility and engage and align your core for increased stability. Try this simple breathing exercise: •     Sit with your feet on the floor. •     Place your hands on your lower ribs. •     As you inhale deep into your lungs, you should feel the expansion of your lower ribs under your hands. •     As you exhale fully, your hands will ride your ribs back to their starting position. •     If you can, try to extend your exhale to double the count of your inhale. For instance, if you inhale for a count of four, try to exhale for a count of eight. •     Take five or more breaths in this pattern at least once a day — more, if possible. Related article

"Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. When Nike unveiled its now-famous slogan “Just do it” in 1988, it helped propel the US-based sportswear company to worldwide fame. Ordinary people also began invoking the catchphrase to motivate themselves to tackle daunting tasks, such as sticking to an exercise routine. That’s no surprise to researchers, who have found motivational quotes, mantras and positive self-talk help people in myriad ways. Related article
      How long does it take to see benefits from your new workout regimen? College students who listened to the mantra of their choice were more cheerful and had more clarity of mind afterward, according to a 2018 pilot study in the Journal of Religion and Health, while self-talk strategies facilitated learning and enhanced sports performance, a meta-analysis published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science found. Researchers also uncovered a positive connection between human health and mantra meditation — the practice of focusing your mind by repeatedly chanting a mantra — in a 2022 review published in the International Journal of Yoga. The use of mantra meditation for stress relief and coping with high blood pressure was especially promising. With mantras and mottos so helpful, many fitness coaches incorporate them when working with their clients. “I find them extremely useful,” said Alysha Flynn, a women’s running coach and founder of the training program What Runs You based in York, Pennsylvania. “They help people refocus their mind and develop a sustainable habit that keeps them moving and healthy for a long time.” Motivation can be fleeting, agreed Kaya Luciani, a coach with the virtual training app Future based in Raleigh, North Carolina. “A more reliable source of drive comes from our mindset,” Luciani said. “While mottos are bite-sized, they are also a really powerful way to hone and train our mindset. They get people thinking, ‘Maybe it is as easy as just doing it.’” Related article
      Yes, you should talk to yourself. Here’s how to tame your inner voice Finding your mantra or motto While mantras such as “Just do it” and “Yes, you can!” are popular, they don’t work for everyone. Each person has to find the particular phrase or sentence that speaks to them. Choosing something that’s short and easy to remember is best, said Flynn, who doesn’t recommend finding a mantra through research. “I usually encourage clients to let the words just find them,” Flynn said. “That’s what will make the mantra resonate more deeply.” Mantras and mottos are definitely personal, Luciani agreed. “I don’t suggest a specific phrase or quote to a client,” she said. “They often develop naturally and always end up being something that just clicks with a client in some way.” While not everyone will be helped by adopting a fitness motto, the two coaches have noticed some commonalities when using them with their clients. Younger women often adopt phrases such as “I can do hard things,” because they want to prove something to themselves, Flynn said. “But for women who are 35 or 45, their mantras are more about grace and understanding and honoring themselves.” Related article
      How to be kinder to yourself, according to science Luciani, who coaches both men and women, doesn’t see huge differences in the mottos selected by each sex. Instead, she finds the mantras people adopt are more associated with their personality type and lifestyle. “Phrases that are more cut-and-dried like ‘Just do it’ or ‘Suck it up!’ align more with masculine energy, for example, whether that energy is in a man or woman,” Luciani said. One piece of the exercise puzzle Both women said they use mantras and mottos as one piece of their coaching, and more as a supplemental tool that glues together a client’s exercise program. More importantly, the coaches said, individuals need to assess where they are at in their fitness journey, along with the aspirations they have set for themselves. “When it comes to developing fitness goals and setting a pace for yourself, it’s very important that you don’t get the temptation to dive in headfirst all at once,” Luciani said. “That heightens your risk of stumbling into an all-or-nothing mentality, which is very common when folks are developing a new pattern.” Related article
      Wellness perfectionism doesn’t exist. Focus on these sustainable habits For seasoned exercisers, it’s important to push yourself a little outside your comfort zone, Luciani said. If you don’t, you’ll risk becoming bored or disengaged, she said. “Ensuring you’re challenging yourself in an engaging way is just as important as not going overboard,” Luciani said. You should also ponder the thoughts or processes that might have been ingrained into you since you were a child, whether that’s a rigid training protocol or believing you’re a failure if you haven’t achieved a set goal. “It helps if you develop a mindset that’s more adaptable and flexible,” Flynn said. “Training is not a linear process.” Both Luciani and Flynn have used fitness mantras themselves, and they change over time. Luciani said she recently wrote on a sticky note, “You can do this.” “There’s not much to it,” Luciani said. “But having those words in front of your face every day can be something you really need one day and then a little whisper in your ear another. Your needs can ebb and flow.” Related article
      The best resistance bands in 2025, tried and tested (Courtesy CNN Underscored) One motto that currently resonates with Flynn is “Because you can.” “I have a deep understanding that, at some point in time, I won’t have the same fitness opportunities because my body won’t be physically capable of doing an activity,” Flynn said. “So I use it to squeeze out another drop now, while I’m able to do so.” Overall, the essence of using a motto to improve your fitness is understanding that your internal dialogue can be a powerful asset in changing your behavior. “We all can use words to train our minds, just as we train our body,” Luciani said.

You may be able to lower your risk for developing heart rhythm abnormalities by speeding up your walking pace. That’s according to a large new study published Tuesday in the journal Heart, which found average or brisk walking paces were associated with 35% and 43% lower risks of all heart rhythm abnormalities studied, respectively, compared with a slow pace. Those abnormalities are the arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, bradyarrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, is the most common arrhythmia, characterized by an irregular and rapid heartbeat beginning in the upper chambers, or atria, of the heart. Bradyarrhythmias are abnormally slow heart rates of typically below 60 beats per minute, compared with the normal range of 60 to 100 beats per minute. Ventricular arrhythmias occur when the lower chambers of the heart, or ventricles, beat too fast. Related article
      How to recognize signs of a stroke with the acronym BE FAST “The great thing about walking is that it is accessible to everyone,” said senior study author Dr. Jill Pell, the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, via email. “You don’t need to spend money going to a gym or buying equipment. You can just walk out of your front door and keep going.” Nearly 60 million people worldwide have atrial fibrillation, according to a 2024 study. Estimates of people with other arrhythmias are less conclusive, but in general, people with arrhythmias are at higher risk of having heart attacks or strokes and dying early, Pell said. “There are medicines and procedures that can be offered to these people but it would be preferable to prevent heart rhythm abnormalities from occurring in the first place,” Pell added. Additionally, to the authors’ knowledge, there has been only one previous study on walking pace and heart rhythm abnormalities, and it focused on just one type of arrhythmia, Pell said. And past research has indicated that “walking pace is linked to other outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, so we wanted to see if the same was true of heart rhythm abnormalities,” Pell said. The authors studied health and activity data from adults who had been recruited between 2006 and 2010 for the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than 500,000 people between the ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom. Participants answered questionnaires that asked whether their walking pace was slow (less than 3 miles or 4.8 kilometers per hour), average (3 to 4 miles or 4.8 to 6.4 kilometers per hour) or brisk (more than 4 miles or 6.4 kilometers per hour). During a follow-up period of 13 years on average, 9% of participants developed arrhythmias. Related article
      Diet drinks may boost risk of dangerous heart condition by 20%, study says “We had data on self-reported walking pace from more than 420,000 people but we also had accelerometry data on (nearly) 82,000 of these,” Pell said, referring to data from watches that track movement speed. “The data from the watches showed that walking at an average pace (3-4 miles per hour) for only 5-15 minutes per day was sufficient to reduce your risk.” The associations were strongest among people under 60, people without obesity, those with high blood pressure or two or more preexisting conditions, and women, the authors found. “This is an interesting finding because, although women are less likely to get atrial fibrillation than men, when they do get it they are at a higher risk of going on to get heart attacks and strokes than men with atrial fibrillation,” Pell said. Cardiologist Dr. Martha Gulati found the study important and said it confirms earlier related research — by herself and others — that showed benefits of physical activity for atrial fibrillation and stronger associations among women. “This shows that one of the primary prevention strategies to reduce cardiac arrhythmias is brisk walking,” added Gulati, director of preventive cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Gulati wasn’t involved in the research. The relationship between walking and heart speeds Since the study is observational, it doesn’t prove a cause and effect, the authors said. Self-reported health data is also vulnerable to inaccurate recollections or biases. In observational studies, there’s always a risk that people who walk slower do so because they already have disease, Pell said. Related article
      Why ‘cardiac clearance’ could save your life “We did everything possible to avoid this by making sure that no one had any type of heart or vascular disease at the beginning of the study,” she added. “However, we really need an intervention study now to confirm our findings: a study of people who walk slowly in which some are asked to increase their walking pace and some are not,” Pell said. A-Fib is associated with multiple risk factors that are also linked with conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, said Dr. Sean Heffron, director of cardiovascular fitness and nutrition at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at New York University. He was not involved in the study. Participants who walked faster were more likely to be men, live in less deprived areas, have healthier lifestyles and weigh less. They also had better grip strength, smaller waists and lower levels of inflammation and metabolic risk factors such as high cholesterol or blood sugar. “And bradyarrhythmias or ventricular arrhythmias are nonspecific and can have lots of other causes and certainly are far less clearly associated with lifestyle-type factors than is atrial fibrillation,” Heffron added. “I feel like lumping them all together was interesting.” The authors found that over one-third of the beneficial effect of a faster pace “was due to the fact that walking faster reduces cholesterol, glucose and blood pressure and makes you less likely to put on weight,” Pell said, noting that those reductions lower your risk of heart rate abnormalities.

"Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes here. Americans are in the middle of a love-affair with protein. A stroll through almost any major supermarket — where food labels tout grams of protein — bears witness to the trend. And why shouldn’t we be? Along with carbohydrates and fat, protein is one of the three main macronutrients that make up our diet. Furthermore, it is the only macronutrient that supplies us with amino acids, making it essential for survival. Amino acids have a hand in many bodily processes, such as building and preserving muscle, making hormones and neurotransmitters, boosting the immune system, even maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. And while our bodies can make some of the needed amino acids, it can’t make them all. Enter dietary protein. What is the optimal amount you should be getting? The answer is that it’s complicated. The US recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of protein for adults 18 and older is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound) per day, which translates to about 54 grams of protein for a 150-pound person, or 72 grams for someone weighing 200 pounds. Established jointly by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Health and Human Services, the RDA represents the minimum amount of protein that must be eaten by a relatively sedentary person to meet the basic needs of their body. There’s also something called the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR), which was developed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to establish ranges for carbohydrates, fat and protein that are associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases. Those guidelines, which put intake within the context of an entire diet, recommend protein make up between 10% and 35% of the calories in an adult’s diet. (The number of calories per day an adult should be getting depends on characteristics such as age, sex, weight and activity level.) Related article
      Muscle-building supplements may put teens at risk for a body image disorder, study finds All that is to say, there is no exact number for the amount of protein that you should be getting. If you look at the statistics, most people in the United States are getting more than enough; if you listen to some influencers, you are not getting enough. “I was in L.A., and I did some interviews there, and nine out of 10 people I asked, ‘What did you have for breakfast?’ — it was raw eggs or protein bars or protein smoothies. It was amazing,” Dr. Tim Spector told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life. Spector is a genetic epidemiologist and researcher at King’s College London and founder of one of the world’s largest twins registries, TWINS UK. “They’ve been sort of brainwashed into thinking that they have to move on to protein because they’re somehow deficient and they’re not going to be lean and have a six-pack and be running marathons (if they don’t),” he said. Spector is also author of several best-selling books including “Food for Life: The New Science of Eating Well.” (He’s also a co-founder of ZOE, a personalized nutrition app). You can listen to the full episode here. Spector has nothing at all against protein per se. “In general, protein is pretty good, particularly if it’s plant protein — but, nothing wrong with meat protein in moderation. But it’s what it replaces,” he said. “We need to start thinking much more holistically.” “Studies have shown that Americans have more than enough protein,” he added. “There might be a few exceptions out there, but most people are already on twice the amount, and yet 90% of Americans are deficient in fiber.” Spector said certain groups may require a bit more protein: older adults, people going through menopause   or recovering from serious illness, those with restrictive diets and people who are “training incredibly hard.” But the rest of us — in the United States, at least — do just fine. (Many people in developing countries do not get adequate protein.) If you find that you need it, how can you get some additional high-quality protein into your diet — while benefiting from other important nutrients and without relying on highly processed sweetened powders and snack bars? Here are Spector’s top five tips. Beans are loaded with nutrients “They come in many forms — black, pinto, broad, kidney, and more — but they never get the attention they deserve,”  said Spector via email. “They’re all good sources of healthy plant protein,” he noted.

      A lowly vegetable rises to stardom in newly released dietary advisory report Beans are also loaded with other good-for-you nutrients. “Importantly, they also contain fiber (a nutrient that most people really are deficient in), and other healthy plant compounds, like polyphenols,” he said. Load up on the three-bean salad or bean burrito. Those beans are inexpensive, come in a wide variety and, if you buy them dried, are extremely shelf-stable. Go whole hog on whole grains Hearty and versatile, whole grains — such as barley, brown rice, buckwheat, bulgur, corn, millet, oats, quinoa, rye and whole wheat — contain the entire grain kernel, including the bran, germ and endosperm. “Whole grains are good for a wide range of reasons,” said Spector via email. “They are a great source of fiber and include a wide range of micronutrients. They’re also much higher in protein than people expect. For instance, oats have 11g of protein per 100g compared with 13g per 100g for eggs.” Related article
      Add this superfood to your diet to help manage weight and lower blood pressure “Regularly consuming whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of many health conditions, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes,” he noted. An easy way to get more in your diet? “Swap products that contain highly refined grains — like white rice, pasta, and bread — for whole grain versions, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and wholewheat bread,” he said. Replace some meat with plant-based alternatives Many of us love a good burger or steak, but eating too much of a good thing is not so good for you. “It’s true that meat is a great source of protein,” Spector said. “However, for your health and the health of the planet, it’s best to reduce your meat intake, particularly red and processed meat.” “Some people worry that most plants are not complete proteins, so they might be missing out on specific amino acids,” he noted. “But each plant source of protein has a unique amino acid profile. By consuming a wide variety of plants, you will naturally take in all the amino acids you need.” Related article
      Certain vegetarian diets significantly reduce risk of cancer, heart disease and death, study says And  don’t panic. Nobody is saying you have to cut out meat entirely. “Consider replacing half of the meat in your stews, chilis, or soups with mixed lentils and beans, tofu, or tempeh, or have one or two vegetarian or pescetarian days each week,” he said. When you do eat meat, Spector added, “try to choose good quality products and opt for leaner cuts.” Go nuts over nuts and seeds “Many people avoid nuts and seeds because they’re relatively high in fat,” Spector said. “Although this is true, they contain healthy unsaturated fats, like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which support good health.” It may come as no surprise to find “they’re also a good source of healthy plant protein and a wide range of vitamins and minerals,” he said. Related article
      Why it’s nutty not to eat nuts for good health If you are not a fan of munching on straight-up nuts or seeds, Spector said you can sprinkle them on most dishes “savory or sweet — to provide extra texture and flavor.” Consider adding them to your yogurt parfait, salad or stew. Peanut butter is also a good choice, he said, “but find a product with as few ingredients as possible, and no added sugar or salt.” The joy of soy “Soy is one of the few complete proteins in the plant world,” Spector said. “It’s also incredibly versatile and can easily be incorporated into meals. Consider adding tofu, tempeh or edamame to the dishes you already love.” As an added bonus, he said, “soy products contain fiber and are rich in vitamins and minerals.” When it comes to protein, Spector said most people should seek out quality over quantity. “Focus on plants, and ignore products that claim to be high in protein, because they’re probably also high in salt, sugar, and other additives your body doesn’t need,” he said. We hope these five tips help you add healthy protein to your diet. Listen to the full episode here. And join us next week for a new episode of the Chasing Life podcast.

"Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. Find yourself yawning a lot? Do you need that third or fourth cup of coffee to make it through the afternoon at work? Such signs of sleepiness may be a red flag of a serious sleep deficit that could put you in physical danger and harm your long-term health, according to a new position paper by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. “Sleepiness is a serious health concern with wide-reaching consequences,” said AASM President Dr. Eric Olson, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Related article
      Cognitive shuffling: A mental trick to help you quiet racing thoughts and fall asleep “From drowsy driving crashes to workplace errors and long-term health risks, the effects of excessive daytime sleepiness impact individuals and society every day,” Olson said in a statement about the paper, which is supported by 25 different medical organizations including the American Academy of Neurology, the National Safety Council and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Not getting a quality night’s rest of at least seven to eight hours has been linked to the development or worsening of diabetes, depression, heart and kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity and stroke, experts say. “With one-third of U.S. adults reporting they experience excessive sleepiness, the importance of identifying interventions that recognize, assess, and treat it cannot be understated,” Olson added. All too often people write off signs of sleepiness, such as dozing off during a work meeting, as an insignificant issue instead of a sign of a potentially dangerous sleep deficit, experts say. “Nodding off in boring meetings is an indication of insufficient sleep. Someone who is fully rested will not fall asleep in meetings, no matter how boring the meeting is,” said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “Excessive daytime sleepiness can impair performance and be an indicator of underlying sleep disorders or other issues,” Knutson said via email. “If someone is experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness regularly, they should discuss this with their physician.” A hidden danger The body does odd things when it’s continuously sleepy, including overcoming those yawns and sending signals that you are, in fact, coping with the lack of sleep. However, those signals couldn’t be further from the truth, said AASM board member and second author Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, a professor of sleep medicine at the Veteran’s Administration Medical Center at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. “The unfortunate thing is data shows that with chronic partial sleep deprivation the ability to perceive our own level of impairment is no longer accurate — we think we’re OK when we’re really not,” Gurubhagavatula said.

      Don’t let politics ruin your sleep. Use these expert tips instead “When we do actual tests to measure how well your brain is functioning — reaction time, the ability to recall, memory tests, coordination — we find people are actually making a lot of mistakes,” she said. “And it’s scary because they still have this inappropriately high level of confidence that they are OK.” With continued sleepiness, the brain may take mini naps, or what specialists call microsleeps, Gurubhagavatula said. “Your brain is actually going into brief two-second, three-second, 10-second microsleeps and then popping back out and you may not even realize this is happening,” she said. “It can be very dangerous if you’re driving or doing something that involves safety. So if you do feel like you might fall asleep, pay attention to that, as it’s an indication it’s not safe to drive.” About 100,000 car accidents a year are linked to drowsy driving, according to statistics. Tests of sleepiness How do you know if your sleepiness is crossing into the danger zone? You can measure it on various scales, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Gurubhagavatula said. Questions on the test include how likely you’ll fall asleep while sitting quietly after a lunch with no alcohol; lying down in the afternoon; sitting inactive in a public place; sitting and reading; sitting and chatting with someone; riding as a passenger in a car for an hour; sitting in traffic for a few minutes while driving; and watching television.

      Sexsomnia: An embarrassing sleep disorder no one wants to talk about “We ask patients to rate from zero to three how likely they are to fall asleep during these eight sedentary situations,” she said. “The maximum score is 24, which indicates that you’re very, very sleepy. We generally consider scores above 10 to being clinically significant and worth intervention.” As sleep deprivation progresses, dangerous symptoms of sleepiness can increase, Gurubhagavatula said. “You have droopy eyelids, your body is slumping, you’re having trouble staying upright, and some people even notice vertigo, the room spinning, hands shaking with severe deprivation,” she said. “You can also be reckless and impulsive, like you don’t care. That’s another symptom.” Additional causes of sleepiness Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as well as chronic pain conditions and medications can also contribute to sleepiness, which will be ruled out by a sleep specialist. “You can also ask your pharmacist about your prescriptions, and you should also consider any over-the-counter medications,” Gurubhagavatula said. Certain lifestyle behaviors also can contribute to chronic sleepiness, experts say. “Things like too much caffeine, alcohol use before bed, using marijuana, the amount of exercise you’re doing, and practicing poor sleep hygiene, such as sleeping in a bright, cold, hot or noisy bedroom, will definitely affect how your sleep will be organized and how refreshing it’s going to be,” Gurubhagavatula said.

      Sleep training for adults prevents depression, study finds Many people turn to alcohol or marijuana in the mistaken belief that it can improve sleep. While alcohol appears to make it easier to fall asleep, the body will wake in the middle of the night once the alcohol is metabolized, experts say. “I have patients that are very surprised how much better their sleep is when they get rid of that one drink they have with dinner,”Gurubhagavatula said. “As for marijuana, we know it actually has unwanted side effects on sleep. The efficiency of your sleep decreases, and how tired you feel the next day increases, so sleep quality actually starts to go down.”",,0.2134108990430832
"Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes here. When people are young, if they are fortunate enough to enjoy good health, they get to move their bodies with carefree abandon — running, jumping, bending, dancing, twisting — in pursuit of whatever activity they are engaged in. But if they are lucky enough to get older, life intervenes: Free time becomes more limited, and interests, responsibilities, habits and behavior all change. Many people abandon the playground and learn to sit — in a classroom, at the office, in front of the TV, in a car. Then at some point, many notice they have grown stiffer, and maybe it hurts to do this movement or that one, or they can no longer move in all the ways they want to. And people often attribute the aches and pains to simply getting older — but is the change inevitable? “The one thing that doesn’t have to change over the whole lifespan is your range of motion,” Dr. Kelly Starrett, a physical therapist and former professional athlete, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life. Related article
      Wellness perfectionism doesn’t exist. Focus on these sustainable habits Quantifying mobility has been, excuse the pun, a moving target. “Every physician on the planet, every physical therapist, every chiropractic physician, all agree about what the body should be able to do. We’ve said, here’s what blood pressure is, and everyone knows that. Here’s what (body) temperature is, and everyone knows that. We started to become very sophisticated about understanding some aspects of our physiology, but not range of motion,” Starrett said. “What ended up happening is we created this definition of (mobility): Do you have access to your native range of motion? Can you control it? And, when we improve those things, did what matters to you improve?” he asked. Starrett’s most recent book, coauthored with his wife, Juliet Starrett, is “Built To Move: The 10 Essential Habits To Help You Move Freely and Live Fully.” It addresses mobility: measuring it (with 10 tests) and, equally important, regaining it in small increments that don’t take up all your time. “How do we simplify the process so it doesn’t feel so overwhelming?” he asked. “I’m not giving a busy working mother another listicle.” You can listen to the full episode here. Why should you care about range of motion and mobility when the couch is so comfy and many of your needs and wants are only a mouse click away? Because mobility is associated with longevity, Starrett said. He noted that falling is a big predictor of injury and decline in people age 65 and older. “If I don’t have access to balance or range of motion, I can’t solve as many movement problems. And losing your balance is a movement problem,” he said. “Getting up and down and being independent is a movement problem. Being able to rise from a chair while you’re holding your baby or your cat, or holding a cup of coffee and a book is just a movement problem.” As you get older, your body is more likely to “throw an error,” Starrett said. It’s a matter of use it or lose it. “If I want to have a joint and tendons that act like joints and tendons my whole life, I better use that joint and I better load those tendons,” he said. “Otherwise, they’re not going to be available to me as readily.” Muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs, he said. “They always adapt. At no age do you stop healing. At no age do you lose the ability to reclaim range of motion. It’s going to be a little slower than when you were 15 — that’s true. But the bottom line is your body is always going to adapt.” What can you do to easily retain or regain some of your mobility? Starrett has five tips. Get your body into different shapes People mostly move from lying down to sitting in a chair to walking around a bit, Starrett noted. “Modern environments don’t really ask much of the movement language of our bodies. Most people are only using a few words that their bodies could write,” he said. “The first thing we should be thinking about is, ‘Well, how do I increase my exposure to more movement language?’” he said. Related article
      Spend 5 minutes a day moving like this and you’ll move better for life “One of the easiest ways, for example, that we think would foundationally change society is if people sat on the ground in the evening, for 20 or 30 minutes while they were watching TV, while they’re reading a book,” he said. “And that could be leaning up against the couch; it doesn’t have to be in a strict lotus.” Getting into and out of that cross-legged position will also expose you to different movements, especially in the hips and knees. The practice can also tell you a bit about your ability to move freely and effortlessly. “Being able to get up and down from a cross-legged position is an excellent predictor of all-cause morbidity and all-cause mortality because … it says a lot about how you are interacting and adapting to your environment,” he said. And if you need to fidget, fidget — because that will also get your body into additional interesting positions, he said, such as kneeling or squatting. For more ideas on getting your body into different shapes, you can watch short instructional videos on Starrett’s The Ready State YouTube channel. Hang from a bar 3 minutes a day If you’re experiencing aches and pains in your shoulders, neck or back, Starrett has a fix. “I want you to hang for three minutes a day,” he said. You can hang in many different ways, he said — by grabbing the edge of a sink or a doorframe or, better yet, a pull-up bar — just get your arms above your head and stretch a bit. Even the yoga pose “downward-facing dog” counts as hang time, he added. “That would fundamentally change your posture, change your neck pain, change your breath, change your shoulders, make it so you’re more durable. I mean, that is a foundational posture,” he said. “Go to the airport and watch people in the (body) scanner,” he said. “You’ll see why we have that as a test (in the book), because people literally … cannot put their arms over their head anymore.” Related article
      Civil rights icon Rosa Parks was a Yogi: ‘She was often taking care of herself’ Walk more (for a surprising reason) To keep stiffness at bay and maintain your mobility, Starrett advises everyone to do plenty of walking every day. “If I could give everyone in my family a pill that reduced all-cause mortality and morbidity by 51% — that’s walking 8,000 steps a day,” he said. “If you want your bones and tendons and ligaments and perceptive systems to work, you have to physically load them,” he said. “Right now, we’re seeing an epidemic of osteoporosis, osteopenia, sarcopenia — people are losing muscle, losing bone. That’s because this body is an adaptation machine, and if you stress it, it adapts, and if you don’t stress it, it adapts (in an undesirable way).” Walking loads our bones, our connective tissue, our tendons and our musculature. Additionally, walking helps the body decongest and clear waste, Starrett said. “Your body makes about 3 to 4 liters of lymphatic fluid every day,” he explained. “And the lymph system is the sewage system of the body: all of the broken-down cellular material, all of the waste, all the proteins that are too big to come in through your capillaries, all go out through your lymphatic system. “What we need to do is appreciate that that sewage system of the body has been bootstrapped through our muscle system,” he said. “And so, if we want to decongest, move the waste along, then we have to keep moving.” It also happens that as congested tissues get stiff, they don’t heal as well, he said. By decongesting our tissues, we get improved blood flow, which is also good for the brain. Related article
      ‘Exercise snacks’ — even a few minutes a day — can boost your health Play more Exercise doesn’t need to be all work. “We started to treat the health of the body as like some onerous task,” said Starrett, noting that play has been lost in our modern lives. “When’s the last time you did a sport or jumped into a dance class? “One of my favorite tools that I use even for my elite athletes (are videos by) Caleb Marshall, who is The Fitness Marshall,” he said. “We use (his free three-minute dance routines) to warm up, to have fun, to laugh. And what it does is it gets me moving in a novel way. It gets me interacting with my friends. It’s super fun.” Starrett also carries around a flying disc in his backpack so wherever he and his wife go, they can have spontaneous play during a moment of free time. “Play could be a continuum,” he said. “Going for a walk with your friends in the evening — I’m going to call it play. Exploring your neighborhood on a hike could be play. Humans are best when we’re playing. And that will solve a lot of movement problems.” Related article
      Adults may want to consider revisiting their childhood hobbies, according to a psychologist Don’t neglect the basics For robust physical movement, Starrett advised a balanced diet with enough protein and fruits and vegetables. Starrett recommended aiming for 800 grams of fruits and vegetables a day. “That could be frozen, that could be fresh, that could be beans, that could be potatoes, that could be fruits and vegetables — not just kale,” he said. “It’s about fiber and micronutrients. I need you to have all the vitamins and minerals on board so that you can have healthy tissues.” And he recommends at minimum getting 0.7 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight. “It’s about, ‘Hey, I want to have enough protein on board to be able to build muscle and build bone.’” And don’t forget sleep. “You’ve got to sleep,” Starrett said. “There’s not a single study in the world that says you can get by with less than seven hours of sleep. So, we look at seven as our sort of minimum threshold.” “When I work with people who are in chronic pain, who want to change their body composition, learn a skill, heal an injury, we start with their sleep,” he said.

"Editor’s note: Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.” If you’ve been hitting the gym regularly and feeling stronger — but also stiffer and more slouched — you may be overlooking key elements that create balance in your workouts. Despite good intentions, many people unknowingly reinforce poor posture with their strength-training workouts, leading to tight muscles, restricted mobility and even chronic pain. A few simple adjustments can help you train smarter so that your workouts boost your strength while improving your posture, leaving you moving better in and out of the gym. How workouts can hurt posture Your posture reflects how your body balances and supports itself during movement. Ideally, that balance includes a fluid alignment of your head, shoulders, spine and pelvis. Having poor posture — with slumped shoulders, a rounded back and a forward head position — stems from muscular imbalances, in which some muscles are overworked and tight while others are underused and weak. Unfortunately, many common practices in strength-training workouts can reinforce these imbalances. Related article
      Getting older doesn’t have to mean getting stiffer. 5 ways to keep mobile as you age Consider a training plan heavy on bench presses, push-ups and crunches. These moves all strengthen muscles on the front of your body, including the chest, abs and hip flexors, without addressing muscles on the back of your body that help support upright posture, such as the mid back, glutes and hamstrings. Over time, this imbalance can pull your body forward into a rounded, collapsed position. Even when your workouts are balanced, lifting with poor form, such as letting your shoulders hunch during rows or squats, can ingrain postural dysfunction. This issue becomes especially true when you perform the exercises repeatedly under load. How to train smarter, not stiffer The good news is you don’t have to give up your favorite exercises. Try making these three strategic adjustments to keep building strength in a way that also improves your posture and mobility. 1. Balance pushing and pulling exercises One of the simplest and most effective ways to support good posture through strength training is by creating balance in your workouts. For every pushing movement, such as push-ups or overhead presses, include a pulling movement such as rows or band pull-aparts. Pulling movements activate the muscles in your upper and middle back that help counteract the forward-pulling effect of dominant front-body muscles. If, like most people, the movements of your daily life include a lot of reaching, pushing and sitting, ideally, you should include more pulling than pushing exercises in your workouts. You also should balance lower body training to ensure that you are strengthening both the fronts and backs of your legs. Squats and lunges are great for your quads (upper front-leg muscles) and your glutes, but it’s also important to incorporate hinging movements, such as dead lifts and hip thrusts, which emphasize hamstring (upper back-leg muscles) strength.

      Stay motivated to work out by using mottos or mantras 2. Incorporate mobility exercises into your routine Mobility work is not just for warm-ups or recovery days — it’s a critical part of training to maintain healthy posture and keep you moving well. Tight muscles from strength training can limit your range of motion. Without mobility work, you may start compensating in ways that increase joint stress and postural strain. Add mobility drills that target commonly restricted areas, primarily the back, hips and shoulders. Even just five minutes of yoga or other intentional mobility work before or after your workout can reduce stiffness and enhance movement patterns. Related article
      Spend 5 minutes a day moving like this and you’ll move better for life Three of my go-to mobility exercises to include in strength-training programs are: • Wall slides to activate postural muscles in your mid back and counteract overactive muscles in your neck and chest. • Three-way hip flexor release to mobilize your hips and reduce lower back tension. • Windmill twist to promote thoracic and shoulder mobility while opening your chest, releasing low-back tension and stretching the backs of your legs. 3. Use proper form to reinforce good posture Form matters, especially when it comes to posture. Practicing proper alignment during workouts reinforces good movement patterns that carry over into daily life. That means paying attention to: • Head and neck position: Avoid jutting your chin forward or tensing your neck. • Shoulder positioning: Keep your shoulders down and back, not shrugged up toward your ears. • Spinal alignment: Maintain a neutral spine, avoiding excessive arching or rounding. • Breathing: Exhale during the effort phase of exercises (e.g., the pushing-up phase of a push-up) to support core engagement and help maintain stable posture.

      The best slip-on shoes for comfort and exercise, according to experts (Courtesy CNN Underscored) If you’re unsure about your form, consider working with a certified personal trainer or filming yourself to check alignment during exercises. Try not to rely solely on mirrors, which, as you crane your neck to see yourself, can sometimes encourage unnatural head positions that throw off your posture. Making these small changes to your workouts will deliver big benefits. By training smarter, you can more effectively build strength that supports good posture and healthy, pain-free movement.

"For many middle-aged and older people, getting a driver’s license was their first taste of long-awaited freedom –– and one they seized as soon as they could. But many of today’s teens are putting off this rite of passage, data shows. Nearly 40% of teens delayed getting their license by one to two years, and 30% delayed by more than two years, according to a 2020 study led by Dr. Federico Vaca, professor and executive vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at the University of California Irvine Medical School. Related article
      These are the biggest concerns facing teen boys and girls This continues a trend over the last 20 years: Between 2006 and 2015, the number of high school seniors with a driver’s license dropped from 81% to 72%, according to a 2017 study. It may seem mind-boggling to adults who have been driving for decades that anyone would delay such a milestone, but it makes sense given the economic and mental health concerns surrounding teens, Vaca added. Still, putting off getting a driver’s license may have impacts on teens safety as well as their development of independence, experts say. Here’s what parents need to know. Practical reasons why teens are waiting There are several factors contributing to teens being reluctant to start driving, and some are practical. It used to be that only kids in cities with public transportation like New York City and Washington DC could easily get around town. Now with the availability of rideshare apps, more teens can get where they need to go, said psychologist Dr. Lisa Damour, author of “The Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.” They’re also so busy with all the extra activities they think they need to get into college. A recent Pew survey found that most teens feel the pressure to get good grades and list academics as one of their biggest stressors. A lot of teenagers “are doing so much more work than you and I ever did in high school,” Damour added. Teens also socialize a lot online, she said, which means they don’t need to leave home to hang out with friends. Economics also plays a part. Parents and caregivers who need to spend more time working to keep the family afloat don’t have time to give driving lessons, Vaca said. “When we have an economic downturn, things kind of tighten up. People drive less. They travel in cars less,” he added. The mental health issues holding kids back Mental health concerns are common among today’s teens. Forty percent of students responded to the 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey said they experience persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness. That’s a big problem that often keeps teens from getting their license, said Dr. Rhonda Boyd, psychologist in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Boyd works with adolescents who have mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, and she has found that teens with mental health conditions often delay getting their driver’s licenses. Related article
      Self-hatred isn’t the same as depression. A psychiatrist explains how to treat it in teens Teens with depression usually have less energy and may isolate themselves and have trouble concentrating, which can impact them accomplishing goals, Boyd said. “Maybe just getting through school takes up so much of the time and energy that they have,” she said. “Extra things such as getting driver’s license or doing things that may lead to more independence are really harder.” When it comes to anxiety, teens may have fears and concerns about their next and more independent stage of life, so they may avoid those things that bring them there, Boyd added. Impacting their independence and safety Maybe it is a relief not to have your teen eager to get on the road, but it does come with some consequences, Vaca said. Being able to get around on their own –– which in many places means driving a car –– opens up other opportunities for teens to practice the things they will need to do in adulthood, he said. Those landmarks include getting summer jobs, getting themselves to sports or other extracurricular obligations, and managing their own health care appointments. “You’re not learning those experiences that you need to build on for later on,” Boyd said. There is also a safety element that becomes especially concerning when teens wait until they are adults to first learn to drive, Vaca said. The United States has a graduated driver’s license system, meaning there are rules, restrictions and educational requirements that taper off the more experience they have behind the wheel. First, a teen gets their permit and has to drive with an adult. Even when they get licensed, there is a period with measures to reduce risk such as not allowing night driving or limiting who they can have in their car when they drive, he added. “Driving is a really complex task. It’s a complex behavior, and we forget about that after we’ve been driving 10, 15, 20, 30 years,” Vaca said. For the most part, that easing into driving doesn’t apply when someone gets their license as an adult, he said. Still, while it is helpful to have your teen learn to drive under a graduated program and gain their independence behind the wheel in stages, younger isn’t always better, Vaca added. “There are developmental neuro-development pieces that are really important with executive decision-making,” he said. “These sorts of things, working memory and inhibitory control … are really important, and those things mature over time.” Should you make your kid get a license? Does this mean you should make your teen get a license even if they don’t want to? That doesn’t tend to work out well, Damour said. “The question becomes: who is it a problem for? Because if the family is tired of driving the kid around and wants to be relieved of carpool taxi duties, they’re certainly well within their rights to say, ‘we’re going ask you to do this,’” she said. If your teen would rather utilize a rideshare than get their own license, then the teen should be responsible for paying for it, Damour added. Related article
      No longer babies, some teens take to ‘soiling the nest’ But ideally, conversations about driving would start early with teens –– because they will be 15 or 16 before you know it, Vaca said. Families should have an eye on their child’s emotional maturity and development, he said. Are they responsible enough to get behind the wheel? Are they ready for the responsibility of driving? Also, be aware of the possibility that a delay in these milestones could be due to an untreated mental health condition and seek out resources for your teen if you think that may be the case, Boyd added.",,0.1969643533229828

After consulting with multiple specialists, she was diagnosed with labial hypoplasia, a condition in which her outer labia were only partially formed. Following surgery to correct the issue, she found significant relief and remained relatively pain-free, incorporating yoga into her routine to further support her healing. But the pain returned six years later, this time during the initial stages of penetration. The 33-year-old California resident has been fighting for three years to receive a formal diagnosis, as the root of her discomfort remains unclear. She requested only her first name be used out of privacy concerns. “I get a lot of ‘it’s probably anxiety or related to mental health,’” she said. “It’s disappointing since I made a ton of progress and now feel like I’m being tossed aside.” Nicole’s experience of painful sex isn’t unique. Nearly 3 in 4 women will experience painful intercourse at some point in their lives, whether it’s a temporary or long-term problem, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. “Sex should never be painful,” said Eva Dillon, a sex therapist based in New York City. “It’s something that women should never have to endure.” Related article
      An often overlooked way to improve your sex life in 2025 Painful intercourse can be caused by several common issues. Women who experience pelvic pain or pain with sexual activity, gynecological exams or tampon use may have tight pelvic floor muscles. The condition can increase tension and cause pain, according to Dr. Anna Falter, a physical therapist specializing in pelvic floor therapy at the Cleveland Clinic, via email. Pelvic pain can also be linked to tightness in other areas of the body, including the neck, lower back and hips — issues that might not immediately seem connected to sexual discomfort. Stress, previous surgeries, traumatic experiences or even unconscious muscle tensing can also contribute to this pain. Additionally, hormonal changes, such as decreased estrogen levels during menopause or postpartum, especially while breastfeeding, can lead to vaginal dryness, which can make intercourse uncomfortable or painful. For women experiencing pelvic floor muscle tension, pelvic floor physical therapy is often an effective treatment option to reduce pain and prevent muscles from becoming overly tight in the future, Falter said. One commonly used technique in pelvic floor physical therapy is trigger point therapy, which involves applying pressure to tight muscles to help them relax. A pelvic floor physical therapist may perform this method vaginally, using a gloved and lubricated finger to target and massage specific tight areas or trigger points, Falter said. Patients can also learn to perform self-trigger point release at home using their own fingers, a partner, a pelvic wand or vaginal dilators to help relax the internal muscles. Falter also noted that partners are welcome to attend pelvic floor therapy sessions, where they can learn strategies to support their partner if both parties are comfortable. Another approach is pelvic floor lengthening exercises, which differ from the more commonly known Kegel exercises, Falter explained. Lengthening involves relaxing the pelvic floor muscles, often paired with diaphragmatic breathing, where the patient inhales deeply, allowing their abdomen, rib cage and pelvic floor to relax. This movement is more challenging, so Falter recommends seeking help from a pelvic floor physical therapist to ensure you’re using the proper form. Related article
      Common vaginal condition is really an STD, study finds Falter also advises women to check in with their bodies throughout the day, especially during activities such as brushing their teeth or sitting on the couch, to check that they aren’t unconsciously tensing their pelvic muscles. Certain yoga poses and stretches, such as child’s pose, butterfly stretch and deep squat can help release pelvic tension. Still, it’s good to remember that seeking individualized treatment is always the best approach, Falter said. If your partner is experiencing pain during sex, there are steps you can take to provide comfort and support. Most importantly, if there’s any pain during intercourse, it’s crucial to stop immediately. Continuing despite discomfort can create negative associations between sex and pain, making future encounters even more challenging. “At the end of any sexual encounter, you want to be able to look forward to the next time with anticipation and delight,” Dillon said. “And, if sex is painful, you can begin to dread the next time, and it sets up a cycle, which you don’t want.” Communication is also key, and it’s important for both partners to be open and understanding about the pain and treatment journey, especially if shame or feelings of inadequacy arise. “It can be helpful if the partner takes time to learn about what their partner is experiencing, as well as the treatment strategies they are working on, so they can support and encourage them through the treatment journey,” Falter said.

      How to cultivate the ‘erotic thread’ that helps you stay connected to your romantic partner For couples who are temporarily unable to engage in intercourse, there are still many ways to stay connected physically. Dillon recommends trying outercourse — non-penetrative sexual activities like manual stimulation or oral sex — to maintain intimacy and pleasure. If intercourse or other forms of sexual activity are off the table, simple gestures such as a meaningful kiss or affectionate hugs can strengthen the emotional bond between partners. “These (forms of touch) are really important for us,” Dillon said. “They tell our nervous systems we’re safe and not alone.” Despite the lack of a clear diagnosis, Nicole has not given up on her desire for a fulfilling intimate relationship. Alongside her partner, she has taken matters into her own hands, exploring alternative solutions. “I tend to feel really frustrated with my body and the pain since I don’t want to have these issues,” Nicole said via email. “Physical intimacy can be such a huge part of a relationship, and sometimes I feel like I’m missing out.” Nicole and her boyfriend have found creative ways to maintain intimacy without intercourse or penetration. They have also incorporated pelvic floor therapies into their routine, which have helped alleviate some of the pain during their intimate moments. But that doesn’t mean she lives without disappointment. “There was a lot of education that had to be done, which can be not so fun and sexy when things are new,” she said.  “In the end it has really brought us closer together and created a more emotional intimate connection pretty early on since we had to have these less fun and pretty technical conversations.”",,0.38163477182388306
"As someone with autism, Madison Marilla would often feel left out as her neurotypical friends would get in relationships and go on dates in high school. At the time, she tried to invite some other friends with special needs to prom with her, but they said they were too shy to attend a big school event, she said. “This happened in high school quite a bit, because … emotionally, I was developmentally delayed, but not intellectually,” she said. “I did not understand the complex social skills involved in dating when I was in high school that most people my age understood at the time.” Watching Netflix’s reality show, “Love on the Spectrum,” inspired Marilla, now 27, to give dating another try. She is one of the participants on the US version of the series’ third season, which premiered on April 2 on Autism Awareness Day. About 1 in 36 children and 1 in 45 adults in the United States have autism, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Worldwide, about 1% of the population, or 75 million people, have received a diagnosis of autism, says the advocacy organization Autism Speaks. Autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is categorized by a range of symptoms, including various challenges with social communication and interaction, but many adults on the spectrum still desire to lead active social lives. Navigating the dating world as someone with autism was tricky for Marilla, and her first date on the show did not go as she had hoped. He was sensitive to noises at the restaurant where they went on their date, and they didn’t have many similar interests. Still, she didn’t give up after the one date and is now telling people that “finding love on the spectrum is possible.” During the process, Marilla learned how to find the balance of stepping outside one’s comfort zone, but not too far to where it could be disorienting for people both on and off the spectrum, said Jennifer Cook, the on-camera neurodiversity expert for the show, who also has an autism diagnosis. Cook often coaches neurodiverse people with a goal to have more connected lives and relationships, and helps them understand and identify hidden social rules. “It’s important for everybody to do things that are outside of their comfort zones, wherever you fall on the human spectrum,” Cook said. “It’s what makes us better and more creative and more fabulous individuals.” Here’s what Cook and several participants from the show shared about what it’s like going outside of the comfort zone for people on the spectrum, and their advice can apply to anyone trying to date in the 21st century. Learning zone vs. panic zone When Marilla was preparing for her first date, she met with Cook beforehand. She wanted to know things such as what she should talk about with her date, and whether she could bring items that make her comfortable — Marilla has an impressive collection of dolls and often brings a few along on outings. Marilla’s first date on the show might have been a good example of what Cook describes as the layers to stepping outside one’s comfort zone. Marilla, who had been on dates before and enjoys going out, was in what Cook calls the “learning zone.” “We’re in that midplace where we’re engaged, but we’re not unfocused, either by boredom or by panic. We’re feeling curious and interested in the people and places and things that are around us. We want to learn. We want to acquire new relationships and new skills,” Cook said. “It’s the Goldilocks thing.” But Marilla’s date, who had expressed on the show he was uncomfortable by the restaurant noise before the pair moved outside, was most likely in what Cook refers to as the “panic zone,” Marilla said. “That’s when you’re in a place of extreme feelings. So, you might feel confused, you might feel disoriented, insecure or even inept, like ‘I can’t do this,’” Cook said. “When we’re in that zone, we can’t take in any new information, we can’t think flexibly, we can’t communicate well with others.” That’s true for everyone, Cook noted. “This is not unique to autistic individuals.” When going outside the comfort zone, Cook often tells people on the spectrum who seek her advice to set goals that reflect what one can control. Even though Marilla didn’t find her first date to be a good match, she had still accomplished what she wanted to do, which was go on a date. Because she didn’t give up, Marilla went on another first date and found a better match. And yes, the pair was still going on dates after the show stopped filming, she said. Finding things in common Abbey Romeo, 26, who was diagnosed with autism at 2 years old, has been a participant of “Love on the Spectrum” since the show’s first season, during which she met her current boyfriend. They have been dating for nearly four years. During her first date, Romeo remembers feeling very nervous. “I felt like I was going to throw up because I had no memories connected with David (Isaacman, her boyfriend). We didn’t go to school together,” she said. “But I found out that we have a lot of things in common — not everything, but a lot of things.” When trying new things, what Romeo’s mom taught her helped a lot — speaking positively to herself when she is feeling nervous. “You could say, ‘Everything’s going to be OK. It’s totally normal to feel this way.’ And I also say, ‘I think I can. I think I can,’ just like the little engine that could, but instead, I’m the little engine that did,” Romeo said. The couple also “understand each other’s sensory needs,” Romeo said, which is important as “there are many different types of autism.” Sometimes, they each need breaks from each other or the world, which can involve going on their phones or taking a moment to be alone in another room. While Romeo and her boyfriend have a lot in common, such as their love for animals, particularly lions, they also have different interests that they have shown to one another, such as different foods to try and places to see.

      For adults, autism diagnosis can unlock a new life Learning another person’s perspective Cook often gets asked about the challenge of hearing and understanding someone else’s perspective. While not specific to those with autism, it is often a challenge shared by people on the spectrum. “That’s where you get the misunderstanding that autistic people are unempathetic,” Cook said. “That could not be more wrong.” It is called the “theory of mind,” which is the ability to understand and attribute other people’s thoughts and emotions, and can be difficult for autistic people to do without being taught or having previously experienced the other person’s perspective, Cook said. There is also the challenge of anticipating what someone will say and then naturally responding to it in real time. Related article
      Experts tell parents how to help their kids through their anxiety Cook’s advice, for those on the spectrum or not, is to be authentic. It is OK to acknowledge the awkward silence of a date, or to bring a small doll or two if that will help someone feel more confident in stepping outside of their comfort zone, she said. For those looking to support someone in their life who is autistic and wants to step into their learning zone, Cook suggests teaching and practicing coping skills with that person. Her favorite is a method that uses all five senses and helps someone slow down when in anxiety-inducing situations: “Identify five things that you can see, four things that you can hear, three things you can feel, two you can taste and one you can smell.” As people who are both on the spectrum, Romeo and Marilla agree that it is important to step out of your comfort zone, even if it can be scary. Marilla’s friend gave her this advice, which she shared: “Life is at its best when you’re outside your comfort zone, and it’s best to let yourself out, not hold yourself in,” she said. “And those are very true words I stick to this day, and they have helped me with the dating process.” Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.",,0.22055202722549438
"Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life. Nearly 70% of all food in grocery stores in the United States is ultraprocessed, meaning the foods contain additives used to add flavor and color, create texture, extend shelf life and keep ingredients from separating. Yet little research on the health impact of additives exist, and what data there is looks at the possible harms of individual ingredients, such as food dyes and brominated vegetable oil, as well as contaminants that leach into foods from packaging. However, clusters of additives often used by industry in certain food categories may be more harmful when eaten together than alone, according to a new study which found two such mixtures linked to a small but significant increase in type 2 diabetes. “The research shows that the intake of certain clusters of additives increases the risk of diabetes beyond the effect of each individual additive,” said Carlos Augusto Monteiro, emeritus professor in the school of public health at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, in an email. “The fact that the regulation of additives considers their effect on health individually, rather than as part of a combination, has been criticized because these additives are consumed in clusters, not alone,” Monteiro said. “The research demonstrates that this criticism is absolutely valid.” Monteiro, who was not involved in the study, created the often-used NOVA classification system, which groups food by levels of processing. Foods in their natural state, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs, are considered unprocessed or minimally processed. Related article
      Ultraprocessed foods make up to 70% of the US food supply. How to reduce your intake Salts, oils and spices are processed cooking ingredients. Canned vegetables and fruits, breads and cheese are considered processed. Packaged and ready-to-eat foods, processed meats and sugary and diet drinks that contain additives never or rarely used in kitchens and that undergo extensive industrial processing are considered ultraprocessed. The International Council of Beverages Associations, which represents industry, told CNN via email the study was “absurd.” “This study’s claim is highly misleading and only serves to instill fear and confusion among consumers. Decades of robust scientific evidence show these ingredients are safe,” said ICBA Executive Director Kate Loatman. Additives often used in ultraprocessed foods include preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; fragrance and flavor enhancers; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food more appealing. Industry often combines the same additives over and over in a particular type of food because they have complementary properties, said senior study author Mathilde Touvier, director of the Nutritional EpidemiologyResearch Team at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research, a public research organization.

      Certain foods may disrupt your body’s fight against cancer cells, study says “A diet soda will contain a mixture of artificial sweeteners, dyes, and acidifiers such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), sulfite ammonia caramel, and citric acid,” said Touvier via email. “Same for a flavored diet yogurt — with emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners — or an industrial bread with emulsifiers, preservatives, etc.” In addition, people often eat certain foods together, thus creating unique groups of additives, said Touvier, who is also the principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé cohort, a long-term study of the relationship between nutrition and health. Take a regular fast-food consumer who eats a typical meal of a burger on an industrial bun, fries and a soda, or a hot dog on industrial bread with chips and soda. Eating the same ultraprocessed foods together on a regular basis can contribute to creating these clusters of chemicals, she said. The new research, published Tuesday in PLOS Medicine, analyzed nutritional and health data of over 108,000 adults participating in the French NutriNet-Santé study. Prior studies using this population uncovered an association between artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers such as polysorbate 80, carrageenan, xanthan and guar gum, and the nitrates found in processed meats with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Participants were asked about their dietary intake by brand at the start of the study by using the Open Food Facts database, a listing of the ingredients, allergens and nutrition facts of over 3 million foods from 150 countries by commercial brand name. Knowing the nutritional and ingredient list for each food allowed the researchers to build a database of known additives eaten by each person. Related article
      They’re up to 70% of the American diet. But the US has no policy on ultraprocessed foods “These mixtures are data-driven,” said first study author Marie Payen de la Garanderie, a doctoral student in the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research. “We did not decide ‘a priori’ to group additives together. These 5 mixtures reflect the ones most frequently ingested by NutriNet-Santé participants,” de la Garanderie said in an email. “This study is the first to estimate exposure to food additive mixtures in a large cohort of the general population and to analyze their link to the incidence of type 2 diabetes.” Nutritional data was then compared to medical records through December 2023 to see who developed type 2 diabetes. “We carefully adjusted all models for intakes of energy, added sugars, saturated fatty acids, sodium, dietary fiber, etc., in order to isolate a potential effect of the studied mixtures, independently from the well-known effect of sugar on type 2 diabetes,” Touvier said. Of the five clusters of additives, two were associated with a modest increase in a risk for diabetes, regardless of the nutritional quality of the diet, or sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.

      ‘This disorder has almost killed me’: His addiction to ultraprocessed food began as a child The first cluster consisted of modified starches, pectin, guar gum, carrageenan, polyphosphates, potassium sorbates, curcumin and xanthan gum. Xanthan and guar gum are derived from plants and are typically safe, even beneficial, according to some studies. However, other studies have found disruptions in gut microbiota and inflammation. Foods in this cluster would include creamy dairy desserts, such as ready-to-eat puddings, fat-based sauces such as cheese dip, and broths. “Modified starches is a group of phosphate additives,” said Elizabeth Dunford, an adjunct assistant professor in the department of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who was not involved in the study. “There is a plethora of research to show the detrimental effect phosphate intake has on kidney function, and it is most certainly linked to negative effects in type 2 diabetes,” Dunford said in an email. The second cluster linked to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes included citric acid, sodium citrates, phosphoric acid, sulfite ammonia caramel, acesulfame potassium or Ace-K, aspartame, sucralose, Arabic gum, malic acid, carnauba wax, paprika extract, anthocyanins, guar gum and pectin. These additives are typically found in sugary and artificially sweetened drinks. Related article
      Adding just a few ultraprocessed foods to a healthy diet raised risk of cognitive decline and stroke, study says “One of the clusters contains several emulsifiers, while the other contains several non-sugar sweeteners — both groups with individual components whose association with diabetes was already demonstrated, so findings are very consistent,” Monteiro said. Much more research needs to be done to gain a “deeper understanding” of potential interactions of food additive mixtures on metabolism, de la Garanderie said. “The research appears thorough,” Dunford said. “I think this paper is a good first step to highlighting the potential negative health consequences of specific additive combinations.”",,0.17004618048667908

For many parents, the idea of having “the talk” with their kids may be daunting, making them feel embarrassed or squeamish. But many parents are conflating the classic growing-up talk about sex with another crucial conversation they should be having, new research suggests. The talk in question should happen earlier than one may think, and it’s not necessarily about sex. It’s about puberty. About 41% of parents reported they approached talking with their child about puberty only when prompted by the child, according to a new C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children’s Health released on Monday. Only 36% of parents think it’s best to start puberty conversations before age 10, according to the poll, although puberty has been starting earlier. Related article
      Puberty is starting earlier. Should parents worry? 5 things to know from a pediatrician The poll’s researchers focused on why many preteens and tweens are unprepared for the changes that they experience during puberty. “Our thinking was, how much of that (lack of preparation) might be due to how their parents are approaching the task of talking with them, helping prepare them for puberty,” said Sarah Clark, codirector of the poll and a research scientist in the department of pediatrics at the University of Michigan ﻿in Ann Arbor. “When we’re talking about these younger kids, 7, 8, 9, maybe even 10, as they’re just getting started with puberty, they don’t necessarily need the sex talk,” said Clark, noting that tweens and teens need a conversation about what is or will soon happen with their body and emotions. “We all tend to be a little calmer, a little less anxious, and deal with things better when we know what to expect,” she added. The Mott Poll, which was conducted in February 2025, surveyed 911 parents with at least one child ages 7–12 to understand how parents approach conversations about puberty. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 to 5 percentage points. Bring it up before your child does While many parents said they only talked with their child about puberty only when their child brought it up, Clark explained that this could lead to confusion and anxiety in children, especially if they feel their parents haven’t prepared them. Kids who develop early may become anxious not understanding changes in themselves, and ﻿late-developing kids ﻿may see some changes in their classmates and wonder, “what’s wrong with me?” Instead of parents waiting until asked by the child, Clark suggested giving your child information in bits and pieces over time “to help your kid get the concept that these changes are going to happen. They are normal.” And while nearly half of parents said they felt “very confident” in recognizing signs of puberty in their children, Clark said, “parents might be a little overconfident. Some of those first changes are subtle” — like hair growing and voices changing — and parents can’t actually see the hormonal or emotional changes. Related article
      Empathy is on the rise in young people. Here’s how to build yours Will you or the media educate your kids? Today’s children are exposed to a flood of information — and misinformation — from online sources and their peers. Without parental guidance, children may turn to social media or their peers for answers at a time when kids may be confused and potentially self-conscious. “Not talking to them just can leave them in a little bit of a vulnerable position,” Clark said. “A lot of the norms on what was shown or talked about on TV were really different (when parents were kids) than they are today,” Clark said. “Back then, parents could maybe feel like they could protect their kid or avoid certain topics — or avoid their kid from encountering certain topics.” That’s no longer the case. Because kids can learn or hear about all sorts of topics at very young ages, parents have to be “a little more proactive,” to get ahead of the child absorbing confusing, inaccurate or harmful information, Clark said. The trickle-down effect of silence The poll found that only 31% of parents said they had received an adequate puberty education from their own parents growing up. That means many parents, without a model of how to discuss sensitive developmental changes, often default to the avoidance method they received as children. But today’s parents don’t actually need to have all the answers, Clark and other experts say. Parents just need to start having the conversation. Start talking sooner and more often About 44% of parents reported in the poll that they have not gotten any information on how to talk about puberty, but that doesn’t mean parents can’t find straightforward help. Parents should choose a quiet, one-on-one setting — a walk, a car ride or after a younger sibling goes to bed — and leave discomfort out of it, psychiatrist Dr. Neha Chaudhary suggested. “Present the information in a matter-of-fact way,” advised Chaudhary, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and chief medical officer at Modern Health, via email. “It’s important that the child knows they are not alone in this experience — that it’s a universal change. Offer the space for them to ask questions … and check in later.” Don’t wait until your child hits a growth spurt or need to use deodorant. Begin the conversation in elementary school, with basic, age-appropriate information. Related article
      Teens are delaying getting their driver’s licenses. Parents want to know why You can use light-hearted, teachable moments, like a movie scene or a health class unit as openings, or you can share your own experiences. “Make it kind of funny and not so intense, not so scary,” Clark suggested. “If you talk about puberty early, your child will know that the physical changes they are about to go through are normal, and something that happens to everyone,” Chaudhary said. “They might also have a chance to develop some healthy coping skills that they can practice and strengthen before their emotions start to fluctuate as a result of hormonal shifts. “If you’re waiting until middle school, it’s likely too late. By then your child might either be caught off guard by unexpected changes in their body or how they feel, or they might be noticing those changes in their friends already.” Open the door to talking Healthy, inviting communication needs to be ongoing, both Clark and Chaudhary emphasized. Kids should not be left guessing about the changes happening to them, but rather feel they have parental guidance supporting them along the way. “You want to leave the door open so kids know they can come to you,” she said. Even if you don’t know the answer, you can learn together and foster a healthy environment.",,0.16108448803424835
"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being. The importance of female friendships is often in the spotlight. But when it comes to the ties that bind men, research has shown that less than half of men report being satisfied with their friendships. A decline in male friendships often starts around middle to late adolescence and deepens into adulthood. Kim Evensen, the Norwegian-born founder of Brothers — a nonprofit organization created to help empower men’s friendships — had an epiphany about what was missing from his own friendships with other men when he was 25. “I saw these rules that we as men often feel we have to follow,” said Evensen, who is based in Oslo, the Norwegian capital. “Like ‘boys don’t cry,’ we don’t express vulnerability toward each other, we don’t get too close to each other.” Evensen found himself tired of the meaningless hangouts with other men he realized had dominated his friendships, such as grabbing a beer together or being a workout buddy. “It has to be something more, because if I settled for what popular culture sets as the standard for male friendships, then I, as a man, won’t have a lot of meaningful friendships,” he said. Evensen turned to experts on male friendships, including Dr. Niobe Way, a researcher and a professor of applied psychology at New York University, to seek guidance on how to strengthen and understand his own bonds with his male friends — and how to help other men, too. In 2017, he founded Brothers, turning what had started out as an Instagram account into a full-time career. Evensen has written two books on the topic of male friendships — “Brothers: Every Man Needs Strong, Authentic Friendships” and “The Real Bro Code: The Essential Guide for Dudes on How to Be a Bro ” — and he’s traveled to Australia, the United States, Kenya and beyond to speak about men’s friendships and masculinity.

      Ashton Hall’s ‘morning routine’ highlights the pressures men face today At his lectures, Evensen asks men about how they want their friendships to look and about the closest moments they’ve shared with their male friends. “I really want men to develop closer and deeper friendships — just saying that — I get a lot of funny reactions,” he said. I talked to him about the roadblocks men face in their friendships with other men — and how to move past them. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: You say the first roadblock to deep male friendships stems from a taboo of even discussing them. How can men get past that? Kim Evensen: You have to push through the awkwardness and acknowledge your friendships. I learned from Dr. Niobe Way that most adolescent boys express a deep affection and love for their close male friends in private interviews. But when their statements are read out loud to larger groups of teenage boys, the boys start laughing and calling it weird or girlish or gay. Related article
      These are the biggest concerns facing teen boys and girls Talking about your friendship with another man might mean pushing through some awkwardness. But think of it this way: If you want to get muscles, you’re going to have to work out. And if you want to have good friendships, you have to work for it. Mention the elephant in the room, say, “Hey, I really appreciate and value you, and I feel like I don’t say it enough. And I want to invest more in our friendship.” That’s a good place to start. CNN: You talk about how society has dumbed down male friendships. How does that affect those bonds? Evensen: If men settle for popular culture’s standards of male bonding, they won’t have a lot of meaningful connections. It’s generally assumed that male friendships are supposed to be easygoing and emotionally risk-free. Low-maintenance hangouts, with little or no commitment. So how do you try to cultivate something deeper? Friendships are like relationships. They’re always about two people. A lot of guys only hang out in groups. If that’s you, try hanging out or grabbing a beer with just one of your friends. If you always hang out in groups, you never get to really know the people around you and create a friendship just between the two of you. Point to this article, even, so you have something to discuss other than yourself. Open up yourself. If you do, your friend will see it as a sign of trust. If you are the one to start, maybe he’ll open up to you, too. Related article
      The male loneliness epidemic and how it affects fathers CNN: How does a narrow-minded view of masculinity affect male friendships? Evensen: The psychiatrist and family therapist Dr. Robert Garfield wrote a book called “Breaking the Male Code: Unlocking the Power of Friendship” that really resonated with me. It’s about how a lot of men are bound by this unwritten rule that they should only express manly emotions. But emotional intimacy is a human trait that’s necessary to create close friendships. We have this idea that a real man should think about sex all the time and use women as a currency to prove to the boys that he’s a man — and, by all means, avoid expressing any of the so-called opposite qualities like joy, compassion, empathy, love and vulnerability. Especially not in front of other men. Ask yourself, do you think your friend would value it if you would express empathy or compassion toward them? Some men will say, “We don’t need this, or we’re not like that. Don’t try to turn us into a woman.” But you have to try to demolish that argument. Friendships built on insecurity, where men constantly have to prove their manhood, are a breeding ground for toxic attitudes and stupid decision-making. Related article
      Strong, steady friendships may be an asset to your physiological health, study shows CNN: You say that the sexualization of love has impacted male friendships. How so? Evensen: So many boys and men avoid closeness or affection in their friendships just to make sure nothing will be misunderstood, that they won’t be called gay. An intimate conversation, a heartfelt encouragement or a hug without a firm pat on the back might create suspicion, so you better play it safe. The words “love” and “sex” have been used interchangeably. And without being aware of it, we have formed perceptions about love and closeness that aren’t true. It kills closeness in male friendships. I’ve asked myself why do we say things like “I love you bro, no homo.” I’ve never heard a 3-year-old boy say that to his friend, or girls say that to their girlfriends. Maybe start a conversation with your friend about why men even say those things?

What can be done about that? Evensen: It’s so common that many of us have just accepted it as a way of life — as a legitimate way to neglect our friendships. And it kind of makes sense. After all, why prioritize a bunch of shallow hangouts when you can invest in a relationship with someone you’re allowed to deeply connect with? We need to be able to value romantic relationships without neglecting friendships and vice versa. Would you appreciate it if your friend ditched you for a girl? Probably you wouldn’t, so don’t do that to your friend either. Make sure your friend gets to know your girlfriend since she’s going to be part of your life. Related article

"The world may feel cold, scary and cruel, but if you are open to seeing it, there is a lot of kindness, according to a new report. The World Happiness Report, released each year on the International Day of Happiness, is a global analysis on happiness and well-being in partnership with Gallup, the University of Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre and the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network. This year’s report paid special attention to acts of benevolence and people’s expectations of their communities. What are acts of benevolence? The report divided them into three categories: donating money, volunteering and doing a nice thing for a stranger. Related article
      At the end of the day, don’t we all want to be happy? Here are 5 ways to get there Based on the data, 70% of the world’s population did at least one kind thing in the last month, the report found. “That’s a really, really high number,” said Dr. Felix Cheung, the report’s coauthor and assistant professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and Canada Research Chair in Population Well-Being. “We should just look at that number and feel really good. Seven in 10 people around us have done something nice … in the past month.” This trend of doing kind things is down from a spike during the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is still an improvement from pre-lockdown numbers, according to the report. “Even though the world feels like it’s a pretty difficult place right now, it is nice to know that people are engaging in kind and generous acts,” said Dr. Lara Aknin, professor of social psychology at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia and an editor of the World Happiness Report. There is evidence that doing nice things helps both the recipient and the doer feel happier, and benevolence may be a key step to improving your own happiness and the overall happiness in the United States, which continues to drop on the list of happiest countries, said Ilana Ron-Levey, a managing director of the public sector at Gallup. (The US ranked No. 24 on this year’s list of the happiest countries.) Making a donation, doing an hour of volunteer work or engaging in some other small act of kindness may seem insignificant in the list of big things that make a happy life, but the data says otherwise, according to Ron-Levey. “Acts of generosity predict happiness even more than earning a higher salary,” she said. Aknin has studied the impact of benevolence and found that it’s significant. One experiment recruited a sample of participants on university campuses to report their baseline happiness. Researchers then gave them a small amount of money –– about $2 to $5 –– and told them to spend it on themselves or someone else, she said. “Then we measure people’s immediate emotional reactions,” Aknin said. “By and large, we find in almost all of our studies that people randomly assigned to spend generously report feeling higher levels of happiness than people who spend on themselves.” The pattern was similar in other countries such as South Africa, Uganda and India. “We’re a super social species,” Aknin said, “and we argue that acts of generosity help build and sustain those connections.” Given the number of people who do kind things, expectations of benevolence are generally low, Aknin said. “Long story short is that people are overly pessimistic,” she said. To understand how people perceive the levels of kindness around them, researchers for the survey asked if people expected a lost wallet to be returned to them, Cheung said. The researchers broke the survey down by seeing if people expected a neighbor, the police or a stranger would return the wallet. “The US ranks 17th in the world in believing a neighbor would return a lost wallet, 25th in the world in believing the same of police, but ranks only 52nd in believing that a stranger would return a wallet, which really suggests some fraying of social cohesion,” Ron-Levey said. People were more likely to believe that a neighbor or police officer would return a lost wallet if found, but belief in a stranger is a barometer of trust, Aknin said. “The stranger returning a lost wallet is really, really important in terms of that trust in your society,” she said. And researchers have been able to compare the expectations with reality. In previous studies, researchers have gone to different cities around the globe, dropped wallets and analyzed the rates of the wallets being returned against what the people in that city reported they believed would happen, Aknin said. Almost every place drastically underestimated the likelihood of the wallet being returned by a stranger, she said. The disparity is called an “empathy gap,” Aknin added. For example, about one-third of people expected a lost wallet to be returned in the US, whereas two-thirds of such wallets actually were, Cheung said. It makes sense that a bigger empathy gap would have a negative impact on happiness, Aknin added. “If we assume the worst of others, it shapes how we interact with the world,” Aknin said. “If we expect the worst of others, we walk around the world fearful, and that matters for our own well-being.” The good news is that the empathy gap can be closed, Aknin said. “We’re not asking people to have unreasonably optimistic (expectations),” Cheung said. But ifyou can “develop that trust and you can expect that level of kindness, you will be a lot happier.” The report shows that people’s perceptions of the kindness of others has improved when they take social risks, Aknin said. “When they do, they realize that most of these risks are met with kindness and positivity,” she said. Aknin’s research has also showed the best ways to perform benevolent acts to get the boost of happiness. She calls it the three C’s. In your kind acts, you should connect with others, Aknin said. For example, you are more likely to get a bigger boost taking someone out for coffee rather than sending a person $5 to get coffee on their own, she said. “Social time is pretty critical, or that face-to-face connection can go a long way,” Aknin added. The second C is for choice, meaning it feels better when you act in a kind or generous way because you want to, not because you feel obligated to do so, she said. Related article
      People are lonely. Small steps in your community can make a difference The last is for a clear sense of positive impact. Doing something you can see the impact of or donating to a cause that you can see the benefit of is likely to give you the most fulfillment, Aknin said. One other metric that may tell part of the story regarding the connection between kindness and happiness is the rate of people eating alone, Ron-Levey said. “Even when accounting for household size, eating alone is linked to lower lifestyle satisfaction,” she said. And meal sharing has been going down: One in 4 Americans reported eating all their meals alone the previous day –– which is a 53% increase since 2003, Ron-Levey said. “These things are all connected,” she added. “If you’re eating by yourself most of the time, if you don’t have someone that you can rely on in a time of need, if you’re losing trust in institutions and your community, it’s going to lead most likely to fewer benevolent acts, which, in turn, affects your happiness.” Those factors add up to isolation and lack of social connections, which can affect your happiness, Ron-Levey said. But that lack of community isn’t true everywhere. A sense of community and social connection is “one of the most important explanations of why Finland and the Nordic countries remain at the top of the happiness rankings year over year,” she added.

"Editor’s note: CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta and writer Sandee LaMotte are part of the study covered in this story and have written about their experiences. When Penny Ashford’s father was diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease at age 62, she knew the devastating brain disorder might one day steal her memory. In her late 50s, her free-floating anxiety turned to outright panic when she began struggling to find words. “I couldn’t tell a story. I couldn’t get my words out,” said Ashford, now 61. “I remember sitting at a dinner party one time, and I couldn’t finish my thoughts. It was the most unbelievable moment. “I came home and sobbed and told my husband, ‘Something is wrong with me. I can’t talk,’” she said. “I was petrified.” Today, after a complete revamp of her lifestyle and overall health, Ashford’s struggles with retrieving words have eased, while measures of amyloid and tau proteins and neuroinflammation — all hallmark signs of Alzheimer’s — have fallen. Ashford knows about these improvements because she’s part of a unique study tracking her progress via key blood biomarkers now being used to help diagnose early dementia. Instead of relying on painful spinal taps and expensive brain scans, these blood tests are heralded as a new, less invasive and time-consuming way to determine risk and aid in an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. The preliminary data, presented Monday at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in San Diego, analyzed biomarkers on 54 participants in an ongoing preventive neurology study called the Biorepository Study for Neurodegenerative Diseases, or BioRAND. “The field is primarily using various biomarkers to determine if you have dementia or not,” said lead study author Dr. Kellyann Niotis, a preventive neurologist who researches risk reduction for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. “No one is really looking at the changes in these biomarkers as outcome measures, as a way of tracking progress in a person’s journey to improve their brain,” Niotis said. “We believe these biomarkers may show how the disease progression is being modified biologically by a person’s actions.” Alzheimer’s blood tests are the key to widespread prevention of dementia, experts say. If people can be diagnosed in their doctor’s office, they can more immediately move into preventive care and implement lifestyle changes designed to slow the progression of their disease. The problem, said senior study author Dr. Richard Isaacson, is the variability in how well these new blood biomarker tests work to predict or track disease progression. Related article
      New blood test that screens for Alzheimer’s may be a step closer to reality, study suggests “There is a dirty little secret in the Alzheimer’s blood testing community where so many testing platforms, biotech companies, and a flurry of new blood tests are released,” Isaacson said, “but it’s unclear which of these tests are most accurate to track progression and evaluate response to therapies to slow progression toward dementia.” To address this gap, Isaacson’s research team and collaborators at five sites across the United States and Canada set forth to evaluate and eventually cross-compare the clinical use of what the neurologist said he believes will one day become “the cholesterol test for the brain.” “In the not so far future, people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond will get a baseline test to evaluate risk and help track progress over time — similar to how traditional cholesterol tests are used today,” said Isaacson, founder of one of the first Alzheimer’s prevention clinics in the United States. “Our eventual goal is to offer a blood panel at cost to help democratize access and broaden the ability for people to receive care,” he added. Measuring levels of both amyloid and tau is key to understanding and diagnosing Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Amyloid plaques play a key role in the development of Alzheimer’s when small clusters gather at synapses in the brain and interfere with the nerve cells’ ability to communicate. Such plaques are thought to trigger changes in tau proteins, which form into tangles in parts of the brain controlling memory. Tau tangles are also implicated in other neurological diseases such as frontal lobe dementia, or FTD, and Lewy body dementia in which abnormal clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the brain’s neurons.

      How much longer you might live without assistance on new Alzheimer’s drugs The biomarker plasma phosphorylated tau 217, or p-tau217 for short, is a top contender in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. Its cousin, p-tau 181, is also a helpful indicator. P-tau 217 is a “beautiful marker for Alzheimer’s,” Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Association, told CNN in an earlier interview. “You’re not really measuring amyloid, but the test is telling you it’s there, and that’s been backed up with objective PET (positron emission tomography) scans that can see amyloid in the brain,” Carrillo said. “… If you have elevated tau in your brain, however, then we know that’s a sign of another type of dementia.” Another biomarker test is the amyloid 42/40 ratio scan, which measures two types of amyloid proteins, another key biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease. At times, such tests work best when used together. In an earlier study, a combination of both amyloid and p-tau 217 tests, called the amyloid probability score, showed a 90% accuracy rate in determining whether memory loss is due to Alzheimer’s disease.

      ‘A study to give us hope’: Lifestyle changes improve Alzheimer’s symptoms for some Glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, and neurofilament light chain, or NfL, which indicate brain inflammation and degenerative decay, are also helpful in tracking the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Dozens more biomarkers are being tested in labs around the world. Isaacson’s team at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases is studying more than 125 individual markers from a variety of commercial and research-based tests, some of which may soon be available in a clinical setting. Why investigate so many? Because personalized medicine may demand it, Niotis said. “Neurodegenerative diseases present so differently in different people,” she said. “It may be we will need a very nuanced, individualized approach in clinical practice to monitor the effectiveness of what we’re doing for a given patient.” The ongoing preventive neurology study called BioRAND reported on 71 participants, with   biomarkers being analyzed on 54 people. The other 17 people served as the control group. The group of 54 received a series of personalized lifestyle recommendations designed to improve their brain. Such interventions have been shown in past research to improve memory and thinking skills by five points on a cognitive test for people with mild cognitive impairment. Related article
      Signs of Alzheimer’s were everywhere. Then his brain improved The recommendations include a focus on blood pressure control, diet, exercise, stress reduction, sleep hygiene and weight control as well as addressing metabolic, hormonal and nutrient imbalances. Medications, vitamins and supplements are tailored to each person’s unique needs. Similar to a 2019 study led by Isaacson and Niotis, people who fulfilled at least 60% of the lifestyle recommendations were considered high compliance, while those who implemented less than 60% were low compliance. Periodic blood tests tracked progress in various brain biomarkers. The outcome? The more work people put into change, the better their brains. Just look at Penny Ashford. “My blood work was terrible; my eating habits were terrible. I didn’t exercise, so my muscle tone was really bad — I had no muscles in my bottom or on my thighs,” Ashford said. “I got the lecture of a lifetime,” she said. “They told me, ‘Your window is closing, your markers are so bad. Either you’ve got to do this, or you’re done.’” A lifelong sugar addict, Ashford stopped eating sweets. “I used to think I had a chemical imbalance because I was such a crazy freak about sugar — I could polish off a whole bag of Oreos, no problem, and I love ice cream,” Ashford said. “I haven’t had a dessert. I haven’t had ice cream. I haven’t had anything except fruit since a year ago March.” She began an intense exercise program of cardio and resistance training, along with yoga for stress reduction, and moved to a plant-based Mediterranean style of eating. Under a doctor’s supervision, she added supplements and vitamins to boost energy and lower stress. “She was a 10 out of 10 with her diet and exercise,” Niotis said. “She lost around 30 pounds and gained lean muscle mass. It was amazing.” A year later, Ashford’s blood biomarkers told a completely different story about her brain health. Her p-tau 217 dropped by 43% and her p-tau 181 by 75%. Related article
      Belly fat linked to signs of Alzheimer’s 20 years before symptoms begin, study says “We also looked at GFAP and neurofilament light, the markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration,” Niotis said. “Penny’s GFAP went down by 66% and her NfL went down by 84%. “These are really impressive changes in these markers of neuronal health,” she said. “And the best part about it is it really did track with her clinical symptoms. Her word retrieval problems improved, and she felt so much better.” Ashford wasn’t the only top performer in the study. Blood biomarkers also significantly improved across the entire group given risk reduction advice, Isaacson said, even those who were not as committed as Ashford. “I’ve lost count on how many people have shown blood markers of brain disease trend in the right direction, but every time it amazes me,” he said. “For over 20 years, I was told that what is happening right in front of my eyes was impossible, but the patients’ stories, clinical improvements and test results speak for themselves.” Much more work remains before blood testing for Alzheimer’s becomes a routine part of clinical practice, Isaacson said. “Our group has a saying, ‘Promise not to overpromise.’ By this we mean it’s critical to be transparent about the current limitations of these tests, and the variability across different platforms,” he said.

And each success that I have empowers me to do more, keep going and not let up. “I look back at my dad. He didn’t have any of these options.

      Therapy is more than lying on a couch and talking. Here are 5 ways it can boost happiness So-called bibliotherapy can be a powerful wellness practice, according to Emely Rumble, a Springfield, Massachusetts-based licensed clinical social worker who has been prescribing it to her clients for 15 years. For most of us, “there’s not really too many opportunities to slow down and turn inward,” said Rumble, who teaches a course on bibliotherapy at Queens College in New York City. She is also author of “Bibliotherapy in the Bronx,” a book to be published in April. Reading offers a break from work and caring for other people, she said, and it can also be a way to gain personal insights. Books often have powerful effects on people, making readers cry or causing them to get angry. “If an emotion comes up for you while you’re reading, there’s some information there for you,” Rumble said. If readers stop and think about what’s making them have the reactions they’re experiencing, they can gain valuable knowledge about themselves. Similarly, she said, if readers find themselves connecting emotionally with certain characters, they should consider what’s making them attach to those individuals. Rumble recommended readers keep journals on hand to write down what they learn about themselves. Reading about and reflecting on a topic also can provide an opportunity to see things from other people’s points of view and even to reconsider your beliefs, Rumble said. “We can realize that, OK, maybe I am thinking about something in black-and-white terms. Or maybe I am catastrophizing a little bit too much,” she said. “Sometimes we read something (to help) reframe our perspective.” Rumble said stories also remind readers that they’re not the only ones who are suffering. “We’re all impacted by the same societal ills, maybe on different levels, in different ways,” she said. This realization can help people feel less alone. Related article

What matters is that it’s enjoyable for the person. While some people like me find reading to be a way to relax and gain insights on our own, Rumble said therapists also prescribe books to their patients as a form of learning and healing. “Traditional talk therapy, having a therapist ask you very personal questions or details about traumatic experiences, can feel really harrowing,” she said. “When you’re looking at it through the lens of a fictional character,” she said, “it becomes a lot easier to talk about some of those painful memories or to consider different experiences that you’ve had.” Related article

As a college professor, I find that, overall, my students read less now than they did when I started teaching a decade ago. But Rumble advised that it’s best not to set goals for how many books you’ll get through in a week or a year. Once we start focusing on how much we’re reading, “we take the joy away from the benefits of slowing down,” she said. Related article

When I want to escape to Italy, I love soaking in Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels and Jo Piazza’s “The Sicilian Inheritance.” Reading Donna Tartt’s “The Goldfinch” recently reminded me of the power of art and prompted me to take my young daughters to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they were mesmerized by artifacts from ancient Egypt.

With the first generation of people exposed widely to technology now approaching old age, how has its use affected their risk of cognitive decline? That’s a question researchers from two Texas universities sought to answer in a new meta-analysis study, a review of previous studies, published Monday in the journal Nature Human Behavior. The query investigates the “digital dementia hypothesis,” which argues that lifetime use may increase reliance on technology and weaken cognitive abilities over time. “We say a really active brain in youth and midlife is a brain that is more resilient later,” said Dr. Amit Sachdev, medical director of the department of neurology and ophthalmology at Michigan State University, who wasn’t involved in the study. Related article
      Regular internet use may be linked to lower dementia risk in older adults, study says But the authors discovered that the digital dementia hypothesis may not bear out: Their analysis of 57 studies totaling 411,430 older adults found technology use was associated with a 42% lower risk of cognitive impairment, which was defined as a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, or as subpar performance on cognitive tests. Forms of technology included computers, smartphones, internet, email, social media or “mixed/multiple uses,” according to the new study. “That these effects were found in studies even when factors like education, income, and other lifestyle factors were adjusted was also encouraging: the effect doesn’t seem just due to other brain health factors,” co-lead study author Dr. Jared Benge, associate professor in the department of neurology at the University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School, said via email. The authors searched eight databases for studies published through 2024, and the 57 chosen for their main analysis included 20 studies that followed participants for about six years on average and 37 cross-sectional studies, which measure health data and outcomes at one point in time. The adults were age 68 on average at the beginning of the studies. While technology use was generally linked with a lower risk of cognitive decline, the findings for social media use were inconsistent, the authors said. None of the 136 studies the authors reviewed overall reported an increased risk of cognitive impairment correlated with technology use — a consistency that is “really quite rare,” said co-lead study author Dr. Michael Scullin, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University, via email. The research is “a really well-organized and -executed meta-analysis of essentially the entire field over the last 18 years or 20 years,” said Dr. Christopher Anderson, chief of the division of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Anderson wasn’t involved in the study. Related article
      Alzheimer’s risk rises when amount of deep sleep falls, study suggests But if you’re thinking the study’s findings mean you’re free to use technology to your heart’s content since your brain will be fine anyway — not so fast. “Our findings are not a blanket endorsement of mindless scrolling,” Benge, who is also a clinical neuropsychologist at UT Health Austin’s Comprehensive Memory Center, said. “They are instead a hint that the generation that gave us the internet has found ways to get some net positive benefits from these tools to the brain.” And despite the study’s significance, there are still many uncertainties about the relationships between various aspects of technology use and brain health. Technology use and the brain One of the study’s limitations is that it doesn’t have details on how people were using technological devices, experts said. As a result, it’s unclear whether participants were using computers or phones in ways that meaningfully exercised their brains, or what specific way may be most associated with cognitive protection. Lacking information on the amount of time technology was used means it’s also unknown whether there is harmful threshold or if only a little time is needed for cognitive benefits, Anderson said. These questions are difficult “to try to answer, because the sheer volume of technology exposures that we have to navigate is so high,” Sachdev said. “To isolate one technology exposure and its effect is difficult, and to measure just a whole ecosystem of technology exposures and … their aggregate effect is also a challenge.” Additionally, “the amount that we can extrapolate from this study towards future generations is very unclear, given the ubiquity of technology today that people are exposed to and have been exposed to from their birth,” Anderson said. Related article
      How internet addiction may affect your teen’s brain, according to a new study “When you think about the kind of technology that this cohort would’ve been interacting with earlier in their lives, it’s a time when you had to really work to use technology,” Anderson added. Their brains were also already well formed, Benge said. The study may support the alternative to the digital dementia hypothesis, which is the cognitive reserve theory. The theory “contends that exposure to complex mental activities leads to better cognitive well-being in older age,” even in the face of age-related brain changes, according to the study. That technology may reduce risk of cognitive decline by helping us be more neurologically active is possible, Sachdev said. Technology use can also foster social connection in some instances, and social isolation has been linked with greater odds of developing dementia. It’s also possible that older adults who are using technology may already have more active and resilient brains, explaining their engagement with technology. Managing your technology use Inferences on best practices for technology use in consideration of cognitive health can’t be drawn from the study since it didn’t have specifics on participants’ use habits, experts said. But “it does support that a healthy mix of activities is likely to be the most beneficial, and that fits with other literature on the topic as well,” Anderson said. “What this probably does more than anything else is provide some reassurance that there’s no association between at least moderate use of technology and cognitive decline.” Related article
      Heavy drinking linked with lasting impact on the brain, study finds Engaging in moderation is best, Sachdev said.

But if you’re experiencing eye or neck strain from sitting in front of a screen, that’s a sign you’re using technology too much. “Too much of anything can be a bad thing,” Sachdev said. “Identifying the purpose and the duration and then executing along those lines is how we would advise for most topics.” Some older adults have avoided technology use, thinking it’s too difficult to learn. But Scullin and others have found even people with mild dementia can be trained to use such devices, he said. Though sometimes frustrating, the difficulty “is a reflection of the mental stimulation afforded through learning the device,” Scullin added.",,0.1844393014907837

      What people should know about stress, according to a doctor Difference between acute and chronic stress It helps to distinguish between two types of stress: acute and chronic. Acute stress is your body’s immediate reaction to a perceived threat. Think about how your heart pounds before a big presentation or how you jump when you hear a loud noise. It’s intense but usually short-lived. Our bodies are built to handle acute stress and typically return to normal afterward. Chronic stress, however, is persistent. It’s the daily weight of ongoing issues, such as financial woes, relationship issues, work pressures or health concerns. Unlike acute stress, chronic stress keeps you in a constant state of high alert — chipping away at your health, often without you noticing. The internal stress response When you are stressed, your body launches a carefully coordinated response known as the fight-or-flight reaction. It all begins in the hypothalamus, the brain’s command center, which activates two parallel systems in your adrenal glands: the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, or HPA, axis. The sympathetic nervous   system triggers the release of adrenaline, which primes your body to act quickly. This fast-acting hormone increases your heart rate and blood pressure, opens up your airways, heightens your senses and sends more blood to your muscles. Cortisol is released a little later through the HPA axis. Unlike adrenaline’s quick action, cortisol plays a longer-term role in helping the body cope with sustained stress. Cortisol increases blood sugar, enhances the brain’s focus and memory, and puts things such as digestion, fertility and immunity on the back burner — because in a crisis, your body is focused on survival. Working together, adrenaline and cortisol   seamlessly help the body cope with short-term threats. However, if stress becomes chronic, elevated cortisol levels can lead to fatigue, sleep problems, weight gain and other health issues. For me, this response kicks in during intense moments in surgery — such as seeing an unexpected gush of bleeding. Instead of fleeing (which would be frowned upon in the operating room), my body shifts into fight mode: I zero in on the bleeding vessel, focus sharply and act swiftly to get things under control. In such high-stakes moments, the stress response is not just helpful but essential.  But when the triggers are constant — unpaid bills or work deadlines — your body can get stuck in that heightened state. Over time, consistently high cortisol levels disrupt your immune system, impair metabolism, affect mood regulation and even contribute to chronic inflammation — all of which can increase the risk of long-term health issues.

      Stress has a sweet spot. 5 tips to help you find it Your bladder under stress Have you ever noticed how anxiety makes you suddenly need the bathroom — especially right before a big speech or meeting? I experience this firsthand before every speech or live TV appearance: Without fail, my bladder goes into overdrive, and I find myself desperately looking for the nearest restroom. Stress directly affects bladder control by overstimulating the nerves responsible for regulating bladder function, leading to increased urgency, more frequent trips to the bathroom and even occasional leaking. My most memorable (and embarrassing) bladder moment was just before delivering a TEDx talk. There I was, backstage with two microphones strapped on, hair and makeup flawless, counting down the final two minutes before going live. Then suddenly — my bladder called. With no time to spare, I sprinted to the bathroom. I was still there when they announced my name. I bolted back out, breathless, laughing awkwardly as I stepped onto the stage. I played it off as a joke then, but deep down I knew my bladder was reacting to stress. Research has consistently linked higher stress and anxiety levels with overactive bladder symptoms. Your bladder doesn’t just respond to how much fluid you’ve had to drink; it also reacts dramatically to your mental state. Related article
      What your peeing frequency can say about your health Stress in the bedroom Chronic stress is no friend to your sex life. When your body is constantly flooded with stress hormones such as cortisol, it throws your natural hormonal balance out of sync — significantly reducing levels of testosterone in men and estrogen in women. As stress hormones rise, sex hormones fall. The result? Lower libido, erectile dysfunction in men, difficulties with arousal in women, and trouble reaching orgasm for everyone. Studies have highlighted psychological stress as one of the leading causes of sexual dysfunction among otherwise healthy adults, emphasizing just how deep the mind and body are connected when it comes to sexual health. But hormones aren’t the only factor. Chronic stress can also affect blood flow, which is vital for sexual response. And when stress disrupts your sleep, it further compounds the problem since sleep is essential for healthy hormone production and sexual functioning. The emotional toll is equally significant. When you’re stressed, intimacy and connection often take a back seat as your mind becomes occupied with worries. Over time, this pattern can strain relationships, further dampening sexual desire. If you’ve noticed stress affecting intimacy, remember it’s not “all in your head.” It’s a super complex hormonal, physical and emotional response — one you can address by taking steps to reduce stress and prioritize relaxation, intimacy and self-care.

      To prevent performance anxiety from interfering with a healthy sex life, mindfulness is an answer Stress and sleep Chronic stress can also hijack your sleep. High cortisol levels and persistent anxiety prevent deep, restorative sleep, leaving you feeling exhausted even after a full night in bed. Poor sleep then elevates stress levels further, creating a frustrating, self-perpetuating cycle that can profoundly affect your health. I experienced this firsthand last year. I went through a period of terrible sleep — tossing, turning, waking frequently and never feeling truly rested. I started gaining weight rapidly, and despite dedicated workouts, I didn’t see progress in the gym. I felt sluggish, drained and defeated. Eventually, I had to acknowledge that my poor sleep, driven by chronic stress, was the real culprit. Related article
      Cognitive shuffling: A mental trick to help you quiet racing thoughts and fall asleep Chronic stress can cause serious health problems Beyond affecting sleep, chronic stress is a powerful trigger for numerous serious health conditions. Sustained exposure to cortisol and other stress hormones promotes inflammation, suppresses immune function and creates conditions in the body that set the stage for disease. Chronic stress has been directly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. The American Heart Association emphasizes that stress not only directly raises blood pressure but also indirectly contributes to unhealthy habits, including smoking, poor diet and sedentary lifestyles. At one point, chronic stress started causing me frequent heart palpitations. Initially, I blamed caffeine, lack of sleep due to being on call and general fatigue. When I finally saw a cardiologist and underwent extensive testing, my diagnosis was stress. I was stunned. I am a physician accustomed to diagnosing others, yet chronic stress had quietly compromised my own heart health. The risks associated with stress don’t end at your heart. Research suggests chronic stress might even accelerate cancer progression by impairing your body’s immune defenses and creating conditions that encourage cancer cell growth. Chronic stress also increases the risk for metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes as well as mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. My own experiences served as a powerful wake-up call: Stress was not a minor inconvenience — it was a genuine threat to my overall health. Recognizing and addressing it through targeted stress-management strategies isn’t just good advice — it could literally save your life. Related article
      How to keep your cool in any situation, according to a rapid response nurse Don’t let stress win While stress is unavoidable, understanding how it affects your bladder, sexual health, hormones, sleep and overall well-being gives you the power to recognize and manage it before it takes control. To be clear, not all stress is harmful. Acute stress can even motivate you, helping you tackle challenges head-on. But chronic stress — the kind that builds quietly from daily pressures such as financial worries or family concerns — is what slowly chips away at your health, often going unnoticed until symptoms become impossible to ignore. So, the next time you catch yourself anxiously refreshing your retirement portfolio or losing sleep over your kids’ futures, take a moment. Step away. Stretch. Take a short walk. Or just breathe. These small acts can lower stress levels, reset your nervous system and protect your long-term health. And yes, I’ll be prescribing the same medicine to myself.

"Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. In one 48-hour period this winter the garbage disposal went out, the dishwasher stopped working, one of my kids left the garage door open overnight, and two pipes burst. Sometimes these singular problems multiply like rabbits, and I lay awake at night going over budgets and worrying about finances. Or I focus on the past and wonder what I could have done to prevent all of this. My thoughts get loud and crowded, screaming matches occur in my mind, and I start to feel tingling in my forearms. By morning, my patience is gone, my stress and anxiety are up, and my family can pay the price. During this latest pileup, I ran around trying to get a handle on everything, needing help but feeling overloaded so I didn’t ask for it. My youngest son spotted trouble and warned his siblings: “Dad is doing that fast walk thing — watch out.” I’m usually patient with my three children, but when I’m overloaded, I become a tyrant with a short temper who barks orders. In these moments, my wife pulls me away just so I can breathe. “There are battles going on inside the minds of men,” said Dr. Jett Stone, a clinical psychologist based in Greenwich, Connecticut, and author of “Quiet Your Mind: A Men’s Guide: Practical Techniques to Stop Overthinking and Take Charge of Your Life.” “Men tend to externalize, which means that the inner stuff gets put out into the world, whether it’s reckless driving, drinking or hyperactivity,” said Stone, who specializes in men’s mental health. “Men are socialized into holding back their interior life.” Stone gave me hope that it doesn’t have to be that way, sharing his guidance for how men can learn to calm our thoughts and take control of our actions. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What are the health consequences of men overthinking about our lives? Dr. Jett Stone: It can cause stress, and then your heart beats faster, your hands get clammy, and you might get a headache. Or maybe you feel something else. Everyone has different physical symptoms. One of the best places to catch overthinking is by noticing how your body feels. Sometimes it’s simpler for men to access their bodies than it is to access what’s going on in their minds. CNN: Why are men overthinking, and how can we stop doing it? Stone: Men are being asked to take on more of the mental load, which includes emotional labor — which is the time spent helping to address, manage and regulate the emotions of your kids and yourself around parenting. They are also asked to take on more of the cognitive load, which is what you need to do as a parent. One example: I need to pick up the kids from a sports practice, which means I need to plan it and then execute it. It’s the executive function of being a modern parent. It’s laborious and invisible. We are naturally going to feel more cluttered in our minds. It is a function of modern society demanding more of fathers and rightfully so. Related article
      Common roadblocks that men face in their male friendships and a road map for getting past them The first step is recognizing and naming the overthinking. Even just calling that out to yourself is incredibly powerful. The next step would be to get in touch with the triggers of it. What are your particular triggers for overthinking when it comes to fatherhood? For some dads, it comes with, “Am I spending enough quality time with my kids with the demands of work?” “Did I react too harshly?” “Can I provide enough for my family?” These are all questions that can set men off on mental loops. The next step is to do a quick breathing routine like a cyclic sigh, which has really strong health benefits and really produces calm. Basically, it is two inhalations, followed by a really slow out-breath. You can combine this with a mindfulness technique called a body scan. Go from the top of your body to the bottom or vice versa and notice your body markers of your stress. Notice that tension in your shoulders, arms or wherever. Breathe into it, tense it up and relax it. Related article
      The male loneliness epidemic and how it affects fathers CNN: You talk about mapping your thoughts. What is that, and how it can help? Stone: Mapping is recognizing what triggers your overthinking and then asking where does this go. It’s pinpointing those moments. For example, let’s say your boss gives you feedback about your underperformance in a meeting, and afterward, you find yourself stuck in a mental loop. Your mind might go from “I sounded so stupid in front of him” to “I’ll never be able to buy a home if I don’t make more money.” Using mapping, you would slow down, shift your focus and begin to notice and categorize the path your mind takes. Instead of fueling the overthinking, you zoom out and map through writing or observing how your thoughts veered across themes: from self-image to financial security, all in one loop. These are some of the categories I include in the book. In this example, one small interaction triggered a familiar mental route. “Mapping” this route using common categories helps you recognize where your mind tends to go when left to its own devices.

      Boys and men are experiencing a ‘crisis of connection,’ expert says CNN: Instead of churning through our thoughts, you say we need to find “our deeper drives.” What does that mean, and how do we do it? Stone: Our deeper drives, a term from psychologist Steven Hayes’ work, are things like belonging, wanting to connect and be accepted by others, competence, to feel like you’re capable and effective. They are human needs. This may require some solo contemplation, dialogue with friends, therapy or journaling. Ask yourself: “What am I seeking? Am I seeking something like belonging? Am I missing a sense of orientation in the world, meaning, fulfillment or direction?” It’s never usually one thing. It can be incredibly liberating when you can pinpoint an unmet drive. It’s no longer about saying this is not just some silly insecurity that I have. It’s something all humans need. CNN: One way you suggest quieting the mind is to practice gratitude and kindness. How do you do that, and what are the benefits? Stone: Juxtapose gratitude with overthinking. Overthinking is narrowly focused, while gratitude increases your field of vision. Helping others expands that visual field. It helps you gain perspective and move beyond the self-referential type of thinking into the outer world and where you need it, where you can lend a hand. Showing gratitude can be done in a text to friend, a phone call to your parent or verbally saying  (something) to a spouse or partner. It can be as simple as saying thank you for cleaning the kitchen. A gratitude journal is a way to making yourself aware of what to be grateful for in your life. You can simply write down a couple of things or people you are grateful for each morning. Related article
      Ashton Hall’s ‘morning routine’ highlights the pressures men face today CNN: How can fathers control their anger rather than lashing out at family, friends or ourselves? Stone: There’s usually stuff that lives beneath the anger. Sometimes anger is righteous, justified and productive. Sometimes, it is unproductive anger, which is not effective. If you notice you are angry, a stop sign needs to come up in your mind at that moment. Pause and just breathe. A lot of times we are not breathing in those moments. Taking the time to do that can take anger from a 10 to a 9. Observe it for a second and even just ask yourself one question. What do I want from this? What are my goals? It then can take that anger from an 8 to a 7. Anger can be really scary for family members, especially coming from a dad, because it’s a big, intimidating emotion. Channel that instinct and do a little bit of self-interrogation. The second question you can ask is what is living beneath? What emotions are living beneath this anger? Am I fearful of not being able to provide for my family? Am I feeling ashamed that I’m not holding my weight? Related article
      Anger gets a bad rap, but it can be an asset, experts say. Here’s what to do with it CNN: What do you do when the man you want to be conflicts with the man whom you present to the world? Stone: I would say that those aren’t two different parts of yourself. You are many selves, and both of those are part of who you are, but accepting that can be very hard. It’s a part of you, and you need to be aware of it. It’s getting those perspectives out of opposition and becoming more at peace that we are many things.

More than 55 million people worldwide have dementia, a number expected to nearly triple by 2050. Deaths from strokes may double by the same year, and 10% to 20% of adults experience depression later in life. While the numbers are striking, there’s a growing body of evidence showing that many of these cases may not be genetically fated, but rather could be delayed or prevented altogether by addressing health factors generally within our control. At least 17 factors contribute to dementia, stroke and late-life depression, according to an extensive review published Wednesday in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry. Related article
      Adults may want to consider revisiting their childhood hobbies, according to a psychologist Addressing the 17 factors can reduce people’s risk for all three conditions. Those factors are, in no order of importance: “This study just really shows how powerful lifestyle and behavioral changes are for age-related brain diseases,” said senior study author Dr. Sanjula Singh, an instructor in neurology at Harvard Medical School and principal investigator at the Brain Care Labs at Massachusetts General Hospital. “Ultimately, we hope that people feel like there’s a hopeful message in here — that there are actually so many things that you can work on, and then not only your risk of stroke is lower, but also of dementia and/or of late-life depression,” Singh noted. In the past, studies, tools or risk-prediction models have usually focused on these conditions individually. “From a human perspective, that doesn’t make a lot of sense,” Singh said. Ideally, people wouldn’t want to develop any of these conditions, she added, so the research team wanted to find shared risk factors so people can essentially achieve multiple goals using the same tools. Measuring the impact of lifestyle The authors reviewed 59 meta-analyses — syntheses of data from multiple similar studies — that were published between 2000 and 2023 and had investigated the effects of modifiable risk factors on stroke, dementia and/or late-life depression among adults who weren’t previously diagnosed with these conditions.

      Small study hints anti-amyloid therapy may keep Alzheimer’s symptoms at bay in certain patients All 17 factors were shared by at least two of the conditions, but there were no meta-analyses on relationships between late-life depression and 11 of the health measures: alcohol intake, BMI, blood sugar, cognitive activity, diet, hearing loss, kidney function, pain, physical activity, social engagement and stress, according to the study. Of all the measures, blood pressure had the biggest impact. A normal blood pressure level is below 120 over 80 millimeters of mercury, or mm Hg. People with a level of 140/90 mm Hg or greater were more than twice as likely to have a stroke, 20% more likely to develop dementia and 16% more likely to experience depression. Other top influential factors were smoking, sleep, physical activity and blood sugar. “Grouping these all together is important, because I think different people derive different levels of motivation to make a behavior change” based on their personal concerns, such as a family history of dementia, stroke or depression, said Dr. Richard Isaacson, preventive neurologist and director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson wasn’t involved in the study. “Data studies like this can help empower people to make meaningful changes in their day-to-day lives,” Isaacson added. Lowering risk for age-related brain diseases If 17 items seem overwhelming, look at it as a menu from which you can choose a few items — and work your way through the list over time, Singh said. But also know these factors overlap, she said — if you’re improving your diet and exercise, for example, you’re probably improving several things on that list, including blood pressure, blood sugar, sleep and cholesterol.

      Early research suggests why exercise is so protective against brain disease Not sure what to choose? Here’s how you can address what experts said are some of the most important determinants of dementia, stroke and depression. Lowering high blood pressure: High blood pressure means less blood flow to the brain, which has a direct relationship with stroke and dementia, but is also associated with depression by way of reducing neurotransmitters in the brain, Isaacson said. To address high blood pressure, you can have your level checked by a machine at a drugstore, a doctor or a home device, experts said. Lowering salt intake and getting enough potassium are important for reducing blood pressure, as well as exercising, losing excess weight, managing stress and seeing a sleep specialist if you have sleep apnea. A doctor can determine whether you also need medication. Stop smoking: If you smoke, there are five actions you can take right now to quit, which concern identifying your triggers, learning from relapses, using helplines and apps, and speaking with doctors who can help you devise a treatment plan. Improve your fitness: For physical activity, know that any amount is better than none — and the World Health Organization has guidelines for the type, frequency and duration of exercise you need depending on your age. Get enough sleep: Older adults need at least seven hours of sleep nightly. You can help ensure a good night’s rest by keeping your room cool, quiet and dark; not drinking alcohol or caffeine in the several hours before bed; limiting screen time at night; and having a bedtime routine. Regulate your blood sugar: Exercise, weight management and a healthy diet that limits refined carbohydrates and added sugars can also maintain healthy blood sugar levels. The findings from the latest study inform the existing Brain Care Score, which was developed in 2023 at the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital to help people gauge and manage their risk for dementia or stroke without medical procedures.

"Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. “Everybody’s working for the weekend,” according to Canadian rock band Loverboy. If you work a traditional five-day workweek, you might relate to that feeling. But if someone is in a constant loop of dreading Monday through Friday and only looking forward to days off, it might not be the most fulfilling way to live, psychology experts say. “It’s totally understandable, and a lot of people are living their lives in that way, but I don’t think it’s the most satisfying way,” said Dr. James Pawelski, professor of practice and director of education in the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “There are five weekdays and only two weekend days. So, if most of (the time) you’re looking back or you’re looking forward, you’re missing out on your life,” Pawelski said. Whether or not you have your dream job, there are ways to incorporate more activities you enjoy throughout the week to make the workdays more exciting. Here’s what Pawelski and other experts want you to know about finding that work-life balance rather than waiting for the weekend. Structuring the weekdays After a busy workday, it’s tempting to want to go home and plop down on the couch for the rest of the evening — even Pawelski agrees. But sometimes an extra push to do a different activity after work can be more energizing and satisfying. “It’s a paradox — we think it’s taking a break that energizes, right? If you’re on empty, you just got to take a break until you feel more energy,” he said. “But it turns out that effort energizes.” Instead of scheduling every activity on the weekend, Pawelski recommends planning a fun or goal-focused activity during the week to keep momentum going after work. Related article
      Why reading is a form of therapy Pawelski has started Thursday night improv classes with his wife, Suzann Pileggi Pawelski. And they both go, even when they’re tired. “When it comes around to Thursday night, and it’s been a crazy busy week. And if you said to me, ‘Would you like to go to improv right now? … or would you rather just kind of sit down and relax?’ I’d probably say, ‘You know what, I’m exhausted. I just want to sit down and relax,” Pawelski said. “But the thing is, it’s already scheduled. It’s paid for. We now have really good friends there. … And so, you know, you get to improv, and before long, it’s like, ‘Oh my goodness. This is so energizing.’” When the next day rolls around, it feels more satisfying to have followed through with your promises, even if it was hard in the moment, said Pileggi Pawelski, a well-being writer and positive psychology expert. The couple coauthored the book “Happy Together: Using the Science of Positive Psychology to Build Love That Lasts.” Shared activities can also help build relationships and foster those moments to connect with people throughout the week, she added. “We live our lives in the moment, and unfortunately, a lot of people miss the opportunity to connect if you’re just waiting for the weekend, whether it’s with your romantic partner, your friends (or) colleagues at work.” Related article
      Kindness will make you happier than a higher salary, report shows To make more meaningful interactions that feel less transactional than the usual small talk during the week, Pileggi Pawelski recommends setting a goal to learn something new about a person every day, asking them questions that relate to them and their individuality. Planned activities that both people find exciting, such as the improv classes, a team sport or a meetup for coffee and a puzzle, are also helpful to making these connections. “Our relationships and our social connections are the most important thing to well-being, and I think a lot of us lose ourselves in work,” she said. “Just think of something that brings you joy. There’s no right or wrong. … Plan that activity — ideally, you know, doing something with other people — and put it in your calendar to do it regularly.” By adding in other activities outside work, people also tend to diversify their identities, which helps during the inevitable setbacks and failures throughout a career, said Dr. Emiliana Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. The center is a research institute that studies the psychology, sociology and neuroscience of well-being. For example, someone might think, “I might have missed that due date or lost that opportunity to do a project, because now we don’t have the funding for it,” Simon-Thomas added. “But my friends and neighbors are all so excited to talk with me about the book that we all read … or I have to show up and play second base (in baseball) on Tuesday, and I’m important, and I matter in those other contexts.” Finding meaning in work The average person will spend an estimated one-third of their life at work — about 90,000 hours. If someone does not enjoy what they do during this large chunk of time, it can be “a huge problem,” said Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky, a researcher on happiness and a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside. But if someone is not able to switch jobs to something more in tune with their interests, there are other ways to spin a more positive outlook on work, said Lyubomirsky, who is also the author of the book “The How of Happiness: A Scientific Approach to Getting the Life You Want.” Related article
      Adults may want to consider revisiting their childhood hobbies, according to a psychologist When thinking about your daily activities, ask yourself if “there is something you can find that you feel like, ‘maybe this is making the life of one person easier or better,’” Lyubomirsky said. Even by completing small tasks such as sending out an email at work, a person can relate this effort back to core values and goals, Simon-Thomas said. Whether someone is interested in a career path in science and studying longevity, or invested in the arts and hope to inspire future generations, these small tasks can point to larger goals, she said. Tell yourself something like, “I’m answering those emails so that I can accomplish this particular task, which will enable us to commence this project. And this project is in the service of this bigger aim or vision or goal that’s so valuable to me,” she added. Related article

"The saying goes that when America sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold — pithy shorthand to describe how changes in the world’s biggest economy ripple out to impact everyone else. But that adage doesn’t go nearly far enough to convey the enormity of the likely fallout from US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a colossal set of new tariffs on America’s trading partners. “The US isn’t sneezing, the US is hacking off one of its limbs,” Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, told CNN. At the start of the year, the American economy was “in a very good place,” he noted. Now, “if these tariffs continue as they are, (it will) probably tip into recession.” And that, he said, will likely have a knock-on negative impact on economies around the world. On Wednesday, Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all goods imports into the United States and even higher tariffs on products from about 60 economies. The harder-hit trading partners include China and the European Union, which face new duties of 34% and 20% respectively. But America is harming itself as much as, if not more than, other economies with its latest tariffs, analysts say. A recession in America? If Trump keeps in place the tariffs announced Wednesday, recession is a likely outcome for both the US and the world this year, JPMorgan said in a note Thursday. The tariffs will cause prices in America to surge, too, adding close to 2% to the Consumer Price Index in 2025, according to the bank. Related live-story
      Trump launches historic global trade war The key measure of US inflation has struggled to come back down to earth in recent years and was 2.8% higher in February than a year ago, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “This year’s cumulative tariff hike should be viewed as a US tax increase of roughly $660 billion,” JPMorgan analysts said, noting that this amounted to the largest tax increase in recent decades by far. “The impact on inflation will be substantial.” The overall economic “shock” from Trump’s tariffs will be exacerbated by any retaliatory measures imposed by America’s trading partners on US goods, the analysts also wrote. And retaliation is on the cards. In the hours following Trump’s announcement, the EU — the largest single market for US goods exports — said it was preparing countermeasures, and China condemned what it called “unilateral bullying” from the US and vowed to retaliate. Deep economic downturns are typically marked by mass job losses, bankruptcies and foreclosures — very much the opposite of Trump’s stated ambition to “Make America Wealthy Again” through his tariff plan. The US president may still suspend or dilute the tariffs announced Wednesday as he has done with other import levies in recent weeks. But any fresh import taxes are likely to slow the US economy, said Donovan at UBS. Similarly, economists at Deutsche Bank noted “a meaningful increase in recession risk in the US” in research published Thursday. What about everyone else? Other economies are expected to take a hit on several fronts. A recession or slowing economic growth in the US would cause mighty American consumers to pull back on spending, which in turn would lower demand for foreign goods. If businesses outside the US experience a drop in demand for their products, they may become more cautious, Donovan said. “Are they going to carry on investing, are they going to carry on employing people?” Deutsche Bank economists expect unemployment to increase in the EU and the United Kingdom over the next 12-18 months as a result of Trump’s tariffs. The new import taxes could also dent demand for foreign goods in America by making them more expensive than equivalent products made in the US. That, of course, is what Trump wants — the president has said his tariff agenda is designed to lift demand for US-made products and boost America’s manufacturing sector. Other new headaches for exporters to the US include uncertainty, disruption of supply chains and “burdensome” bureaucracy, according to Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU’s executive arm. “All businesses, big and small, will suffer from day one… The costs of doing business with the United States will drastically increase,” she said Thursday. Consumers outside the US will be affected mostly if their governments engage in a tit for tat with the Trump administration. Thomas Sampson, an economics professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, told CNN that, without retaliation, the US tariffs’ direct impact on European consumers, for example, would be relatively small. But higher tariffs on US imports into the region would raise prices. In that case, “European consumers will face the same sort of price increases that US consumers are facing,” he said. The EU responded to Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, announced earlier, by unveiling countermeasures on up to 26 billion euros ($29 billion) worth of exports of American goods, including tariffs on boats, bourbon and motorbikes. This time the EU may hold fire. France’s finance minister said Friday that the bloc was not looking primarily at reciprocal tariffs to respond to Trump’s latest trade salvo as that could hurt European consumers. Measures under consideration include targeting individual firms rather than whole sectors, Eric Lombard told CNN affiliate BFMTV. But other governments may well be less circumspect. “If there’s retaliation by the other countries, you might have similar pressure on inflation in other countries,” Antonio Fatas, an economics professor at business school INSEAD, told CNN. Still, analysts say America’s trading partners benefit from the simple fact that they will only have tariffs placed on their goods by one country — America — whereas the US faces retaliatory levies on its goods from many of its major trading partners. Oxford Economics thinks the global economy will still probably avoid a recession this year. But its performance will be nothing to write home about. Growth could fall below 2%, Ben May, director of macroeconomic research, wrote in a report Thursday. “It would be the weakest annual growth rate since the global financial crisis, excluding the pandemic period,” he said.

The fact that traditional Western and alternative medicine have yet to confirm either a cause or a solution doesn’t help. Psychotherapist Nicole Sachs is determined to interrupt this bleak narrative with a cure rooted in evidence-based brain science and mind-body medicine. In her new book, “Mind Your Body: A Revolutionary Program to Release Chronic Pain and Anxiety,” the author, podcaster and public speaker shares her method for eliminating not just chronic pain but also long Covid-19, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and many other conditions. Where medication, physical therapy, supplements, procedures and treatments have failed, her approach, using a targeted writing practice called JournalSpeak, offers a possible cure. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What is mind-body medicine, and what role does it play in chronic pain? Nicole Sachs: Mind-body medicine is a paradigm that recognizes the influence of stored trauma and repressed emotions on physical health. My mentor, Dr. John Sarno, was a pioneering practitioner who challenged the Western assumption that pain or discomfort always correlates directly with the affected body part. His scientific work uncovered that, while real, some physical symptoms are not always tied to pathology in the body. Dr. Sarno called this condition Tension Myoneural Syndrome, or TMS, which is an umbrella term for the epidemic of chronic conditions that do not resolve by treating the symptomatic area of the body. Instead, chronic pain and other conditions can result from nervous system dysregulation that creates physical symptoms in response to stored trauma and an overflow of repressed emotions. CNN: How can emotional stress cause physical symptoms? Sachs: First, it helps to remember that all humans have unconscious processes that are essential to living, like circulating our blood, breathing or making our heart beat. In a sense, the unconscious nervous system signaling that causes chronic pain is equally reflexive. Beneath consciousness, each of us has an emotional reservoir that holds the extent of our grief, rage, terror, despair and shame. The extremity of these feelings is kept below the surface, under the cover of darkness, because feeling the pain of these emotions all the time would make it impossible to live our lives. Humans are a social species, and our need for connection is as imperative as food and water. If we were constantly aware of the depth of our emotional pain, we’d be too shut down to connect with others. So, our nervous system tries to keep that pain under wraps. But everyone reaches a point in life when this reservoir starts to bubble over. Too much stress, trauma or some devastating life event and all the emotions that have been stuffed down start to knock at the door of consciousness. That’s when our nervous system steps in. CNN: Why would the nervous system intentionally cause pain? Sachs: Our nervous system has evolved to protect us against threats. Your brain perceives your repressed emotional world and stored trauma as predators, seeing them as far more dangerous problems than the physical manifestations of pain — because they’re not easy to solve. And so, alarm bells go off. The nervous system switches into fight, flight, freeze or fawn mode. When your emotional “reservoir” becomes overwhelmed, your brain sends pain signals as a protective strategy. Related article
      A fitness expert shares a game plan for living without back pain If you are someone who struggles with back pain, for instance, that’s likely your nervous system triggering symptoms to keep you safe — I call this “safe in the un-safest way.” Back pain might trigger you to take a pill, get into bed and cancel your plans for the day. This restores to the brain a sense of control and familiarity. However unwanted consciously, illness and injury are protective. They require us to slow down and allow us to ask for help, draw boundaries, say no and stay home. And just as you don’t have a choice about whether to pull your hand off a hot stove, you don’t get to decide not to have back pain right now if your reservoir is overflowing. CNN: Does this mean the pain isn’t real? Sachs: The pain is very real; it just originates from emotional rather than physical stressors. Here’s the fascinating part — all pain signals get fired by the brain and nervous system, landing in different bodily systems and muscles. All pain is felt from the brain. So, when you burn your finger, the nerves in your finger tell the brain that the sensory environment has changed. Then the brain, in a flash, interprets the level of danger and sends pain signals back to the finger. Pain’s No. 1 objective is to protect you. With TMS, the brain sends these same pain signals as a protective mechanism, even without physical injury. Today’s brain imaging technology even reveals that whether someone is experiencing emotional heartbreak or just broke their ankle the same part of the brain lights up. CNN: What’s the cure? Sachs: Treatment has three key components. The first part of my prescription is knowledge. I need to teach you about the brain science and provide enough human examples to help you believe and not dismiss that this is what’s happening in your human body. The second component of treatment is JournalSpeak — a specific writing practice I developed to release emotions. The third is practicing patience and kindness for yourself — self-compassion is a verb! Related article
      Startling new science reveals the truth about chronic pain CNN: What is JournalSpeak, and how is it different from other forms of writing? Sachs: JournalSpeak is a 20-minute, unfiltered writing practice, informed by your understanding of the nervous-system science, where you express your most unreasonable, raw emotions. This practice is like putting a ladle into the reservoir and dumping it out systematically, one day at a time. Once the level drops below maximum capacity, the pain signals stop firing, because your nervous system no longer feels the urgency to protect you from conscious awareness. After the 20 minutes, you destroy the writing. It’s about releasing, not analyzing. Like blowing your nose into a tissue, you don’t need to look at it again. CNN: How could complaining on paper heal pain? Sachs: JournalSpeak is like a venting apparatus for a closed system. Energy is neither created nor destroyed; it shifts from one form to another. The energy of grief and rage and shame and fear gets transformed into physical pain in the closed system of the human body. Writing the most unbridled, impolite, unreasonable, pathetic rant that gives voice to unseen, unheard parts of you opens a relief valve that transfers emotional pain onto the page. Once that energy is vented, the nervous system stops sending physical pain signals. Related article
      Chronic foot pain is no fun. Get relief with this simple routine CNN: Is this approach limited to pain? Sachs﻿: Not at all. One person’s fatigue is another’s back pain, is another’s migraine or irritable bowel, or long Covid, and so on. The theory at the center of this approach is that there is one genesis for all these symptoms. The same principles can apply to autoimmune conditions, digestive issues and other chronic symptoms. The underlying mechanism is always the same: the nervous system sending signals as a protective response. When people realize that the sensations we feel in our body, no matter what they are, are controlled by the brain and the nervous system, they can understand why it really doesn’t matter how the symptoms are showing up. The central nervous system is the control room for everything in the human experience. Related article
      Here’s the pain relief advice I’ve spent 21 years looking for CNN: Do scientific studies back this up? Sachs: More and more scientific literature documents remission of pain and other chronic symptoms through mind-body practices. Recently, a randomized controlled trial by Dr. Michael Donnino, a professor of medicine and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, compared three treatment approaches for chronic back pain. The first group continued their existing treatment regimens, while the second took an eight-week mindfulness stress reduction course. Participants in the third group received a 12-week psychophysiological intervention based on Dr. Sarno’s work where they explored their emotional history using mind-body techniques. This group reported significantly less pain than participants in the other groups. About six months later, nearly 64% of people from the mind-body group reported being pain-free. Donnino’s findings from a similar study on long Covid showed that symptoms previously attributed to physical causes resolved with mind-body medicine. Related article
      Chronic pain is substantially more common in the US than diabetes, depression and high blood pressure, study finds CNN: How can someone tell if their symptoms are TMS-related? Sachs: First, consult a doctor to ensure that medically treatable diagnoses are not the root cause of your pain. But if you’ve had multiple medical tests with no clear explanation, if your pain moves around, or if it seems triggered by stress, these are potential TMS indicators. The key is understanding that pain can be a messenger, not just a malfunction. Once you receive a clean bill of health or you’re diagnosed with chronic symptoms deemed incurable, nervous system dysregulation is a likely cause, and it’s time to consider my three-part treatment approach. CNN: Do I need to change my life to heal my symptoms? Sachs: The goal is to recognize and process your emotions, not necessarily remove every source of stress. You don’t have to blow up your life, quit your job or put your kids up for adoption. You don’t need to change your life; you just need to know how you feel about it. Related article
      Let go of past pain: A mind-body approach to healing ancestral trauma CNN: What’s the first step toward mind-body healing? Sachs: Start with curiosity. Approach your body with compassion, listen to its signals and remember that healing is possible. The beauty of this approach is its fundamental message of hope: Your body is not broken, and you have the power to heal. It’s about understanding the intricate connection between your emotions and physical experience, and learning to work with your nervous system, not against it. Your body is trying to protect you. By understanding this, you can start a profound healing journey. You have so much more power than you realize to affect your physical and emotional health.

"“Liberation Day” came and went, with President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs battering markets, unsettling the global order, and prompting businesses and households to reconsider their spending. And it’s far from over. There’s the immediate aftermath: Trump’s actions, based on economically questionable math, have triggered retaliatory tariffs, stoked trade wars, and escalated recession odds. There are near-, medium-, and long-term risks: The dangerous mix of fear, unpredictability, lost investments, and sudden cost spikes could quickly spill into the economy, causing real and lasting pain for people. And there are likely more tariffs coming down the pike: A suite of crucial materials was exempt from Wednesday’s tariff actions, including copper, computer chips, lumber, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals. However, Trump administration officials have indicated these products could be subject to tariffs at a later date. It also remains to be seen whether Canada and Mexico, two of the biggest targets of Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs, will continue to be largely spared. “This list does not strike me as a negotiating position right now,” said Tyler Schipper, associate professor of economics at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. “Hopefully, some of these come down, but it’s a big list, and it’s across the board.” “This seems to suggest more like we’re putting up walls, rather than we’re negotiating to hopefully get all the walls to come down,” he added. The immediate aftermath Trump’s one-two tariff punch announced last week included a baseline 10% tariff on all imported goods to the US, followed by steeper “reciprocals” tariff on five dozen countries that the White House claimed were the “worst offenders” in charging high tariffs or imposing non-tariff trade barriers. The former went into place April 5, and the latter took effect Wednesday. However, the “reciprocal” tariffs were anything but that, further complicating and potentially amplifying the negative consequences of Trump’s actions. The additional levies, some of which shot north of 45%, were calculated by essentially dividing bilateral goods trade deficits by goods trade exports. Trade deficits, by their very nature, aren’t necessarily all bad. “It’s very wrongheaded economics; it’s quite natural that you will have deficits with some countries and surpluses with others,” economist Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN. “So, trying to implement a policy to generate balanced trade with all countries just flies in the face of any kind of comparative advantage or specialization.” Plus, the resulting tariffs should be a quarter lower than stated because the Trump administration erred in its calculations by undervaluing how the duty could impact items’ import prices, noted economists for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. The formula, which AEI economists said had “no foundation in either economic theory or trade law,” instead wrongly incorporated the elasticity for retail prices. As it stands, the Trump administration’s severe and widespread tariff actions flung a powder keg into the global economy, pushing recession forecasts higher. Domestically, the tariffs could have swiftly negative consequences, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned. “As for the short-term, we are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products,” he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. “How this plays out on different products will partially depend on their substitutability and price elasticity. Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.” Near- and long-term risks And plenty of uncertainties remain, Dimon noted, including the extent of retaliatory actions and the effects on confidence, investments, capital flows, corporate profits and the almighty dollar. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better, because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” he wrote. The freefall in the financial markets indicates there’s a crisis of confidence brewing in the US dollar, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist. “We can now not ignore nor avoid the discussion of the devaluation of the dollar and the dollar’s reserve currency status,” Brusuelas told CNN. In terms of the economic impact, even the best-case scenario involves accelerated inflation in addition to hits to real gross domestic product growth and unemployment, according to Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola-Marymount University and president of SS Economics, who detailed the economic implications for the US in a note issued last week. The best-case scenario over the next 12 months: Real GDP contracts by 0.2 percentage points, employment shrinks by 0.1% and inflation ticks up by 0.2 percentage points. The worst-case: Economic activity sinks 1.3 percentage points (real GDP grew 2.4% at the end of 2024), the US economy loses 1.3 million jobs, and inflation rises by 1.3 percentage points, he noted. Sohn, whose “base case” falls in between, expressed optimism that the US economy could be resilient enough to avoid a recession. A few factors played into his calculus: The US economy is overwhelmingly services-driven, so the sectoral composition should provide a cushion; tariffs are a one-time price adjustment and shouldn’t accelerate underlying inflation pressures; touted policies such as tax cuts and deregulation could provide a stimulating effect on demand; and now that the announcements have been made, it could ease uncertainty. However, certainty is anything but a sure thing these days, and the bread-and-butter of the US economy might not go unscathed, said RSM economist Brusuelas. “The US is a service-based economy,” he said. “That’s where the wealth is; that’s where the money is. (Countries) are going to likely retaliate against the banks, the airlines and tech.” Sectoral tariffs coming next The retaliation could very well escalate, depending on how the administration moves forward on plans for sectoral tariffs and Trump’s continued application of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (what used to be a rarely employed trade provision) that allows a president to impose tariffs if there are potential national security threats. Last week’s tariff announcement came with several notable exclusions: Steel, aluminum and autos (three areas already subjected to their tariffs); copper and lumber (which are under Section 232 investigations for potential national security impacts); and pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and critical minerals (where Section 232 investigations are expected). Trump has frequently quipped that the US doesn’t need to import items like lumber, cars and oil, claiming that natural resources and manufacturing potential are plentiful enough domestically for America to be self-sufficient.

      Tariffs on China set to rise to at least 104% on Wednesday, White House says Economists, researchers and other experts have frequently warned that it’s not that simple: It takes years for manufacturing facilities to be built, supply chains to be established, and skilled workforces to be trained. (Plus, the construction of those new facilities would likely require imported materials that now are coming at a premium.) Still, the sector tariffs could push inflation even higher, said Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide Mutual’s chief economist. Following last week’s announcement, Nationwide’s modeling indicated that the Consumer Price Index, which had cooled to an annual rate of 2.8% in February, could climb to between 3.5% and 4% by the end of the year. The sector tariffs could very well push that to the higher range of 4% to 4.5%, she said. CPI hasn’t been above 4% for nearly two years, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. In addition to those near- and longer-term headwinds, tariffs could pose unique challenges for each sector: Copper and critical minerals:  It’s not yet known which minerals the US could consider investigating under Section 232; however, an investigation is already underway on copper — a critical cog in the ongoing electrification of America and industries such as defense. Related article
      Trump invokes wartime powers to increase production of critical minerals The US imports about 50% of the copper it uses, and demand is only expected to grow, especially as energy-consuming industries such as artificial intelligence and blockchain boom, Dan Ikenson, economist and trade policy scholar at Ikenomics Consulting, told CNN. “It takes 16, 17, 18 years to get the licenses for mines and permits for refining,” he said. “Since we don’t have those resources, and we’re dependent on the world for it, we should not be agitating and looking to pick trade fights, we should be working out arrangements where we can have long-term access to Canada’s exports, Chile’s and Peru’s.” Lumber: Softwood lumber is a critical and preferred ingredient to homebuilding, and 30% of it is imported by the US. Homebuilders warn that tariffs and other charges (including the potential doubling of existing duties on Canadian lumber) on softwood lumber and other materials could further exacerbate the housing affordability crisis. Higher costs of lumber imports could also affect other products, such as furniture and even toilet paper. The Trump administration, to bolster the US lumber industry, recently ordered that half of America’s national forests be opened up for logging — a move criticized for its potential negative effects on the environment, species, watersheds, and recreation. Pharmaceuticals: Tariffs here present conflicting policy goals for Trump, who’s stated he wants to bring down the prices of pharmaceutical products and bolster US manufacturing, Diederik Stadig, health care sector economist for ING, wrote in a post last week. “While some branded production might gradually be shifted to the US, a big increase in generic production is unlikely,” he said, noting that the construction of new facilities takes roughly 10 years. Tariffs also have an inflationary effect, which would drive up health care costs and hamper the affordability of medication, especially for people without insurance: Under a 25% tariff, commonly prescribed drugs could increase from 82 cents per pill to 94 cents a pill, or roughly $42 more per year, he wrote. More complex prescriptions, such as those for cancer treatment, could jump even higher, he wrote, estimating that a 24-week prescription could see additional costs in the $8,000 to $10,000 range. Semiconductors: Medical devices, Wi-Fi routers, laptops, smartphones, cars, household appliances and LED lightbulbs are just a few examples of where semiconductor chips are found. And these products often don’t just require one or two. For instance, new cars contain thousands of them. Put another way, semiconductor chips are “the crude oil of the 21st century.” And it became glaringly obvious what happens when that oil runs dry: As a side effect of the pandemic, a chip shortage put cars and other products in short supply and fanned the flames of inflation. Although the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022 helped incentivize chipmakers like TSMC to open US facilities, even if tariffs spurred more domestic chip production, America still lacks electronic assembly capabilities, John Dallesasse, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, previously told CNN. Because of that, any chips produced in the US would still have to be shipped abroad to places like Taiwan, South Korea, China and Mexico to be put into the finished electronics Americans buy, and those would be subject to tariffs.

"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being. It’s time to do your taxes, so you sit down at the computer to knock them out, but then you have to text your partner to get details about your mortgage interest. That text turns into a quick check of your email, a few scrolls through social media, and then online shopping a sale at your favorite store –– before you know it, it has been an hour with no progress on your taxes. Sound familiar? To me, too. Blame the technology, right? Not so fast. As easy as it may be to blame smartphones for time spent on distractions, people get distracted with or without them, according to a new study published Friday in the journal Frontiers in Computer Science. “While users, unsurprisingly, engage more with the smartphone when it is easily accessible, the amount of time spent on work and non-work activities and the fragmentation of their workdays does not depend on the smartphone’s accessibility,” said study author Dr. Maxi Heitmayer, senior lecturer of psychology at the University of the Arts London and researcher and visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Related article
      One change I made to my social media use made a big difference on my mood To conduct his research, Heitmayer had a group of 22 people participate in two 5-hour computer-based work sessions: one with their smartphones nearby and the other with the phones outside their immediate reach. People tended to use the phone much more when it was in reach — but when they couldn’t get to it, they used their computers to distract from their work, according to the research. The study is small, so it’s difficult to draw big conclusions for the general population, said Dr. Noah Castelo, professor of consumer behavior at the University of Alberta. He was not involved in the research. But the results suggest that just banning phones from classrooms or workplaces may not necessarily solve the problem of distraction, and focusing on your habits and behaviors around technologies may be the best first step to solving for better attention, Heitmayer said. Distractions happen Most of the people who Heitmayer talks to say they don’t like how they use their phone or how much time they spend on it, he said, and that makes sense. Smartphones are designed to keep you interested, even when you want to be doing something else, he noted. “There is an open battle for your attention that is happening in your pocket,” he said. “I think these are the single best tools that we’ve invented. But also on there is the free software that harvests our attention.” But phones aren’t always the only problem. The world is filled with distractions, and often we go looking for them, Heitmayer said. “These disruptions, 89% of the time, it’s actually people themselves. It’s not the phone vibrating or lighting up or making a sound. It is you thinking, ‘Oh, I have missed something.’ And so, people check it,” he added, citing a study he conducted in 2021. Not having your attention on one thing all the time makes sense for survival. Monitoring the group and being aware of social dynamics has been a helpful and normal thing for humans evolutionarily, Heitmayer said. “We are not robots, and we are not going to be sitting down in front of the computer –– at least most of us –– and be narrowly focused for hours and hours and hours,” he said. “It seems that there is this appetite for distraction.” Taking breaks and shifting your attention may be helpful for a more productive workday. But if you aren’t aware of how your smartphone may be capturing your attention once you pick it up, he said you may find yourself scrolling when you’d rather get up and take a walk. Not having your phone within reach If you do want to spend less time on your phone, the best measure to take may be keeping it out of reach, according to the new research. When participants had their phone within reach, they spent almost twice as much time on it than when they had to get up and grab it. “Out of reach means you have to lift your butt,” Heitmayer said. “If you can kind of stretch, somehow, that would still be within reach. And then people would still use their phones.” After working with the phone out of reach, participants told Heitmayer there were more times they wanted to grab it, but that it was too far away. Related article
      What this teenager wants you to know about the damaging effects of AI The way that phones keep you hooked is different than an addiction, Heitmayer said: When you are addicted to a substance or to gambling, there tends to be a feeling that the longer you go without the thing you are addicted to, the more you need it. “With the phone, it is the exact opposite,” Heitmayer said. When you have it more, you use it more; and the more you use it, the longer you stay on it. Conversely, when you don’t have it, you engage in something else –– like a walk outside or a conversation with a friend –– and find you have forgotten about it, he said. How to address your phone habits Using your phone in a healthy way can be complicated. It’s not surprising that Dr. Paul Pavlou, dean of the Miami Herbert Business School at the University of Miami, found in his 2021 research that students with unlimited smartphone access had worse performance than when their phones were banned in the classroom. But the participating students did significantly better when they were instructed to use their phones to help with their learning. “Technology will be there, and I think we’re better off leveraging it as best as we can,” Pavlou, who was not involved in the new study, said. That take is Heitmayer’s viewpoint as well. “We have this device-centered narrative: ‘We are addicted to the phone, and the phone is the problem, and therefore someone else should take care of it for me,’” Heitmayer said. “It’s much harder, of course, to accept, ‘OK, actually, it’s my habits with this (device) that’s a problem.’” Limiting your screen time can be helpful in getting you to spend your leisure time in the way you really want to, Castelo said. His February study found that blocking internet from people’s phones caused them to spend more time doing things like exercising, socializing in person, pursuing hobbies and reading books. For better phone use, it’s important to become more literate about how your attention is being captured, Heitmayer said. For students, there is digital literacy education on predators online, scams to get their information, and spotting misinformation, but not much on learning to recognize when an app is designed to keep you engaged beyond your own interest, he added. What to say to your teens Jenny Anderson, journalist and coauthor of “The Disengaged Teen: Helping Kids Learn Better, Feel Better, and Live Better,” recommends checking in with teens about things like whether they remember what content they engaged with on their social media platforms was about, if they could track how long they were on, and if they noticed a point at which they were depleted rather than replenished by the scrolling. It is also essential to recognize that a societal pressure to be productive and avoid idleness can drive unwanted phone use, Heitmayer said. “We’ve all developed this absolute horror, almost, of being idle,” he said. “In public, when you stand there, everyone’s uncomfortable … when you’re on the phone, then it looks like you’re doing something.” There may not be an easy fix when it comes to limiting phone use and distractions, but simple steps such as knowing the social forces that push you to reach for your device and keeping your phone out of reach when you don’t want to be using it can help, Heitmayer said.",,0.2085898071527481
"Mega Millions is getting a makeover — including more than doubling the price of a ticket — as the multi-state lottery game aims to improve players’ odds and dish out bigger jackpots. The lottery, which is available to play in 45 states plus Washington, DC, and the US Virgin Islands, announced last year that changes were coming in April. Tonight marks the first drawing under the new format, with the jackpot growing to $54 million. Since the lottery launched in 2002, seven winners have won billion-plus jackpots — most recently in December, when a California resident won a $1.26 billion prize (or about $550 million in cash). But “beyond big jackpots, players told us they want bigger non-jackpot prizes and that’s exactly what this new game delivers,” said Joshua Johnston, lead director of the Mega Millions Consortium, in a press release. Now the big game, with drawings every Tuesday and Friday at 11 pm ET, is getting some major changes. Bigger price equals bigger prizes Arguably the biggest change is the price of a ticket, which now costs $5 — a large jump from $2. This is only the second price increase in the game’s 23 years, following 2017 when the price doubled to $2 from $1. Although it’s a steep increase, Mega Millions said that the higher ticket price will result in larger starting jackpots and faster-growing prizes. The lottery expects the average jackpot will be more than $800 million, much higher than the current $450 million average. For the lower-payout winners, there will no longer be “breakeven prizes” — meaning that every winning ticket will be more than the cost of a $5 ticket. That means players who would have won just $2 previously can now win between $10 to $50 under the revised format. Also, people who would have won $500 in the old game can now win significantly more money in the new version, ranging between $1,000 to $5,000. Despite the hefty price increase, Akshay Khanna, CEO of Jackpot.com, which sells Mega Millions tickets in seven states, told CNN that the lottery game’s customers often spend more than $5 when buying tickets. “While some customers may initially be surprised, we believe they’ll come to recognize the added benefits that this price increase enables,” said Khanna. “This vastly differs from something like a subway fare hike where you’re paying more for the same ride,” he added. “With this Mega Millions price increase, players are receiving improved odds alongside larger and faster-growing jackpots.” Changes to the game and better odds It’s not just ticket prices getting an overhaul. Mega Millions is tweaking the game itself. The game is removing one gold “Mega Ball” from the draw, which slightly improves the odds to win any prize from a 1 in 24 chance to 1 in 23. The overall odds of winning the entire Mega Millions jackpot also increases from 1 in 302.6 million, to 1 in 290.5 million. But the lottery is also eliminating some add-ons. That includes the “Megaplier,” a $1 add-on that increases non-jackpot payouts and is only available in some states. Also eliminated is “Just the Jackpot,” a $3 ticket that gives a player gets two plays to win the overall jackpot but not the lower-payout prizes. All of these modifications will be a net positive for the game, Khanna predicts. “The larger starting jackpots should attract more players,” he said, “ultimately increasing the prize amount at a faster rate to keep them engaged.”",,0.27604052424430847
"Springtime home shoppers may be feeling the impact of an intensifying trade war. The average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.83% in the week ending April 17, up from 6.62% a week ago, mortgage financing provider Freddie Mac said Thursday. That’s the largest one-week jump in mortgage rates in nearly a year. Interest rates on home loans had been steadily falling since March, which may have encouraged some prospective buyers to enter the market at the start of peak homebuying season. But President Donald Trump’s scattered approach to tariffs and an escalating trade war with China has injected volatility into the stock market, and resulted in a sell-off in US bonds last week. Mortgage rates track the benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield, which spiked as high as 4.5% last Wednesday. The 10-year has fallen slightly since then, trading at around 4.3% on Thursday. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate remains below the 7% level it had reached this time last year, though. “At this time last year, rates reached 7.1% while purchase application demand was 13% lower than it is today, a clear sign that this year’s spring homebuying season is off to a stronger start,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.",,0.22748373448848724

The company is now developing digital humans that can “listen” to people’s questions and converse in real time. “Shellie” can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while “Arif” is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. “What we’ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,” Sims tells CNN. “It becomes natural.” AI explosion Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI — artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. Related article
      Top soccer clubs are using an AI-powered app to scout future stars US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational “digital humans” that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways’ website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market. “When we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?” asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. “In some ways, we think of AI as something that’s helping us or augmenting our work,” she says. “However, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.” Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. “Every scenario that we found, we’re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,” she says. “Digital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,” adds Sims. “We’ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.”",,0.32726144790649414
"A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. “We’re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts’] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. “To say [to scouts], ‘Go over to this place today because there’s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard’ — that’s going to be the best use of your time.’” It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021. ‘It’s more about evolution’ Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the “lion’s share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. “It’s more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained. “We can’t tell you when that player’s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he’s 2-0 down? What happens when someone’s shouting at him? What happens when he’s just made a massive mistake?” Related article
      Apple launches its first sports app “We’ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you’re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.” While football remains ai.io’s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. “You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN.",,0.4745013117790222
"Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that “surging demand” for EVs over the next decade was set “to remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.” It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency’s bullish long-term outlook for EVs — based on current government policies — comes just days after the world’s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data “does not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,” he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. In a statement, Birol said: “Rather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.” Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world’s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company’s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China’s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the “pace of the transition to EVs… will hinge on affordability.” In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. “Intensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,” the IEA said. “Growing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,” it added.

      Tesla cuts prices in US, China and Germany as competition heats up Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. “China is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,” Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China’s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region’s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. “This shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,” Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

"Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That’s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon’s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. “The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia’s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. “Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund. “Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.” It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.” “A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. “This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.” There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. “Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said.",,0.23687222599983215
"Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases. When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia. Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person’s average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise. “The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. “Beyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.” Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ‘Methodical’ military spouse’s record-keeping deteriorates Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are “not remotely shocking.” Tidwell’s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since. Related article
      Class action suit alleges Raytheon discriminates against older job seekers Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an “outrageously methodical human being” who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military. After going through her mother’s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother’s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became “less than pristine.” For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. “There was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding — she knew things weren’t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.” Former finance executive accrues piles of unpaid bills, finances new car he didn’t need Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers. Related article
      You’ve retired. Can you get a mortgage — and should you? Her father was a former finance executive who “was very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,” she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest. Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn’t need, just months before police took away his driver’s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said. What’s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties. “I spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn’t paid them,” Lemay said. Two parents with dementia, one daughter’s efforts to reduce financial worry Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it. Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care. “The most challenging thing we faced was managing mum’s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn’t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone — a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,” Sibley said. Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked. Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father’s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care. While her mother’s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties. To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week’s worth of cash for their mother “but she’d spend it all in one go,” she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes. Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. “She wasn’t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That’s when we realized there has to be a better way.” With her husband, she founded Sibstar, which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person’s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). Early planning lessens some stress While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person’s finances when they become incapacitated. In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise. That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother’s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother’s bill paying online. “The time to make plans is before you need to. It’s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to ‘future me,’” said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother’s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably. Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia. Of course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. “I prepared as best as I could, but it’s still hard,” Tidwell said. That’s why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, “make the easy part easy.”",,0.19490379095077515
"A group of US businesses filed a lawsuit Monday arguing that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are illegal under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The suit was filed in the US Court of International Trade by the Liberty Justice Center, a legal advocacy group arguing on behalf of five businesses that it said have been “severely harmed” by the tariffs. The IEEPA gives the president the authority to impose emergency economic powers in response to an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to national security or the economy, criteria that the plaintiffs in this case say has not been met. The complaint also alleges that the law does not allow for the president to unilaterally impose tariffs. “No one person should have the power to impose taxes that have such vast global economic consequences,” Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, said in a statement. “The Constitution gives the power to set tax rates—including tariffs—to Congress, not the President.” In a statement to CNN, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said that trade deficits with other countries constitute a “national emergency.” “Never Trumpers will always oppose him, but President Trump is standing up for Main Street by putting an end to our trading partners—especially China—exploiting the U.S,” Fields said. “His plan levels the playing field for businesses and workers to address our country’s national emergency of chronic trade deficits.” This isn’t the first legal challenge to Trump’s sweeping tariffs. On April 3, the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), a civil rights group, filed a complaint arguing that the IEEPA does not allow a president to enact tariffs. The suit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida on behalf of Simplified, a Florida-based company that sells planners with materials imported from China. “By invoking emergency power to impose an across-the-board tariff on imports from China that the statute does not authorize, President Trump has misused that power, usurped Congress’s right to control tariffs, and upset the Constitution’s separation of powers,” Andrew Morris, senior litigation counsel at the NCLA, said in a statement announcing the Simplified suit.",,0.23649781942367554
"Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn’t be any different than shopping for a home. When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family’s needs and fall within your price range. “Adopt a mindset that we’re buying college like we’re buying a house,” said Beth Walker, author of “Buying College Better” and “Never Pay Retail for College.” As a financial adviser and certified college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies — and gets into — schools they cannot afford because the schools won’t give them enough aid. And then they just … try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family — so parents don’t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn’t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child’s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one “where a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.” Related article
      Your child got less college financial aid than you hoped. You’re not a bad parent if you don’t make up the difference In helping families align parents’ affordability constraints with their student’s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn’t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won’t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don’t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you’re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child’s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don’t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). “If you’re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don’t blow up your retirement,” he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you’re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child’s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you’re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don’t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt — including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans — to exceed 43%. Related article
      Many parents say they are still financially subsidizing their adult children If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. “If folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.  For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,” Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. “The student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,” Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum’s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you‘ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended “safety” schools or “reach” schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in.

      Emergency expenses will happen. Try these strategies if you don’t have the cash on hand Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge how competitive their profile is at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn’t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: “We have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.”",,0.26583459973335266
"US stocks rose Monday as traders rallied on the Trump administration’s exemption for tariffs on smartphones, computers and various electronics imported from China. The Dow rose 312 points, or 0.78%. The broader S&P 500 rose 0.79%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.64%. All three major indexes closed higher after a choppy day of trading. Stock indexes had opened higher before giving up some gains across the morning as a rally in tech stocks lost some steam. The Nasdaq rose as much as 2.4% in the morning before fluctuating between gains and losses midday and then gradually gaining. The Dow and the S&P 500 briefly dipped into the red midday before gaining in the afternoon. US stock futures had gained over the weekend after investors realized on Saturday that the Trump administration issued tariff exemptions for electronics imported from China, according to a US Customs and Border Protection notice posted late Friday. The exemptions come after President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed a tariff rate of 145% on imports from China. However, the exemptions do not apply to the 20% tariff on imports from China over the country’s role in the fentanyl trade. Apple (AAPL) rallied 2.2% Monday. While stocks gained, confusion lingers around the trade war with China: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday said the exemptions for electronics are only a temporary reprieve. Those products will face separate levies, according to Lutnick. “(Electronics are) exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC News on Sunday. In another back-and-forth, Trump said Monday he is considering a short-term tariff exemption for automakers. Trump’s 25% tariff on vehicles went into effect April 3 and tariffs on auto parts are slated to go into effect no later than May 3. Ford (F), Stellantis (STLA) and General Motors (GM) all surged more than 3% after Trump’s comments. “I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies where they’re switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places and they need a little bit more time,” Trump said during remarks at the White House. “They’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit more time.” The gains in US stocks followed rallies overseas. In Europe, the benchmark STOXX 600 gained 2.7%, while Germany’s DAX rose 2.85%. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 1.2%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 2.4%. Taiwan’s benchmark index edged lower by 0.08%, an outlier amid widespread gains. The gains in US stocks on Monday also came after new survey data from the New York Federal Reserve showed mounting pessimism among consumers about the short-term outlook for the economy. The New York Fed survey on Monday showed a sharp increase in respondents’ near-term inflation expectations, which jumped 0.5 percentage points to 3.6% — the highest reading in a year and a half. US stocks are coming off a wild two weeks. Trump’s rollout of his so-called “reciprocal tariffs” and subsequent 90-day pause on most “reciprocal” tariffs has sent US stocks on a roller coaster. The S&P 500 fell 9% across the first week of April, its worst week since 2020, before rallying 5.7% the second week of April, its best week since 2023. The stock market on Wednesday posted its third-biggest single-day gain in modern history after Trump announced a 90-day pause on most “reciprocal” tariffs. Despite the surge, the S&P 500 is still trading below its closing price on April 2, just before Trump initially announced the reciprocal tariffs. “The situation remains fluid, amid continuous twists and turns in developments since the ‘Liberation Day’ announcement less than two weeks ago,” analysts at UBS said in a Monday note. “But given the 90-day pause on ‘reciprocal’ tariffs and the latest electronics tariff reprieve, we expect the recovery in tech shares to continue.” Tariffs dampen Wall Street’s outlook for the economy Wall Street will look to continue a rally, although uncertainty is abound. The lack of clarity about Trump’s trade policy has kept traders in the dark about how to best position their investments — and raised concerns about US economic growth. “While any delay of tariffs is beneficial on the margin, it is not the same as their removal,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Friday note. “History suggests that elevated and prolonged uncertainty that weighs on business confidence can have detrimental effects on business spending and hiring.” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in an earnings press release Monday that the climate is a “markedly different operating environment than earlier this year.” “The prospect of a recession has increased with growing indications that economic activity is slowing down,” Solomon said on a call with analysts. “Our clients, including corporate CEOs and institutional investors, are concerned by the significant near-term and longer-term uncertainty that has constrained their ability to make important decisions.” Billionaire Ray Dalio over the weekend said Trump’s tariffs have helped push the US close to a recession — or perhaps even “something worse.” “Right now, we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession,” the hedge fund manager told NBC News Sunday. “And I’m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn’t handled well.” Analysts at Citi on Friday lowered their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,800 from 6,500, joining a group of Wall Street giants in cutting their forecasts for corporate earnings and growth this year amid an uncertain tariff environment. “No doubt, the goldilocks sentiment in place entering this year has given way to abject uncertainty,” analysts at Citi said in a Friday note. A major focus for investors this week will be the Treasury market, which is coming off a week so abnormally volatile that it spooked the White House and raised questions about whether US government debt is losing its status as a safe haven.

      The bond market is acting weird. It spooked Trump US Treasuries gained slightly on Monday and were relatively stable after broadly slumping last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note hovered around 4.38% Monday morning, after spiking above 4.5% on Friday. Yields and bond prices trade in opposite directions. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six foreign currencies, slid 0.4% on Monday and is coming off its biggest single-week decline since 2022. The dollar has broadly weakened this year amid concerns about waning investor confidence in the United States. US oil on Monday settled 3 cents higher at $61.53 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, settled 12 cents higher at $64.88 a barrel. Oil largely held steady after OPEC in a monthly report slightly lowered its forecast for global oil demand growth this year, citing the impact of tariffs. Meanwhile, gold was down 0.8% on Monday after surpassing a record high $3,200 a troy ounce on Friday. The yellow metal has soared more than 21% this year as investors flock to safe havens. Analysts at Goldman Sachs on Friday raised their year-end price forecast for gold to $3,700, underpinning the heightened demand for bullion amid economic uncertainty.

"Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation. Now that inflation has slowed substantially and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September. If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others. Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response. Timing and magnitude matter The prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads. But, realistically, how much you’ll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time. The answer for the near term is most likely to be “not that much.” “Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. By that he means: “Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],” McBride said. “And for savers, [the initial declines] won’t wipe out your interest earnings. Savers will still be way ahead of the game.” That’s because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year won’t meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs. But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then. “Don’t jump the gun too early on this stuff,” said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning. Here’s a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it. Your home Getting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make. Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fed’s moves are one. Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay. For those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate. Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. That’s because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance. To buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher — they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree. Given that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25% in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over 2% or 3%, Diodato sees it this way: “Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn’t stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.” As for taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it’s no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won’t make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. “Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesn’t make it free money.” Of course, if you’re just taking out a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted. And if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, “aggressively pay it down. It’s high-cost debt that won’t get cheaper soon.” Your credit cards Another perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balances. A few rate cuts won’t make much of a dent in today’s record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if rate cuts ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 — 16.3% — it will still be a pricey loan. That’s why, if you’re carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe. If that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. “They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,” Dodiato said. Your car If you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year. “Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you’re financing and your credit rating,” he said. As for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called “money factor” you will pay to lease, and because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates. Your savings The past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts, many of which have been paying north of 5%. The same goes for those who could lock up their cash for certain periods of time in certificates of deposits or Treasuries, many durations of which were also paying north of 5%. While those rates will start to come down when the Fed starts cutting rates, the drops aren’t likely to be huge at first — meaning you will still be able to earn more on your savings than the rate of inflation for a while, McBride predicts.

      Make your money work when you’re not: Creating an income-producing portfolio But it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward. “I caution people against the cash trap. A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,” said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years. His advice: Don’t keep more than six months’ to a year’s worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents. “Anything more than that and you’re putting a drag on your future net worth,” he said. That said, McBride suggested that if you’re within five years of retirement, you might want to lock in some high rates still on offer today to grow the cash you’ll want to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you won’t be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement. For instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for such a longer-term CD, try to find one that is not “callable.” A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years. “The call feature is a ‘Heads I win, tails you lose’ for the issuing bank,” McBride said.",,0.1658097505569458
"Editor’s Note: This is an updated version of an article that first ran on April 13. It’s April 15 — otherwise known as “Tax Day” in the United States. While the IRS has already received a majority of the 2024 federal income tax returns typically filed by Tax Day — 101.422 million as of April 4, to be precise — US tax filers are expected to send in tens of millions more by today. But the agency also expects to receive millions more returns in the months ahead due to the automatic extensions the IRS granted to people in federally declared disaster areas. At current count, all residents and businesses in seven states have already been granted filing and payment extensions, on top of people in select areas of other states. More on that below. Plus, millions of individual filers have requested — or will request today — automatic six-month filing extensions because they won’t make the April 15 deadline. If you are racing to file your return today — or think you won’t make it in time — here are some last-minute tips to keep in mind. Get all your documents in order If you’re starting cold, make sure you pull together all the documents you’ll need to fill out your return. You’ll want to look for income reporting forms from your employer (a W-2 for your earnings) or from your clients if you’re self-employed as a freelancer or contractor (a 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC). Related article
      Heads up if you’re a freelancer or small business owner: The IRS may need something new from you You may even get a 1099-K from any payment apps you use like Venmo if you received payments for your goods or services. If you are receiving any income distributions from an IRA or pension, you should have a 1099-R. Also look for other 1099 forms from your bank and brokerage for other types of income you received during the year (e.g., interest, dividends and capital gains). All these forms will have been sent to you by mail, electronically or both. Consider, too, any major changes that took place in your life in 2024 that could affect your taxes either through new tax breaks or new types of reportable income — for instance, if you got married, had children, received alimony, started a small business on the side, bought or sold a home, inherited an IRA or collected unemployment benefits. Figure out if you should itemize deductions Most filers now take the standard deduction — a flat amount you deduct from your income ($14,600 for single filers and those who are married filing separately; $29,200 for married couples filing jointly; and $21,900 for head-of-household filers). But if the standard deduction amounts to less than the total of the value of itemized deductions you’re eligible to take (e.g., state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, etc.) you might want to itemize. If you do, gather the documentation you will need to back up those deductions (e.g. a Form 1098 for mortgage interest from your lender, contribution receipts from charities, etc.). See if this 11th hour tax break is right for you Speaking of deductions, if you qualify to deduct contributions to a traditional tax-deferred IRA, you can put away up to $7,000 ($8,000 if you’re 50 or older) by 11:59 pm on April 15 and still have it count as your 2024 contribution. Since it’s an “above-the-line deduction” you’re allowed to take it even if you claim the standard deduction. Here are the eligibility rules if you have a retirement plan at work and if you don’t. Consider using the free Direct File program If you have a fairly straightforward tax situation with a household income below $250,000, and if you take the standard deduction and only a handful of credits pertaining mostly to family, you may be eligible to use the IRS’ free Direct File program. (Here’s how to figure out if it would be right for you.) The Direct File option is currently available in 25 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The program works on mobile phones, laptops, tablets or desktop computers. And it will help guide you to fill out your state tax return, too. You also can file for free using one of several private-sector tax preparation software programs approved by the IRS. These free filing options, however, are for those with adjusted gross incomes of $84,000 or less. Other eligibility criteria may apply. No matter how you file, do this Whether you’re preparing your return on your own, working with a tax preparer or using Direct File, you always want to double check that everything is correct on your return before submitting it. Dopey little mistakes — getting a number wrong, misspelling your name, selecting the wrong filing status, etc. — can hold up the processing of your return. And if you’re due a refund, those errors could delay that money getting to you. If possible, electronically file your return, which is generally considered to be safer and faster, according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service. What to do if you can’t file by 11:59 pm tonight While April 15 is the deadline for most US tax filers, there are certain groups of filers whose official due date is later this year, such as people living and working in certain federally declared disaster areas. This now includes all the residents and businesses operating in seven states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. It also includes some US citizens living abroad; and military members stationed outside the US or in a combat zone. But if you’re not among any of those groups and you really can’t file your taxes today, do these three things before 11:59 p.m. local time tonight: Related article
      Thinking you might not file your tax return? Reconsider, if you want to save money 1. File for an automatic six-month filing extension here. 2. If you think you still owe money to the IRS for tax year 2024, it must be paid by Tuesday, even if you request a filing extension. One way to ballpark whether you still do is to multiply your 2024 income by 20% and make sure that you have already paid that much, according to Tom O’Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Professionals. If you haven’t, send the IRS the difference. 3. Send that payment no later than 11:59 pm tonight. If you’re mailing it, do so by certified mail, so you’ll have confirmation that it was sent and received. If you can’t pay all that you owe, pay however much you can by April 15, then explore the various payment agreements you can make with the IRS. If you don’t file and haven’t requested an extension — or if you don’t pay the rest of what you owe the IRS for 2024 today — you may be subject to a failure-to-file penalty equal to 5% of the balance you owe plus interest for every month you don’t file; and/or a failure-to-pay penalty equal to to 0.5% of what you owe plus interest every month until you pay in full.",,0.23555588722229004
"Starbucks is updating its uniform policy, emphasizing the appearance of its recognizable “green aprons” as part of CEO Brian Niccol’s broader plans to revive the slumping brand. Beginning May 12, baristas at stores in North America will have to wear solid black tops under their aprons, a change from employees being allowed to wear any colored shirt, in an attempt to “allow our iconic green apron to shine and create a sense of familiarity for our customers,” Starbucks said in a release. The company is also tweaking pant colors, with employees soon to be required to wear khaki, black or blue denim, a change from being allowed to wear navy, gray or brown. The coffee chain has been looking for ways to bring customers back into stores. Starbucks’ sales have slipped for four straight quarters, the longest decline in years. Some customers stopped going to Starbucks because of high prices for drinks and long wait times, and hundreds of its stores have voted to unionize to push for better pay, benefits and working conditions. Starbucks said the dress code changes will help it “deliver a more consistent coffeehouse experience that will also bring simpler and clearer guidance to our partners, which means they can focus on what matters most, crafting great beverages and fostering connections with customers.” Workers United, a union representing some Starbucks employees, criticized the change, saying in a statement that the company should focus on collective bargaining instead. “Starbucks’ top priority should be finalizing fair contracts with union baristas so we have the staffing, guaranteed hours, and support we need to do our jobs. Workers United has written to Starbucks demanding no dress code change be implemented at union-represented stores until bargaining concludes,” said Jasmine Leli, a barista and an union bargaining delegate. Other changes It’s just the latest change that Niccol has initiated at Starbucks. Earlier this year, the chain eliminated a significant number of drink and food options as part of an overhaul to cut 30% of its menu to help reduce wait times. It also axed 1,000 corporate positions. He’s also reimagined the vibe inside Starbucks’ locations by instituting a new policy restricting restrooms to paying customers. Plus, it tweaked its name to “Starbucks Coffee Company” to reinforce its coffee roots. Niccol has also brought back a company tradition of baristas doodling on cups, as well as self-serve milk and sugar stations. Niccol admitted in the company’s most recent earnings call that there’s “still room for improvement,” but he’s confident that Starbucks is “on the right track.” Since he took the helm last September, Niccol has rolled out a series of changes that have received a “positive response” from customers. Starbucks will give a glimpse if these changes are working in its next earnings report in the coming weeks.",,0.2587170898914337
"Sign up for CNN’s Adulthood, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has tips to help you make more informed decisions around personal finance, career, wellness and personal connections. Megan Rathmell thought she’d bombed her job interview earlier this year, assuming her nervousness and lack of preparation had cost her the opportunity. The 20-year-old later found out she got the job as a paralegal — and what made her stand out was her ability to do two important things: maintain eye contact and carry on a conversation. “My boss told me that I was a good communicator and that I was able to make strong eye contact, and that he hasn’t seen this from a lot of my peers,” said Rathmell, who is based in Virginia. “That was really surprising to me.” What Rathmell learned from her boss mirrors what hiring managers say: Some Gen Z college graduates are unprepared for job interviews or behave unprofessionally during job interviews. They bring parents to in-person interviews, refuse to turn the camera on during virtual interviews, use inappropriate language, dress unprofessionally and struggle to make eye contact. While there have always been people who interviewed badly for jobs, “it does seem to be more prevalent today,” said Dr. Nathan Mondragon, chief innovation officer at the hiring platform HireVue. There could be several factors contributing to the problem. The digital age has made many people less experienced with in-person interactions and therefore less comfortable with them especially challenging ones. Pandemic safety precautions only made that worse, Mondragon said. And while some parents are overinvolved in their child’s professional pursuits, others aren’t teaching them how to navigate the professional world without parental handholding. Related article
      5 ways to be a better adult this year Some people think they can just wing a job interview, said Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder. But just like anything else you want to be successful at, getting a job also requires preparation. There will be plenty of competition for those jobs, as new employment data released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday shows. The number of employed people increased by 254,000 in September, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, according to BLS data on nonfarm payroll employment. (That excludes people working as farmers, nonprofit or private household employees, and more.) There are about 6.8 million people who currently want a job — so here’s what you should do before, during and after an interview to stand out and get the job you want. Before you get an interview, you need to stand out from hundreds of other applicants, and you have about six seconds to catch a recruiter’s eye using your resume, Haller said. Therefore, your resume should be one compelling, clear and uncrowded page that is tailored to the position and highlights why you’re the best candidate. Be careful who you get advice from, Haller said. If you know other people who work at the company or in similar industries, consulting them could be good. Parents and other people their age, however, likely have good intentions but may have not interviewed for a job in decades or ever worked in your industry, and the workforce is different now. Unless you’ve gone to a specialty school, your college or graduate school career center may not have employees with any experience in hiring people, so it’s not always helpful, Haller said. Look the career center employees up online to see if they have a relevant track record. Do your research One of the biggest mistakes some interviewees make is asking questions about things they could have easily found by looking at just the homepage of a company’s website, said Dr. Nicolas Roulin, professor of industrial/organizational psychology at Saint Mary’s University in Canada. That, as well as not asking any questions at all, tells the interviewer you haven’t done your homework and probably don’t care about the job. Related article
      Your work schedule as a young adult may harm your health decades later, study finds Thoroughly research the company, experts said. You must be able to answer the question, “Why do you want to work here?” and express how you can contribute to the company’s values, culture, strategies, goals and more. By researching the interviewers, as well — if you have their names — you can ask them more in-depth questions about their job, goals and lives, and you may even find you have a fun personal connection to bring up, such as having attended the same school. Websites such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor can help you find some of this information. Glassdoor reviews are typically left by current or former employees. Write down your answers in advance During the interview, you’ll also need to demonstrate how well you fit, and can perform, the job description. You can prepare by writing down your success stories for each requirement within that description, using the STAR technique. That acronym stands for situation, task, action and result — define the situation, what task needed to be accomplished, what actions you took alone or as part of a team to do so, and what the results were. Prepare your questions Your questions are just as important as your answers, and they should show interest, motivation and care, as well as what’s important to you, experts said. Here are some examples, which you can practice on your own or in mock interviews with friends or family: If you struggle with nervousness before interviews, relaxation or breathing techniques can help, Roulin said. Experiencing more severe anxiety may require therapy. Related article
      How to stop using alcohol as a confidence crutch Dressing professionally for both in-person and virtual interviews is important regardless of whether it’s for a fast-food restaurant, retail store or office job, experts said. Business casual is usually best — no jeans, shorts, flip-flops or overly revealing clothing. If the company culture is more casual, that doesn’t automatically mean you should dress like them for your interview, Haller said. Those employees have already had the chance to show over time that they do great work despite how they’re dressed, but they don’t know you yet. You need to make a good impression that shows you’re respectful and serious. At the same time, don’t go overboard by wearing a three-piece suit and appearing totally out of touch, Haller said — unless that’s the dress code. Bring all those notes you prepared to the interview, but don’t bring your parents. That can imply immaturity and incapability, and you’re the one who needs to be able to do the job without them. Where you do the interview is also important. The setting should be as distraction- and noise-free as possible, so avoid conducting it from a public space, such as a coffeeshop. Turning your camera off is generally inappropriate, experts said, and it can suggest you’re hiding something or uncomfortable dealing with people — which is obviously a concerning red flag since most jobs require dealing with people. READ MORE: Life lessons from 6 money and lifestyle coaches If you don’t have an answer for a question, ask the interviewer to rephrase or say “I don’t have much experience with that particular issue, but I can tell you about a time when X.” You can also say you would like an opportunity to really think about the question if they would let you get back to them with an answer. These alternatives show you’re adaptable, and they allow you to show off in other ways. When you’re given the chance to ask questions, ask what you’ve prepared. But save questions about salary, availability expectations and vacation benefits for a point towards the end of the interview, Mondragon said. These questions are important for your survival and quality of life, something Gen Z cares more about than previous generations — which is a great thing, he added. Some states, such as Colorado and New York, have even required that job postings state the salary. But you don’t want to appear to care more about not working than working. How you ask also matters. “Can you tell me about the company’s benefits packages for employees at this level?” sounds better than “How many days off do I get?” Related article
      The boredom scroll on socials may be making your problem worse, study says At the end, ask if there’s anything else you could provide to show you’re a great candidate for the position, Haller said. “You want to overcome any objections. And then you always want to ask about the next steps and express your interest.” Within 24 hours after the interview, email a thank you note expressing gratitude for the interviewer’s time and the opportunity, Haller said. But know that your message is more than a thank you note — it’s also an indirect reminder to hire you. If you get a call for another interview or a job offer, respond as immediately as possible, experts said. Even if you’re no longer interested, you should still quickly communicate that, too — it’s the respectful thing to do, and you don’t want to burn any bridges you may need to cross again in the future. Do not follow up with an employer about whether there’s any news before the time they said they’ll be in touch, Roulin said. After that is when you can check in once a week. If a month or two go by, no response from them is your answer, Haller said — and you shouldn’t work for companies that treat people that way.

"Tesla has settled a racial discrimination lawsuit by a Black female employee who claimed a manager at its Fremont, California, plant sometimes greeted workers by saying “welcome to the plantation” or “welcome to the slave house.” Raina Pierce, who installed latches on car doors, and the automaker led by billionaire Elon Musk agreed to a settlement proposed by a mediator, according to a joint filing Thursday in San Francisco federal court. Terms were not disclosed, and both sides are finalizing a settlement agreement, the filing said. Lawyers for Pierce and Tesla (TSLA) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk is not a defendant. Pierce said she was subjected to pervasive harassment, including a common racial slur she said was scrawled throughout the plant including in bathrooms, and a gender-based insult. She also said she was yelled at or disciplined for conduct for which non-Black workers were excused. Pierce’s complaint quotes a Tesla employee who temporarily joined her production line and said, “Ma’am, you need to go to HR because these leads are saying things about you that are not right.” Tesla has faced other accusations of racial discrimination and harassment at the Fremont plant.

"If you’ve received a text claiming you owe unpaid tolls, you’re not alone. Over 60,000 complaints were made to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center last year about unpaid toll scams. People all over the country are being contacted, mostly via text messages, and being told they owe money for highway tolls. Some of these texts appear to come from phone numbers that appear real but feature fake email addresses. “The texts may include a link that looks like it’s from the state’s toll service and may include a phone number,” according to the FBI. Consumer protection service McAfee found scam texts nearly quadrupled from January to late February this year. Steve Grobman, executive vice president and chief technology officer at McAfee, said the toll scam is effective because it hits all the correct social points for a consumer. “They’re able to use the recipient’s location anything from as simple as their area code, but also with a lot of the data breaches over the last few years, they know physically where people live or have lived, and can then target them with location-relevant toll scam,” Grobman said. McAfee found that 76% of messages from January and February had links, many using URL shorteners like bit.ly to hide where links actually go. These scam websites also use domains like “.vip,” “.top,” and “.xin” to trick people into thinking they are official websites. Massachusetts resident Caroline Holland thought she was getting ahead of the toll scams she had seen on the news. When Holland got texts claiming to be from her state’s Department of Transportation, she assumed it was a scam, much like the over 60,000 complaints made to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center last year about unpaid toll scams. “I saw a couple, and I was like, ‘I’ve read about this scam. I’m not going to fall for it. I’m a little bit more aware than that,’” Holland, 37, explained. “I got a few more and I didn’t really read them super closely.” But just a few months after Holland ignored the texts, she had a letter in the mail from a collection agency stating she hadn’t paid her tolls. Her credit card had expired for her EZDriveMA account, Massachusetts tolling program, and some of the texts she was receiving turned out to be legitimate. CNN reached out to Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and it denied the department would send texts. However, when Holland’s situation was explained, the DOT replied: EZDriveMA will utilize text messages to notify account holders regarding issues with their account, such as a low prepaid balance, a declined or expired credit card on file, or a malfunctioning transponder. These messages direct customers to the EZDriveMA Customer Service Center, and do not include links. EZDriveMA will never request payment via text. Holland may be one of the few exceptions to the scam. She has since paid the balance and everything has settled. Much like Holland’s case, where she received both legitimate and scam texts, the scammers have also looked up matching names of real toll systems near or in a consumer’s area. Recent McAfee research shows that the average American sees an average of 14 scam messages and deepfakes on social media, via text and email, daily. “People need to recognize that scammers are trying to create situations that create fear, anxiety and a sense of urgency,” Grobman said. How to avoid being a victim of toll scams The FBI urges people to be cautious of clicking links in text messages, even if they appear to come from a “trusted source.” “Remember that companies generally don’t contact you to ask for your username or password,” guidance from the FBI states. “Don’t click on anything in an unsolicited email or text message. Look up the company’s phone number on your own (don’t use the one a potential scammer is providing) and call the company to ask if the request is legitimate.” The FBI also warns about downloads and urges people to be careful. Should you have clicked on anything or provided your information, set up ways to secure your personal information and financial accounts. The FBI also encourages people to report suspicious text messages to the Internet Crime Complaint Center and any appropriate authorities.",,0.20142175257205963
"President Donald Trump is forging ahead with his aggressive tariff campaign, moving on from “reciprocal” tariffs to the sector-specific tariffs he promised. To do so will involve Trump’s continued application of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows a president to impose tariffs to protect or bolster domestic industries if there are deemed potential national security threats. What used to be a rarely employed trade provision has been a favorite instrument in Trump’s trade tool box during his two terms. The Commerce Department previously launched Section 232 probes into copper and lumber. And earlier this month, the administration started investigating pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, according to Federal Register filings made public on Monday. In addition to those active investigations, which have to be completed within 270 days after they began, the Trump administration has indicated plans to launch similar probes for critical minerals. “The risk from (imposing duties) on imports of products where there are few substitutes is certainly greater, and that’s why there have been some exemptions and reductions in tariffs and exclusions of products that are of key importance to the US,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN in an interview. There have been notable exclusions from the slew of tariffs imposed by Trump, including goods compliant under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement; the products undergoing or in the pipeline for Section 232 probes; and, just within the past few days, the exclusion of smartphones, computer monitors and other electronics from the 145% “reciprocal” tariff on Chinese imports. The tech products exemption is intended to be temporary, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Sunday, indicating that they’ll be wrapped into the forthcoming semiconductor tariffs. Although the Trump administration has softened some of its tariff plans, the US economy is still expected to slow and be put on a “recession watch,” Daco said. His firm estimates that the increased cost of imports will lead to higher prices, accelerated inflation and reduced economic activity both in the US and abroad. “When you think about your trade policy, you want to be very careful not to exercise an extreme degree of pressure via higher prices on these sectors, and that’s why so far there have been the exemptions and exclusions that we’ve seen,” Daco added. “It’s because there’s a gradual realization that imposing a tax on imports of those critical products eventually hurts US businesses and hurts US consumers and therefore leads to lower economic activity.” Still, there are added risks from the haphazard nature by which they’ve been announced and applied, Daco added: Depressed consumer and business confidence leads to hesitation on spending and investment, while the heightened volatility of financial markets and depressed stocks result in negative earnings and wealth. “We don’t know what will be announced tomorrow, or what will be the trade policy landscape in a few weeks time, a few months time,” Daco said. “And so it’s very difficult to calibrate any type of forecast with any sense of precision.” Alongside those near- and longer-term headwinds, tariffs could have unique impacts on each sector being evaluated under Section 232: Related article
      China has a powerful card to play in its fight against Trump’s trade war: rare earths Copper and critical minerals: It’s not yet known which minerals the US could consider investigating under Section 232; however, an investigation is already underway on copper — a critical cog in the ongoing electrification of America and industries such as defense. The US imports about 50% of the copper it uses, and demand is only expected to grow, especially as energy-consuming industries such as artificial intelligence and blockchain boom, Dan Ikenson, economist and trade policy scholar at Ikenomics Consulting, told CNN. “It takes 16, 17, 18 years to get the licenses for mines and permits for refining,” he said. “Since we don’t have those resources, and we’re dependent on the world for it, we should not be agitating and looking to pick trade fights, we should be working out arrangements where we can have long-term access to Canada’s exports, Chile’s and Peru’s.” Lumber: Softwood lumber is a critical and preferred ingredient for homebuilding, and 30% of it is imported by the US. Homebuilders warn that tariffs on softwood lumber and other materials could further exacerbate the housing affordability crisis. Higher costs of lumber imports could also affect other products, such as furniture and even toilet paper. The Trump administration, to bolster the US lumber industry, recently ordered that half of America’s national forests be opened up for logging — a move criticized for its potential negative effects on the environment, species, watersheds and recreation. Trump has frequently quipped that the US doesn’t need to import items like lumber, cars and oil, claiming that natural resources and manufacturing potential are plentiful enough domestically for America to be self-sufficient. Economists, researchers and other experts have frequently warned that it’s not that simple: It takes years for manufacturing facilities to be built, supply chains to be established, and skilled workforces to be trained. (Plus, the construction of those new facilities would likely require imported materials that now are coming at a premium.) Pharmaceuticals: Tariffs here present conflicting policy goals for Trump, who has stated he wants to bring down the prices of pharmaceutical products and bolster US manufacturing, Diederik Stadig, health care sector economist for ING, wrote in a post last week. “While some branded production might gradually be shifted to the US, a big increase in generic production is unlikely,” he said, noting that the construction of new facilities takes roughly 10 years. Tariffs also have an inflationary effect, which would drive up health care costs and hamper the affordability of medication, especially for people without insurance: Under a 25% tariff, commonly prescribed drugs could increase from 82 cents per pill to 94 cents a pill, or roughly $42 more per year, he wrote. More complex prescriptions, such as those for cancer treatment, could jump even higher, he wrote, estimating that a 24-week prescription could see additional costs in the $8,000 to $10,000 range. Tariffs also have the potential to impact the availability of pharmaceutical products, Johnson & Johnson CEO Joaquin Duato said during the company’s earnings call on Tuesday. “Tariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain, leading to shortages,” Duato said. “If what you want is to build manufacturing capacity in the US, both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals, the most effective answer is not tariffs but tax policy.” To mitigate any potential impacts, Duato noted that he believes it’s important for health care firms such as his to work with the government to ensure there’s enough manufacturing capacity in the US. Semiconductors: Medical devices, Wi-Fi routers, laptops, smartphones, cars, household appliances and LED lightbulbs are just a few examples of where semiconductor chips are found. And these products often don’t just require one or two. For instance, new cars contain thousands of them. Put another way, semiconductor chips are “the crude oil of the 21st century.” And it has become glaringly obvious what happens when that oil runs dry: As a side effect of the pandemic, a chip shortage put cars and other products in short supply and fanned the flames of inflation. Although the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act passed during the Biden administration helped incentivize chipmakers like TSMC to open US facilities, even if tariffs do spur more domestic chip production, America still lacks electronic assembly capabilities, John Dallesasse, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, previously told CNN. Because of that, any chips produced in the US would still have to be shipped abroad to places like Taiwan, South Korea, China or Mexico to be put into the finished electronics Americans buy, and those would be subject to tariffs.

"There could very soon be a new biggest credit card company in the United States. Capital One (COF) received approval from the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to acquire and merge with Discover Financial Services (DFS), the agencies announced Friday. As a condition of the approval, Capital One must provide the OCC with a plan “to address the underlying root causes of any outstanding enforcement actions against Discover Bank and plans for remediation of harm.” The all-stock deal, first announced over a year ago, would give Capital One a major leg up against competing credit card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), which don’t process transactions themselves. It would also give Capital One a new source of revenue from the merchant fees it collects. For existing Discover customers, the move could increase merchant acceptance rates. But there’s also a risk that they could face higher credit card interest rates. Compared to other major credit card issuers, Capital One has historically catered to customers with credit scores in the 600s range, which is considered subprime. Given these borrowers are considered riskier, they tend to get charged higher interest rates compared to higher-scoring individuals. In signing off on the deal, the Fed announced it entered into a consent order with Discover and charged Discover a $100 million penalty “for overcharging certain interchange fees from 2007 through 2023.” Under the Biden administration, the prospects of the deal receiving approval from the Department of Justice were much slimmer, given the administration’s overall antitrust stance. But the Trump administration has largely been seen as being much more merger friendly. Immediately after President Donald Trump’s November victory last year, shares of Capital One and Discover rose, as well as shares of other companies that were attempting to merge — or which had previously called off deals altogether.",,0.4690980613231659

"Before you hop out the door this Easter Sunday, ﻿it may be worth checking what’s open as some places aren’t cracking their doors. Easter falls on April 20 this year. While it’s not a federal holiday, it’s widely observed across the United States, and many businesses either close or shorten their hours. A﻿ccording to the National Retail Federation, Americans are expected to shell out $23.6 billion on Easter celebrations. So whether you’re hunting for last-minute groceries, grabbing a bite to eat or planning to just enjoy the day, here’s what’s open (and closed) this Easter Sunday. Retail and grocery stores Walmart, Kroger’s, Food Lion, Wegmans and Trader Joe’s (except for one store in Portland, Maine) will all be open during regular hours. Still, it’s best to double-check with your local store, as hours could vary. Several major retailers will be closed for the holiday, including Target, Aldi, Lowe’s and Best Buy. Warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam’s Club will also shut their doors for the day. Shoppers hoping to browse clothing or home goods will also have to wait — TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Burlington and JCPenney will all be closed on Easter. Restaurants Most major fast-food chains like McDonald’s, Taco Bell and Wendy’s will be open on Easter Sunday, but hours can vary depending on the location. Sit-down favorites like Cracker Barrel, Olive Garden and Golden Corral will be open during their regular hours. Chains like Applebee’s, IHOP and Panera Bread may have adjusted schedules, so it’s a good idea to call ahead or check online. Some popular spots, including Zaxby’s, Chipotle, CAVA, Raising Cane’s and In-N-Out, will be closed for the holiday. Financial services Most banks will be closed on Easter Sunday, although that’s not out of the ordinary since many do not operate on Sundays. Online and mobile banking services will still be available. Markets are always closed on the weekends. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will trade on Monday as usual.

Most FedEx services also won’t be available, though FedEx offices will be open on modified hours and Custom Critical will be available.",,0.36691734194755554
"It’s called a chicken tax, but it’s levied on pickups. And it shows just why President Donald Trump’s tariffs could change the US economy longer than you might think. President Lyndon Johnson imposed the chicken tax in 1963, but it’s still in effect today, even though its supposed reason for existence is, well, no longer in existence. The import tax’s longevity, though, underscores how tariffs can reshape global markets, sometimes well past the conditions they were put in place to address. Trump’s trade war could change the way Americans and the world shops and buys for generations to come. To this day, the chicken tax essentially prevents automakers from selling pickup trucks made in Europe or Asia in America. Most US pickups are built in North America, leading to massive profits for US automakers but less choice and higher prices for millions of American buyers, as well as some impressively convoluted maneuvers by automakers to try to get around the tax. “Trump seems to think he can announce very high tariffs and then them dial back. But tariffs changes economic incentives,” said Dan Ikenson, an economist and former director of international trade at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. “Constituencies develop and they take on a life of their own, and that’s why they’re long lived.” A trade war older than most Americans The chicken tax started, unsurprisingly, with chickens. In 1962, European countries tariffed American chicken, practically shutting US poultry producers out of the lucrative and growing market in Europe. Soon after Johnson took office in 1963, he imposed “retaliatory” tariffs on a number of European products, including trucks. At the time, only a sliver of US car sales were imports and few Americans had even heard of Toyota or Honda. The 25% tariffs on “motor vehicles for the transport of goods” was primarily to punish German automaker Volkswagen, which was the only foreign automaker making inroads into the US market at that time. There were also US tariffs on potato starch, dextrin and brandy, three other products important to European exporters. But the American beneficiaries of those tariffs didn’t have nearly the political clout as the auto industry, Ikenson said. By cutting out foreign competition, the chicken tax opened the door for America’s “Big Three” automakers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, to raise prices on their trucks. Prices of American built trucks, though not subject to the tariffs, rose about 5% to 6% a year while car prices rose only 2% a year, according to preliminary analysis of car and truck prices by Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. Bigger profits meant US automakers focused more on producing trucks. So even when Europe dropped the tax on American chickens in 1964, the Big Three and the auto workers union flexed their considerable muscle to keep the imports on foreign trucks in place, Smoke said. “It was never challenged or questioned politically,” said Smoke. Few, if any, truck buyers realize the tax meant they were paying higher prices, Smoke added. And since it spurred American production, “the average American would say this isn’t a bad thing.” The chicken tax even survived numerous rounds of global trade agreements aimed at promoting free trade, including the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995. That’s because once the tariffs are in place, they tend to stay in place, says Lawrence Friedman, a global trade attorney. For example, there are still tariffs on televisions with cathode ray tubes – the big, bulky kind that have fallen out of favor in place of flatscreens – and ones with built-in VCR players. Trick or tariff But with trade restrictions comes the search for loopholes. Such practices are common in the complex world of trade rules and tariffs, said Friedman. The term in the trade industry is “tariff engineering.” To get around the chicken tax, some foreign automakers shipped trucks to the United States without the truck beds attached to the chassis. Others added extra seats so that the trucks were classified as passenger vehicles. The Subaru BRAT added two rear facing seats in its truck bed. And it wasn’t only the foreign automakers who played games to avoid the chicken tax. Between 2009 and 2013, Ford, which was building the Transit Connect van in Europe, shipped them to the US with additional seats that would be removed once they cleared customs. The Department of Justice eventually fined Ford $365 million in 2024 over the issue. However, it was the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, that really opened a legal route around the chicken tax. NAFTA opened the trade borders with Canada and Mexico, so automakers were soon building trucks destined for the US market both north and south of the border. General Motors, for example, builds its best-selling truck, the Silverado, in Canada and Mexico as well as the United States. With pickups taxed, foreign automakers think small With pickup imports taxed, many Asian and European automakers turned to a different (less-tariffed) niche: cars. Especially smaller, more fuel-efficient economy cars. The timing was on their side. With gas prices rising in the early 1970s, Americans flocked to those kinds of autos. When foreign brands began building US plants, starting with a Honda plant in Ohio in 1982, they concentrated first on cars, not trucks. However, foreign brands didn’t build US factories because of the chicken tax, but because it was cheaper to build closer to where the cars would ultimately be sold. “The tariff is not that much of an inducer of foreign direct investment the way we thought,” said Ikenson. “There was a ton of investment coming in to produce cars, and the tariff on them was only 2.5%.” Even with the combination of shutting out foreign pickups and Americans’ love of trucks, the Big Three’s overall share of the US auto market has continued to shrink these last 60 years. By 2007, Asian and European brands captured a majority of US combined car and truck sales over the traditional Big Three automakers for the first time, according to companies’ sales reports. Though the Big Three still dominate truck sales, they now only account for 38% of overall US auto sales, producing fewer vehicles at their US plants last year – 4.6 million – than the 4.9 million built by foreign automakers, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. How Trump’s tariffs change the market, and how long they stay, is tough to say, said Cox Automotive’s Smoke. But however long they last, the chicken tax shows that undoing tariffs is never that simple. And even when tariffs raise car prices and cost more auto jobs than they create, the idea behind them is a powerful narrative, Smoke said. “I wouldn’t be surprised that this one example of tariff that Americans end up supporting,” he said.",,0.21659326553344727
"Ryan Coogler’s supernatural horror “Sinners” drove a stake through the competition this weekend to finish No. 1 at the box office while shattering industry expectations. “Sinners” pulled in $45.6 million domestically, surpassing estimates of about $35 million, and edging “A Minecraft Movie,” which grossed $41.3 million in its third weekend, to put its domestic total at nearly $345 million. Both “Sinners” and “A Minecraft Movie” are distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN. Shawn Robbins, director of movie analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory, told CNN that “Sinners” was boosted by the duo of Coogler and actor Michael B. Jordan, who have teamed up on four films, including Disney’s “Black Panther.” “That star power for ‘Sinners’ (and) really kind of a fresh, original take on the vampire movie (genre) … helped bring out moviegoers,” he said. “Sinners” has also been boosted by critics’ reviews, which can help a film’s long-term box-office success. It has a 98% rating on movie-ratings site Rotten Tomatoes and an 84 score — the seventh highest for a film in 2025 — on Metacritic. “This may be one of the best-reviewed No. 1 films ever, especially for the horror genre,” said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior analyst at Comscore. The success of “Sinners” is encouraging for the horror genre, which was most successful in 2017, when “It” and “Get Out” were released, according to Dergarabedian. Horror movies earned more than $1 billion at the box office in 2017, according to Comscore data. In 2024, the genre earned $948 million. “Horror movies can be very budget-friendly and have a very strong profitability factor, so that makes them particularly of interest to studios and filmmakers,” Dergarabedian told CNN. Universal Pictures is set to release two horror sequels this year, “M3GAN 2.0” and “Black Phone 2” in June and October, respectively. Meanwhile, the industry’s overall domestic earnings, which were down 13% at the opening of “A Minecraft Movie,” are now up 5.3% compared to 2024, according to Comscore. Box office analyst David A. Gross of FranchiseRe said “A Minecraft Movie” is trekking toward $1 billion at the worldwide box office. After its strong opening, the fantasy adventure comedy has gone viral for engaging audiences with its chicken jockey scene. “Audiences are totally engaged — this is mainstream action-adventure entertainment at its best,” Gross told CNN. Dergarabedian expects the overall box office to maintain this momentum as the first slate of summer movies debuts in May, followed by a strong Memorial Day weekend with Disney’s live-action “Lilo & Stitch” and Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning.”",,0.353469580411911
"One day in September, I stood in front of my open refrigerator, ravenous but unable to figure out what I should eat. I was worried that whatever I chose to eat would cause the new app on my phone to record a spike in my glucose levels that would count against the number I was allowed that day – and I was determined to conquer this algorithm. I’d just put on a continuous glucose monitor, a device that sticks to your arm and uses a tiny needle to provide near-real-time information about how much sugar is circulating in your blood – not because I have diabetes, the main use for what are called CGMs, but because these devices are starting to be marketed as wellness tools for everybody, and I wanted to see how they work. Apple? Too sugary. Granola bar? Hello, glucose spike. Cheese – that’s the ticket. A few days of wearing this monitor had taught me that cheese would not cause my glucose to go up. “Is this thing just inadvertently putting you on the keto diet?” my husband – who’d witnessed a few episodes of hanger while I was trying to figure out how to please my CGM – finally asked. Pretty much. Avoiding carbohydrates and prioritizing protein and fat, often together, didn’t lead to spikes in glucose that my CGM and app, Lingo from the health company Abbott, would count against me. But because I wasn’t aiming to switch to a very low-carb, ketogenic diet, I initially struggled to figure out what to eat; in the first week or so of wearing the CGM, my scale read my weight at 3 pounds lower than usual – a blip, I presume, because I was too nervous to eat normally. CGMs for people who don’t use insulin This is not, unsurprisingly, how experts say CGMs should be used, whether you have diabetes or not. Continuous glucose monitors have been revolutionary for people with type 1 diabetes, for whom glucose levels are life and death, providing information about how much insulin they need to inject to keep their blood sugar stable. The alternative is finger-stick testing, pricking fingertips to draw drops of blood to check glucose levels, often multiple times a day. “CGMs are life-changing for insulin-dependent diabetics,” said Laura Marston, an attorney and advocate for lower insulin prices who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a teenager. Before she got a CGM, she said, she’d go long periods without checking her glucose levels through finger-stick tests, instead adjusting her insulin doses based on how she was feeling, leading to hospitalizations with a dangerous condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Now, Marston said, she knows her glucose level every five minutes with a CGM, and her A1C, another measure of glucose in the blood, is steadily at a much better level – something she attributes both to the CGM and to focusing more on dealing with diabetes and having steadier health insurance. In that context, CGMs are medical devices, requiring prescriptions and – usually, but not always – receiving coverage through health insurance. CGMs can be covered for people with type 2 diabetes who use insulin, as well. But this year, Dexcom and Abbott, the two major makers of CGMs, introduced biosensors for people who don’t use insulin, available without a prescription and for about $89 a month out of pocket. Dexcom’s offering, called Stelo, was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration in March, based on data from a clinical study showing that the device performed similarly to other CGMs. In an FDA release, Dr. Jeff Shuren, then director of the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said that “CGMs can be a powerful tool to help monitor blood glucose” and that “giving more individuals valuable information about their health, regardless of their access to a doctor or health insurance, is an important step forward in advancing health equity for US patients.” Abbott’s Lingo was cleared in June and is targeted specifically for “consumers who want to better understand and improve their health and wellness,” the company said in a news release. The idea is that seeing near-instantaneous feedback to the glucose effects of food, exercise, sleep and stress might give people insights about unique ways their bodies react to different inputs and help them make changes to improve their health. Putting on the CGM I was excited to try it. Putting the device on was surprisingly painless, and an hour after the little disc was secured to my arm, I started seeing my glucose levels on the accompanying app on my phone. “117,” I messaged Dr. Jody Dushay, a physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who works with people with obesity and diabetes and who’d offered to review my CGM findings with me. The Lingo app told me that was within what it called a “typical healthy glucose range” of 70 to 140 milligrams per deciliter, noting that “occasionally, you may find yourself over 140 mg/dL or under 70 mg/dL, which is expected.” Dushay had warned me before I put on the CGM that blood sugar could range from the high 50s when fasting to the 150s after eating in a generally healthy young woman. She also emphasized that continuous glucose monitoring shouldn’t be used to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. Her caution about how I might react to seeing my data turned out to be warranted. In the first week I wore the monitor, I was glued to the app, watching my glucose rise shortly after eating. The app accumulates metrics that it calls Lingo Counts to try to help users make sense of the data, with a higher number associated with a bigger or longer elevation of glucose. Although the app gave me an initial target of 60 or under for my daily Lingo Count, I found myself trying to keep it as low as possible, a tendency reinforced by the app’s suggestions to do 20 squats after lunch to “find some balance” as my count was going up. I ended up keeping my count so low initially that the app reset my daily target to 22, which I exceeded frequently once some of my anxiety wore off. And although the finding that cheese didn’t lead to a glucose spike wasn’t a huge surprise, there were a few other readings that were interesting. A salad with chopped vegetables and quinoa that I thought was a healthy choice for a quick lunch registered one of my largest Lingo Counts of the week, probably because of the sugar in the peanut dressing. A glass of wine and a slice of pizza, on the other hand, didn’t cause a glucose surge – a happy revelation but not one that I can pretend will lead to better health. “Your values are all completely normal,” Dushay told me when I sent her screengrabs of my glucose levels. “What look like ‘spikes’ are perfectly fine excursions within the normal range.” But could those increases, even within a normal range, give me feedback on ways I could feel healthier? Stay full longer? Have more energy? Lower my risk of metabolic disease? Or would I learn only that, as Marston put it, my “pancreas functions as it should”? ‘A lot of strong opinions’ It depends on whom you ask; the scientific community appears to be divided on the value of continuous glucose monitoring for people who don’t have diabetes, a gulf that researchers say is exacerbated by a lack of data. There are “definitely a lot of strong opinions in the field,” said Dr. Nicole Spartano, an assistant professor at Boston University’s Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine who studies CGM use in non-diabetic people. Spartano said she conducted a study in which she surveyed clinicians who had expertise on CGMs and asked them to interpret about 20 reports on glucose levels in people without diabetes. “There’s no consensus about how they view the data,” she said. “Some people think high spikes are bad; some people think they’re meaningless in people without diabetes; some people think, ‘if it’s a prolonged period of a glucose excursion,’” over 180 or so, those people should be screened for diabetes; “other experts will see that and say that person is fine.” Dr. Robert Lustig, professor emeritus of pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of California San Francisco, who’s written several books warning against excess sugar and processed foods, is in the camp that says keeping glucose down is crucial. He argues that continuous glucose monitoring is useful for people without diabetes – if users get the right help interpreting their data. “Not everybody responds to the same foods as everyone else,” said Lustig, who’s an adviser to a company called Levels that offers continuous glucose monitoring along with an app. “The goal is to keep your glucose down, because when you keep your glucose down, you keep your insulin down, and when you keep your insulin down, then the insulin is not there to drive energy into fat, and it’s not there to cause cell growth, which is at the heart of chronic metabolic disease.” Lustig acknowledged that people using CGMs could experience the same anxiety I initially felt about the glucose data - but argued that anxiety could be lessened if users receive more help interpreting the information. And Dushay and Spartano emphasized that it would be particularly important for people who have a history of disordered eating or other food anxiety to talk with health-care providers before using a CGM. But for some, the devices provide surprising insights about how different people react to foods – like CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who’s worn a CGM along with his wife, Rebecca. Neither has diabetes, but they were curious about what they could learn to potentially improve their health. “When I eat blueberries, my glucose will not spike at all,” he said. “When she eats blueberries, her glucose will immediately spike.” With rice, he said, it’s the opposite: His glucose spikes, while Rebecca’s doesn’t. An Indian flatbread he’s been eating since he was a kid also caused a major increase. And sometimes, Gupta said, his glucose can go up to 180 milligrams per deciliter. With a history of diabetes in his family, which he’s discussed on his “Chasing Life” podcast, that’s enough to make him want to avoid those foods. My own experiment After four weeks of wearing a CGM – each biosensor device lasts two weeks – I decided to take a break and formulate a better plan before I applied my third and final monitor. I realized that the way I’d approached it the first time around was, as Dushay put it, “an artificial experiment”: I wasn’t using the CGM to get feedback about how I normally eat; I was eating abnormally in immediate response to the CGM. “Your first biosensor [should be] a look at what you’ve been doing over time, kind of what your body’s been experiencing, even though you didn’t have that peek behind the curtain,” said Pam Nisevich Bede, nutritionist for Abbott’s Lingo business. “And then you’re starting to experiment with a few different food choices, timing of meals, et cetera. And then with your next biosensor, you’re going to be fine-tuning those habits.” I decided not to look at my glucose levels for the first week of wearing the final monitor, recording my food by hand and entering it into the app at the end of each day. And in the second week, I’d try to make changes. I also repeated some meals to measure whether my glucose response was consistent, as a National Institutes of Health study found significant variability in CGM readings even in the same person to the same food, according to its author, Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. I’d just baked banana bread with my kids, so I repeated that for breakfast a few times that week and generated a fairly consistent increase in glucose, registering a 10 on my Lingo Count one day and an 11 another. On a third day, exercising afterwards blunted my Lingo Count by a few points. Even so, my glucose never exceeded about 136 milligrams per deciliter, even at its highest after banana bread. Swapping in Greek yogurt or chia pudding appeared to avoid accumulating Lingo Counts, although I’m not sure I needed a CGM to tell me those might be better choices than banana bread for breakfast. One thing the CGM did do was nudge me to avoid snacking mindlessly, which may be the kind of small behavioral modification that can make a difference. I didn’t want to have to track every bite of graham cracker I indulged in during my kids’ afternoon snack or to see the resulting increases in glucose on my app. “I think there’s a place for it in terms of behavioral management,” said Spartano, who’s leading research into whether CGMs can predict the development of diabetes as part of the Framingham Heart Study. “We’re just really early in this research space.” CNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.",,0.2046474814414978
"US President Donald Trump has boasted “jobs and factories will come roaring back” as he unleashed unprecedented tariffs around the world during his “Liberation Day” address. With his sweeping global tariffs now in effect, steep price hikes on products ranging from clothing to electronics could largely be borne by American consumers. Now, a prominent tech analyst has warned that the price of an Apple iPhone could soar to around $3,500 if they were made in the US. The president and his economic officials have promised that, as a result of the tariffs, numerous manufacturing jobs will eventually be “reshored” to US, employing millions of Americans. But Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the idea is a “fictional tale.” US-made iPhones could cost more than three times their current price of around $1,000, he added, because it would be necessary to replicate the highly complex production ecosystem that currently exists in Asia. “You build that (supply chain) in the US with a fab in West Virginia and New Jersey. They’ll be $3,500 iPhones,” he said, referring to fabrication plants, or high-tech manufacturing facilities where computer chips that power electronic devices are normally made. And even then, it would cost Apple about $30 billion and three years to move just 10% of their supply chain to the US to begin with, Ives told Burnett on Monday. CNN has reached out to Apple for comment. The making and assembly of smartphone parts shifted to Asia decades ago, as American companies largely focused on software development and product design, which generate much higher profit margins. That move has helped make Apple one of the world’s most valuable companies and cement itself as a dominant smartphone maker. Since Trump’s inauguration in late January, Apple’s shares have lost around 25% of their value due to concerns about the impact of tariffs on its sprawling supply chain, which is highly dependent on China and Taiwan. About 90% of iPhones are assembled in China. “That’s why I think you see what’s happened to the stock, because no company is more caught up in this tariff front and center in this category five storm than Cupertino and Apple,” he said. “It’s an economic Armageddon, but especially for the tech industry.” The chips that power iPhones are mainly manufactured in Taiwan, while its screen panels are supplied by South Korean companies. Some other components are made in China, and final assembly mostly takes place in the country. In February, Apple announced it would invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years as part of its effort expand production outside China and to avoid Trump’s tariffs on the country. Tech analysts agree that iPhone prices are likely to rise, even if supply chains stay where they are. Rosenblatt Securities, a New York-based investment bank, said iPhones could be 43% more expensive, should Apple pass on the entire cost of higher tariffs to consumers, according to a research note cited by Reuters. Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research, estimates that iPhone could cost about 30% more, but this could depend on where they are made. Apple has previously been seeking to diversify its production bases from China to India and Brazil and could look to shift production of key components to countries that face lower tariff barriers to keep the cost of its phones down. India faces 26% tariffs, whereas Brazil has been hit with 10%. Although Trump’s tariffs on Brazil are the lowest among key iPhone manufacturing centers, it probably doesn’t produce enough capacity to fill the gap left by China, Shah said.",,0.2751864492893219
"Microplastics are everywhere. They have been found on the peak of Mount Everest and in creatures inhabiting the deepest trenches of the sea. They’re in bottled water, human placentas and breast milk. These tiny plastic particles choke wildlife, disrupt ecosystems, and threaten human health – and they are notoriously difficult to remove. But scientists in China have come up with a possible solution: a biodegradable sponge made of squid bones and cotton. A research team from Wuhan University used chitin from squid bones and cellulose from cotton – two organic compounds known for eliminating pollution from wastewater – to create a biodegradable sponge. They then tested the sponge in four different water samples, taken from irrigation water, pond water, lake water and sea water, and found it removed up to 99.9% of microplastics, according to a study published last month in Science Advances. “The planet is under great threat from microplastics, and aquatic ecosystems are the first to suffer,” wrote the authors. “Even under a variety of policies, including plastic product reduction, waste management, and environmental recycling, microplastic pollution is irreversible and escalating.” The microplastics problem Microplastics are tiny shards of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters. They come from everything from tires, which are then broken down into smaller pieces, to microbeads, a plastic found in beauty products such as exfoliants. One study from 2020 estimated there are 14 million metric tons of microplastics sitting on the ocean floor. Scientists have called microplastics “one of this generation’s key environmental challenges” and the problem is an internationally recognized environmental issue. Plastic is a persistent pollution that hurts wildlife, the ocean itself and there’s growing concern about the potential health risks it poses to humans. The problem is only set to get worse with plastic production and pollution expected to increase in the coming years. Even if we embarked on an immediate and globally coordinated effort to reduce plastic consumption, an estimated 710 million metric tons of plastic would still pollute the environment by 2040, according to another study. That makes finding solutions to get rid of the plastics contaminating our oceans all the more urgent. The sponge created by the Wuhan researchers was able to absorb microplastics both by physically intercepting them and through electromagnetic attraction, the study said. Previously studied methods for absorbing plastics tend to be expensive and difficult to make, limiting their scalability. Last year, researchers in Qingdao, China developed a synthetic sponge made of starch and gelatin designed to remove microplastics from water, though its efficacy varied depending on water conditions.

      Microplastics are in many of your body’s organs and tissues. Why they’re so bad and what you can do to stay healthier The low cost and wide availability of both cotton and squid bones mean the sponge created in Wuhan “has great potential to be used in the extraction of microplastic from complex water bodies,” according to the study. Shima Ziajahromi, a lecturer at Australia’s Griffith University who studies microplastics, called the squid-cotton-sponge method “promising” and said it could be an effective way to “clean up the high risk and vulnerable aquatic ecosystem.” However, the study’s authors did not address whether the sponge can remove microplastics that sink to the sediment, which is the majority of microplastics in our waters, said Ziajahromi, who was not involved in the study. Another “critical issue” is the proper disposal of the sponges, Ziajahromi said. “Although the material is biodegradable, the microplastics it absorbs need to be disposed of properly,” she said. “Without careful management, this process risks transferring microplastics from one ecosystem to another.” Ultimately, Ziajahromi added, minimizing plastic pollution is in the first place should remain a “top priority.”",,0.18082398176193237
"The Parker Solar Probe zoomed by the sun on Tuesday during a record-breaking flyby, coming within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the solar surface during humanity’s closest approach to a star. The mission operations team, located at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, was able to confirm the success of the flyby Friday morning after receiving a signal from the spacecraft just before midnight on Thursday. The mission team knew it wouldn’t receive any communications from the spacecraft during its closest pass of the sun. Now, the team members will await more detailed data from Parker about the spacecraft’s status that’s expected to return to Earth on January 1. The uncrewed spacecraft flew at 430,000 miles per hour (692,000 kilometers per hour), which is fast enough to reach Tokyo from Washington, DC, in under a minute, according to NASA. The speedy flyby would make the probe the fastest human-made object in history, the agency shared December 16 during a NASA Science Live presentation on YouTube. The mission has been building up to this historic milestone since it launched on August 12, 2018 — an event attended by the probe’s namesake, Dr. Eugene Parker, an astrophysicist who pioneered the solar research field of heliophysics. Parker was the first living person to have a spacecraft named after him. The astrophysicist, whose research revolutionized humanity’s understanding of the sun and interplanetary space, died at age 94 in March 2022. But he was still able to witness how the spacecraft could help solve mysteries about the sun more than 65 years after the mission was originally envisioned. The probe became the first spacecraft to “touch the sun” by successfully flying through the sun’s corona, or upper atmosphere, to sample particles and our star’s magnetic fields in December 2021. Over the past six years of the spacecraft’s seven-year mission, the Parker Solar Probe has collected data to enlighten scientists about some of the sun’s greatest mysteries.Heliophysicists have long wondered how the solar wind, a constant stream of particles released by the sun, is generated as well as why the sun’s corona is so much hotter than its surface. Scientists also want to understand how coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere, are structured. When these ejections are aimed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of the planet’s magnetic field, that can affect satellites as well as power and communication infrastructure on Earth. Now, the time has come for Parker’s closest and final flybys, which could complete the answers to these enduring questions and uncover new mysteries by exploring uncharted solar territory. “Parker Solar Probe is changing the field of heliophysics,” said Helene Winters, Parker Solar Probe’s project manager from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, in a statement. “After years of braving the heat and dust of the inner solar system, taking blasts of solar energy and radiation that no spacecraft has ever seen, Parker Solar Probe continues to thrive.” Parker’s flyby at around 6:53 a.m. ET on Christmas Eve was planned as the first of the spacecraft’s final three closest approaches, with the other two expected to occur on March 22 and June 19. The spacecraft came so close to our star that if the distance between Earth and the sun were the length of an American football field, the spacecraft would be about 4 yards from the end zone, according to NASA. At this proximity, the probe would be able to fly through plumes of plasma as well as within a solar eruption if one releases from the sun. The spacecraft was built to withstand the extremes of the sun and has flown through coronal mass ejections in the past with no impact to the vehicle, said Parker Solar Probe project scientist Nour Rawafi. The spacecraft is equipped with a carbon foam shield that is 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) thick and 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide. On Earth before launch, the shield was tested and able to withstand temperatures near 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (nearly 1,400 degrees Celsius). On Christmas Eve, the shield likely faced temperatures up to 1,800 F (980 degrees C), which the telemetry data expected in January will confirm. Meanwhile, the spacecraft’s interior is at a comfortable room temperature so the electronics systems and science instruments can operate as expected. A unique cooling system designed by the Applied Physics Laboratory pumps water through the craft’s solar arrays to keep them at a steady temperature of 320 F (160 C), even during close approaches to the sun. The spacecraft carried out its flyby autonomously because mission control was out of contact with the probe due to its proximity to the sun. The immense set of data and images gathered during the flyby won’t become available to mission control until Parker has moved away from the sun in its orbit, which will occur about three weeks later in mid-January, Rawafi said. Just over a year after the Parker Solar Probe first launched, the sun entered a new solar cycle. Now, the sun is experiencing solar maximum, meaning that the mission has had a chance to witness most of a solar cycle and the transitions between its highs and lows, said Dr. C. Alex Young, associate director for science in the Heliophysics Science Division at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Scientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced in October that the sun has reached solar maximum, or the peak of activity within its 11-year cycle. At the peak of the solar cycle, the sun’s magnetic poles flip, causing the sun to transition from calm to active. Experts track increasing solar activity by counting how many sunspots appear on the sun’s surface. And the sun is expected to remain active for the next year or so. The sun’s increasing activity became obvious this year during two major displays of auroras on Earth in May and October, when coronal mass ejections released by the sun were directed at our planet. The solar storms are also responsible for generating auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. “Both of those storms caused auroras to be visible down to the very bottom of the United States,” Young said. “But the May storm was an especially strong storm. In fact, we think it could be a 100- to possibly 500-year event, and that caused auroras very close to the equator, which is extremely unheard of. It was a worldwide event that millions and, hopefully billions, of people, were able to see, and it may not happen again.” The data gathered by Parker Solar Probe could enable scientists to better understand solar storms and even how to predict them, Young said. “The sun is the only star that we can see in detail, but we can actually go to and measure it directly,” Young said. “It’s a laboratory in our solar system that allows us to learn about all the other stars in the universe and how all those stars interact with the billions and billions of other planets that may or may not be like our own planets in our solar system.” With that in mind, Rawafi said he hopes that the sun puts on a spectacular show during the probe’s close approaches, enabling scientists to gain insights into the sun’s activity. “Sun, please do your best,” Rawafi said. “Give us the strongest event you can do, and the Parker Solar Probe can deal with it.”",,0.2836645841598511
"Less than a few hours after Snapchat rolled out its My AI chatbot to all users last week, Lyndsi Lee, a mother from East Prairie, Missouri, told her 13-year-old daughter to stay away from the feature. “It’s a temporary solution until I know more about it and can set some healthy boundaries and guidelines,” said Lee, who works at a software company. She worries about how My AI presents itself to young users like her daughter on Snapchat. The feature is powered by the viral AI chatbot tool ChatGPT – and like ChatGPT, it can offer recommendations, answer questions and converse with users. But Snapchat’s version has some key differences: Users can customize the chatbot’s name, design a custom Bitmoji avatar for it, and bring it into conversations with friends. The net effect is that conversing with Snapchat’s chatbot may feel less transactional than visiting ChatGPT’s website. It also may be less clear you’re talking to a computer. “I don’t think I’m prepared to know how to teach my kid how to emotionally separate humans and machines when they essentially look the same from her point of view,” Lee said. “I just think there is a really clear line [Snapchat] is crossing.” The new tool is facing backlash not only from parents but also from some Snapchat users who are bombarding the app with bad reviews in the app store and criticisms on social media over privacy concerns, “creepy” exchanges and an inability to remove the feature from their chat feed unless they pay for a premium subscription. While some may find value in the tool, the mixed reactions hint at the risks companies face in rolling out new generative AI technology to their products, and particularly in products like Snapchat, whose users skew younger. Snapchat was an early launch partner when OpenAI opened up access to ChatGPT to third-party businesses, with many more expected to follow. Almost overnight, Snapchat has forced some families and lawmakers to reckon with questions that may have seemed theoretical only months ago. In a letter to the CEOs of Snap and other tech companies last month, weeks after My AI was released to Snap’s subscription customers, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet raised concerns about the interactions the chatbot was having with younger users. In particular, he cited reports that it can provide kids with suggestions for how to lie to their parents. “These examples would be disturbing for any social media platform, but they are especially troubling for Snapchat, which almost 60 percent of American teenagers use,” Bennet wrote. “Although Snap concedes My AI is ‘experimental,’ it has nevertheless rushed to enroll American kids and adolescents in its social experiment.” In a blog post last week, the company said: “My AI is far from perfect but we’ve made a lot of progress.” User backlash In the days since its formal launch, Snapchat users have been vocal about their concerns. One user called his interaction “terrifying” after he said it lied about not knowing where the user was located. After the user lightened the conversation, he said the chatbot accurately revealed he lived in Colorado. In another TikTok video with more than 1.5 million views, a user named Ariel recorded a song with an intro, chorus and piano chords written by My AI about what it’s like to be a chatbot. When she sent the recorded song back, she said the chatbot denied its involvement with the reply: “I’m sorry, but as an AI language model, I don’t write songs.” Ariel called the exchange “creepy.” Other users shared concerns about how the tool understands, interacts with and collects information from photos. “I snapped a picture … and it said ‘nice shoes’ and asked who the people [were] in the photo,” a Snapchat user wrote on Facebook. Snapchat told CNN it continues to improve My AI based on community feedback and is working to establish more guardrails to keep its users safe. The company also said that similar to its other tools, users don’t have to interact with My AI if they don’t want to. It’s not possible to remove My AI from chat feeds, however, unless a user subscribes to its monthly premium service, Snapchat+. Some teens say they have opted to pay the $3.99 Snapchat+ fee to turn off the tool before promptly canceling the service. But not all users dislike the feature. One user wrote on Facebook that she’s been asking My AI for homework help. “It gets all of the questions right.” Another noted she’s leaned on it for comfort and advice. “I love my little pocket, bestie!” she wrote. “You can change the Bitmoji [avatar] for it and surprisingly it offers really great advice to some real life situations. … I love the support it gives.” An early reckoning over how teens use chatbots ChatGPT, which is trained on vast troves of data online, has previously come under fire for spreading inaccurate information, responding to users in ways they might find inappropriate and enabling students to cheat. But Snapchat’s integration of the tool risks heightening some of these issues, and adding new ones. Alexandra Hamlet, a clinical psychologist in New York City, said the parents of some of her patients have expressed concern about how their teenager could interact with Snapchat’s tool. There’s also concern around chatbots giving advice and about mental health because AI tools can reinforce someone’s confirmation bias, making it easier for users to seek out interactions that confirm their unhelpful beliefs. “If a teen is in a negative mood and does not have the awareness desire to feel better, they may seek out a conversation with a chatbot that they know will make them feel worse,” she said. “Over time, having interactions like these can erode a teens’ sense of worth, despite their knowing that they are really talking to a bot. In an emotional state of mind, it becomes less possible for an individual to consider this type of logic.” For now, the onus is on parents to start meaningful conversations with their teens about best practices for communicating with AI, especially as the tools start to show up in more popular apps and services. Sinead Bovell, the founder of WAYE, a startup that helps prepare youth for future with advanced technologies, said parents need to make it very clear “chatbots are not your friend.” “They’re also not your therapists or a trusted adviser, and anyone interacting with them needs to be very cautious, especially teenagers who may be more susceptible to believing what they say,” she said. “Parents should be talking to their kids now about how they shouldn’t share anything personal with a chatbot that they would a friend – even though from a user design perspective, the chatbot exists in the same corner of Snapchat.” She added that federal regulation that would require companies to abide by specific protocols is also needed to keep up the rapid pace of AI advancement.",,0.22082050144672394
"OpenAI countersued Elon Musk Wednesday, citing a pattern of harassment by Musk and asking a federal judge to stop him from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI, in a court case over the future structure of the firm that helped launch the AI revolution. Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Recently Musk, who went on to create his own AI firm, xAI, in 2023, has tried to prevent the ChatGPT maker from transitioning to a for-profit model, culminating in the current court case. In order for OpenAI to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round, the company must complete its transition by the end of the year. Related video
      Bernie Sanders’ warning to Americans about Musk, AI and jobs “Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,” the company wrote in a filing in Musk’s existing lawsuit against OpenAI in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. OpenAI asked the judge to stop Musk from any further attacks, as well as that Musk be “held responsible for the damage he has already caused.” The two parties are set to begin a jury trial in spring next year. In response, Musk’s legal team referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid earlier this year from a Musk-led consortium, which OpenAI rejected. “Had OpenAI’s board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do, they would have seen how serious it was. It’s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI’s assets allegedly ‘interferes’ with their business plans,” Musk’s lawyer Marc Toberoff said in a statement provided to Reuters. In a post on X, the social media platform that Musk owns, OpenAI said: “Elon’s nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit.” Musk’s xAI last month acquired X in a deal that values the social media company at $33 billion and allows the value of his artificial intelligence firm to be shared with co-investors in X. Last year, Musk, who is also the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla, sued OpenAI and Altman, accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission – to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit. Musk did not respond to a request for comment on the OpenAI filing. OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations, while Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor. At stake in the lawsuit is the ChatGPT maker’s transition to a for-profit model, which the start-up says is crucial to raising more capital and competing well in the expensive AI race.",,0.2560834586620331
"Silicon Valley leaders donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign or inaugural fund. They visited him at Mar-a-Lago and sat front-and-center as he was sworn into office. But in the first three months of his presidency, their wallets have taken a hit from his policies. The companies founded or run by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have cumulatively lost nearly $1.8 trillion in value since the start of this year, even after markets rebounded Wednesday in response to Trump’s pause on many planned tariffs. As a result, the personal wealth of those leaders has shrunk, too. Tech’s top brass almost certainly hoped to gain some business benefits by hitching their wagons to Trump’s — such as fewer regulations or reduced antitrust pressure. And Trump has been eager to expand the tech industry’s US footprint and cement America as a leader in artificial intelligence. But the losses across Big Tech indicate that Silicon Valley will also face a slew of new challenges in the wake of uncertainty around Trump’s tariff plans, which heavily target supply chains in Asia where tech companies source components and assemble products. Despite Trump’s pause on “reciprocal” tariffs that had been set to apply to many US trading partners, tariffs on China will increase to 125% from 104%. And while tariffs pose a direct challenge to tech giants, their economic ripple effects could also have negative implications if consumers and advertisers tighten their purse strings. Analysts had warned that long-term reciprocal tariffs, and the resulting economic uncertainty, could shrink tech earnings by as much as 25%, according to a Sunday report from UBS. That would mark a big shift from the relatively steady profit and share price gains that Big Tech has enjoyed in recent years thanks to AI. On Monday, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives  described Trump’s tariff policy as an “Armageddon” for the tech sector, adding that it “makes the tech investing landscape the most difficult I have seen in 25 years covering tech stocks.” Meta, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and a representative for Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment. Musk has experienced the most dramatic losses. Despite donating at least $290 million to support Trump’s reelection and his involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency, the world’s richest man’s net worth has plunged $143 billion since the start of 2025, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index data from April 8. That’s due largely to the sharp decline in Tesla shares, weighed down by Musk’s controversial work in the government, increasing competition and now, the threat of tariffs. Tesla shares fell 28% and its market capitalization dropped $376.6 billion since the start of this year, as of market close on April 9, having largely erased its post-election gains. Musk has said tariffs could have a “significant” impact on Tesla. While Musk may be in the spotlight due to his proximity to Trump, he’s not the only prominent tech figure to experience recent losses. (The most recent net worth data available on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index is from April 8; the scale of their losses may be smaller after the market’s rebound Wednesday.) Meta was one of the first big companies to pledge a $1 million donation to Trump’s inaugural fund, and Zuckerberg has met with Trump repeatedly, both before and after he took office, to discuss policy priorities. Zuckerberg also made several Trump-friendly changes to his business, including elevating a prominent Republican to the company’s top policy job, cutting professional fact-checkers and adding Trump ally and UFC boss Dana White to Meta’s board of directors. Zuckerberg’s net worth has fallen by $26.5 billion since the start of 2025. Meta’s share price has declined nearly 2.25% year-to-date, dragging down the company’s valuation by $35.8 billion. Bezos was quick to congratulate Trump on his election win in November, calling it an “extraordinary political comeback,” and Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. Bezos was also behind The Washington Post’s controversial decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. Bezos’ net worth has declined by $47.2 billion since the start of this year, according to Bloomberg. Amazon’s shares are down 13% year-to-date, bringing the company’s total valuation down by $316.8 billion since the start of this year. Google donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund and streamed the event live on YouTube. And Pichai joined the parade of CEOs who visited Mar-a-Lago in the weeks following the election. But Google’s stock has now fallen 16.2%, and its valuation is down $386.7 billion since the start of this year. Apple’s Cook also personally donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, Axios reported in January, after meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the election to discuss tariffs and European tech regulations. Apple also handed Trump a political win earlier this year when it announced a $500 billion investment in US facilities over the next four years. Although some of those plans were likely in place before Trump took office, the president claimed credit for the move, saying it showed “faith in what we are doing.” But Apple, which produces many of its gadgets in foreign markets such as China, Vietnam and India, is expected to take an especially big hit from Trump’s tariffs. Its stock is down 18.5% from the start of this year, and $684 billion has been shaved off its market value. During Trump’s first term, many big tech companies lobbied for exemptions from Trump’s tariffs. This time, however, the situation is much less certain, a point that analysts at Moody’s Ratings made in a recent research note. “While it is difficult to estimate the effects,” the analysts wrote, “we believe no technology subsector will go unharmed.”",,0.2791256308555603
"If paying $1,000 for a new iPhone already sounded expensive, consumers should brace for even greater sticker shock later this year. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign goods – specifically those sourced from China – are expected to heighten the prices of everyday tech products, from iPhones to laptops, cars and even smaller gadgets like headphones and computer mice. And iPhone prices could rise substantially and soon – possibly in a matter of weeks or months, according to analysts who spoke with CNN. Like many tech companies, Apple’s supply chain is largely based in China, which now faces a tariff of at least 145%, the White House clarified Thursday, meaning products and materials from the country are bound to get more expensive. In yet another escalation in the ongoing trade war with Beijing, Trump announced on Wednesday a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs on every country except China. Related article
      iPhone could triple in price to $3,500 if they’re made in the US In the near term, Apple and its many partners will have to carefully manage the iPhone inventory currently stored in the US. But if the Trump administration’s tariffs stick, Apple might have to make long-term adjustments to the way it sources, builds and potentially even releases new products. Apple received an exemption from tariffs on certain products during Trump’s previous administration, but there hasn’t been any indication of whether it will be granted similar immunity this time. “I think (Apple) will have to go through a period of pain,” said Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys that covers the smartphone industry. “And that will mean… price rises.” Apple declined to comment. How iPhone prices may change in the US With 90% of Apple’s iPhone production and assembly based in China, according to Wedbush Securities’ estimates, iPhone prices are likely to rise if Trump’s tariffs remain in place. When and by how much are still up in the air. The timing largely depends on Apple’s US iPhone inventory, which hinges on consumers demand ahead of anticipated tariff price hikes. While Apple isn’t expected to release its next new iPhone until September, it’s possible prices could rise sooner if Apple runs through its current stock in the US. “The reality is, the price… increases that we’re going to see will hit all phones from Apple, as well as others, when inventory runs out,” said Ryan Reith, group vice president for the International Data Corporation’s (IDC) Worldwide Device Tracker. Reith estimates that Apple has about three weeks of inventory in the US that it can “maximize,” while Canalys believes there is likely enough iPhone inventory for the next two to three months. Counterpoint Research, another firm that monitors global smartphone shipments, estimates Apple likely has 4.5 to six weeks of inventory in the US, although February data indicates “a spike to well above those levels,” Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst for Counterpoint, said via email. Although it’s too soon to tell exactly how the news of Trump’s tariffs is impacting US smartphone shipments, Leathem said Canalys has seen “some of the largest numbers of shipments of devices into the market” in recent weeks. Pricing, however, will depend on whether Apple and its partners decide to absorb some of the additional cost. Analysts at UBS estimate that the base model of a $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max assembled in mainland China could increase by $800, or 67%, while an iPhone 16 Pro assembled in India could see just a $45 increase. Those estimates factor in Trump’s newly announced 125% tariff on Chinese imports and 90-day pause on all other “reciprocal” tariffs. Before Wednesday’s news, the firm had put those price increases at $675 and $120, respectively. Wireless carriers could also offer discounts on previous generation phones to push customers towards older devices that are already in low inventory, says Reith. Service providers also typically offer monthly installment payment plans for new phones, which could help relieve some of the cost passed down to consumers. Data from analytics firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners indicates that 55% of phone buyers in the US – including those who purchase flip phones and basic mobile phones – purchase their device through installment plans like these. How Apple could deal with tariffs in the long term Trump believes iPhone production could move to the US, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday. But the possibility of that seems unlikely. Over the past several years, Apple has shifted parts of its supply chain to India and Vietnam to reduce reliance on China. Apple has reportedly been sourcing more of its US-bound iPhones from India instead of China in recent days, according to reports from The Financial Times and The Times of India. Even if it shifted production to the US, Apple would likely still source many of its components from Asian countries, as Bank of America analysts wrote in a research note on April 3. “Everything that’s inside, that still really comes through China,” said Reith. “And that’s not going to change anytime soon.” Building an iPhone in the US would also be more expensive, partially because of higher labor costs, said Willy Shih, a professor of management practice in business administration at Harvard Business School. Bank of America’s research said it would cost roughly 20% more to make an iPhone in the US, while Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said a US-made iPhone could be as pricey as $3,500. Apple announced in February that it plans to invest $500 billion in expanding its US footprint. But iPhone factories aren’t part of that commitment; it instead includes new server production facilities to power its Apple Intelligence software features and a Detroit academy to train small businesses on manufacturing techniques, among other plans. And building new facilities could take years, whereas it’s unclear how long Trump’s tariffs will remain in place. But a bigger problem than simply building a new factory may be finding Americans who would want to work in it. “I think they would be hard-pressed to get the scale of labor,” said Shih. “They’d be hard-pressed to find people who are willing to do that type of job.” Then there’s the question of whether Apple could make broader changes to its product launch schedule if the US – part of the company’s largest market – becomes increasingly challenging because of tariffs. Doing so could be a potential strategy to mitigate the tariffs’ impact, along with supply chain changes and price increases, Bank of America noted in its April 3 report. Apple hasn’t mentioned any changes to its product lineup or strategy in response to the tariffs. But Reith said he could see the company adjusting its product launch schedule temporarily, then shifting back to a more regular product launch cycle if tariffs persist – although this is his opinion, and he hasn’t heard of any plans to do so. In the early days of the pandemic in 2020, for example, Apple announced its new iPhones in October instead of September. “Everything is on the table,” Reith said.

"Electronics imported to the United States will be exempt from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, according to a US Customs and Border Protection notice posted late Friday. Smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are among the exempted products. The exemption applies to products entering the United States or removed from warehouses as early as April 5, according to the notice. The exemption, which comes after the Trump administration on Wednesday imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145% on Chinese goods imported to the United States, does not include the 20% tariff on Chinese goods for the country’s role in the fentanyl trade. The tariff exemption would have a major impact on tech giants like Apple, which make iPhones and other products in China. Roughly 90% of Apple’s iPhone production and assembly is based in China, according to Wedbush Securities’ estimates. Analysts at Wedbush Securities on Saturday called the tariff exclusion, “the best news possible for tech investors.” “Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday,” Wedbush said in a statement. “A big step forward for US tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend…now onto the next step in negotiations on the broader China tariff war which will take a number of months at least.” Nvidia and Microsoft declined to comment to CNN. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Counterpoint Research, a firm that monitors global smartphone shipments, estimated Apple has up to six weeks of inventory in the United States. Once that supply runs out, prices would have been expected to go up. The White House said on Saturday that Trump will continue to urge tech companies to move production to the United States. “President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops. That’s why the President has secured trillions of dollars in U.S. investments from the largest tech companies in the world, including Apple, (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), and Nvidia. At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Trump had told reporters Friday on Air Force One that there could be possible exclusions to his sweeping tariffs. “There could be a couple of exceptions for obvious reasons, but I would say 10% is a floor,” Trump said. Economists have warned the cost of tariffs may ultimately be passed on to the consumer. That fear has sent many Americans rushing to buy big-ticket items, such as cars and electronics, as consumer sentiment has dropped to record lows. Nintendo said on April 4 that it would postpone the US preorder date of its Switch 2 gaming console to “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Initially priced at $450, the Switch 2 could instead cost around $600 as a result of tariffs, according to experts. The Trump administration says these tariffs would bring more manufacturing jobs to the United States and reverse a decades-long decline. But some products can’t be easily made or found in the United States, thus increasing the costs to produce them in American factories. Semiconductors and microchips are among the products heavily outsourced to factories in Asia due to lower costs. Those electronic parts are now exempt, according to the Friday notice. That could help Asian chipmakers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), South Korea’s Samsung and SK Hynix. “The president has stated that autos, steel, pharmaceuticals, chips and other specific materials will be included in specific tariffs to ensure tariffs are applied fairly and effectively,” a White House official said. The official said Trump would soon order a study on the national security effects on semiconductor imports — known as a Section 232 study. At a Republican National Congressional Committee event on Tuesday, Trump criticized the Biden administration’s decision to award a $6.6 billion grant to TSMC for semiconductor production in Phoenix as part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. Trump said he gave TSMC no money and told the company “if you don’t build your plant here, you’re going to pay a big tax — 25, maybe 50, maybe 75, maybe 100%.” CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Lisa Eadicicco contributed to this report.

"“Need an Uber Eats account in Jacksonville, FL ASAP.” “I have one.” “Looking for an Uber eats account to rent in Virginia.” “Available.” Those exchanges were found on a public Facebook group with more than 22,000 members called “UBER ACCOUNT FOR RENT WORLDWIDE.” It’s just one of 80 Facebook groups where users regularly discuss buying, selling and renting driver accounts for Uber, DoorDash and UK-based Deliveroo that were identified in a new report from the non-profit tech watchdog Tech Transparency Project, which CNN received exclusively ahead of its Monday release. These Facebook “black market groups” could let people bypass those platforms’ background checks and driver’s license requirements to fraudulently pose as a credentialed driver or delivery worker, researchers wrote in the report. And that could create risks for users who rely on safety assurances from apps such as Uber and DoorDash to ride in strangers’ cars or order deliveries to their homes. “It’s incredibly concerning because part of the reason Uber has been such an attractive tool for women, in particular, is because there’s some sort of semblance of safety when there’s tracking of who this person is … if something were to happen,” said Tech Transparency Project Director Katie Paul. “If that’s not the case, then what’s the point of using this platform?” A Meta spokesperson said the company would review the report and remove any content that violated its rules. Five Facebook groups were removed after CNN flagged them to Meta — including “UBER ACCOUNT FOR RENT WORLDWIDE” — for violating the company’s “Fraud, Scams and Deceptive Practices” policy. DoorDash spokesperson Julian Crowley said in a statement that the company is “hitting account fraudsters hard, from aggressively enforcing our rules to rolling out even more safeguards to shut down unauthorized access.” “Our tough approach is delivering clear results: we’re deactivating more fraudulent accounts, conducting more real-time identity checks, and preventing more offenders from returning,” Crowley said. An Uber spokesperson said “protecting the integrity of our platform is a top priority. Account sharing is never allowed, and we have robust safeguards in place from account creation to trip completion designed to help verify that the person using an account is the rightful owner.” “When we determine that an account holder is engaging in account sharing, or other forms of fraud, we ban their account from the platform,” the Uber spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company works with law enforcement when it identifies fraudulent behavior. A Deliveroo spokesperson said that “buying or selling access to a rider account is against our terms of service, and we will offboard any account found to be partaking in this behaviour,” adding that the company conducts daily identity verification checks, among other safety measures. “We take our responsibilities extremely seriously and will continue to strengthen our controls to prevent misuse of our platform.” An existing safety concern The issue isn’t entirely new. In 2019, London’s transportation regulator attempted to temporarily bar Uber from operating in the city over safety concerns, including that unauthorized drivers had been able to access the app and pick up riders using authorized drivers’ accounts. Uber at the time called the move “extraordinary and wrong” and said it didn’t reflect safety updates the platform had made. Last year, Wired profiled a woman who made thousands of dollars fraudulently renting out Uber and DoorDash accounts before being arrested after Uber tipped off the FBI. Heather Childs, then Uber’s trust and safety chief, told Wired the company was “committed to constantly improving our detection capabilities to protect against fraudsters’ ever-evolving schemes.” A DoorDash spokesperson said the company had made “huge strides on tackling fraud.” Related article
      Uber can continue operating in London In February, police in Wilbraham, Massachusetts arrested a man accused of raping a woman after making an Uber Eats delivery to her home. The alleged victim told police that the app had indicated a woman would be delivering her order, but the man showed up instead, according to a report from the Boston Globe. Uber at the time called the incident “horrifying” and said it banned the driver account. Lawyers for the accused man said he denied the allegations, the Globe reported. To sign up to drive or deliver on Uber, DoorDash and Deliveroo, workers must have a valid ID or driver’s license and insurance and undergo a background check. Both Uber and DoorDash prohibit sharing driver accounts. Deliveroo allows workers to appoint “substitutes” to deliver orders for them, but they must also go through an identity check process, and the app bans buying or renting access to accounts. Still, the Tech Transparency Project report suggests that more must be done to prevent unauthorized drivers from delivering orders or shuttling riders. The group is also urging Facebook-parent Meta to more aggressively enforce its rules against fraud and deceptive practices by cracking down on these black-market groups. TTP has previously reported on Facebook groups that enabled unauthorized buying and selling of business manager accounts to run ad campaigns on the site, raising scam and election interference concerns. Meta said it removed those groups when flagged. Meta needs “more reliance on human moderators,” in addition to its automated tools, TTP’s Paul said. “Unfortunately, we have a single researcher looking at this who is able to find this problem very easily, and the platform’s failure to invest in human expertise is a major problem.” ‘Uber Delivery Drivers Account for Rent’ For the report, Tech Transparency Project said researchers created a new Facebook account and began typing “uber account” into the platform’s search bar. Before the words had been fully typed in, Facebook auto-populated “uber account for rent” as the first suggested search term. That led researchers to dozens of Facebook groups where users sought or offered up active Uber, DoorDash or Deliveroo accounts. Users often posted publicly in the groups to advertise or ask for an account. Once they received a response, the requesters often suggested moving the conversation out of public view to direct messages, the report states. As of the report’s publication, at least 73 of the original 80 Facebook groups that researchers identified were still active, according to Tech Transparency Project. “TTP did not interact with any of the users posting offers for driver accounts and was not able to examine the names, profile photos, or other details of the accounts for sale or rent,” the report states. “But clearly, they are meant to give people the ability to drive for these services under a false identity.” CNN was able to recreate many of the researchers’ findings. After one CNN reporter typed “uber ac” into Facebook’s search bar, the platform automatically suggested “uber accounts for rent” as the first search term. Searches for “doordash acc” and “deliveroo acc” returned similar results. Related article
      Meta is getting rid of fact checkers. Zuckerberg acknowledged more harmful content will appear on the platforms now Public and private buying and selling groups, some with tens of thousands of members, are easy to find on Facebook, CNN’s review showed. A Google search for “uber account for rent” surfaces the “UBER ACCOUNT FOR RENT WORLDWIDE” Facebook group as the second result. Google searches for “doordash account for rent” and “deliveroo account for rent” also return similar Facebook groups among the results. While some posts in these groups appear to be spam or scams, others are seemingly genuine offers. A January post from one group called “Uber Delivery Drivers Account for Rent,” which was created in 2024 and boasts more than 2,000 members, offered an Uber Eats driver account “on rent,” according to the report. When a commenter inquired about the cost, the original poster responded, listing the price as $65. A CNN review of the same group showed that another user posted the following in April: “Hi, I’m interested in renting a delivery account long-term (London). I kindly ask for and offer seriousness!” Another user responded saying, “Inbox me.” The groups pose a challenge for delivery and rideshare platforms, which have attempted to crack down on account sharing or selling. In December, DoorDash said it would more frequently re-verify Dashers’ identities with regular, real-time selfie requirements. Each week, the platform requires more than 150,000 Dashers to go through identity verifications, and 15,000 prospective Dashers are prevented from accessing the platform because they failed to meet its criteria. The company also says monthly deactivations of inauthentic accounts doubled from the prior year. “While many of these (Facebook) ‘ads’ are scams for accounts that don’t actually exist, we take all fraud seriously. Our teams actively monitor for suspicious activity — including ads for fraudulent accounts — and take action,” DoorDash’s Crowley said. “We’ve reached out to Meta to collaborate in dismantling these groups and stand ready to work with enforcement to hold fraudsters accountable.” In January, Uber published a blog post outlining its efforts to verify drivers’ identities, including similar live selfie identity checks, consumer reporting tools and automated fraud monitoring software to identify risks such as multiple devices being registered to one account. And earlier this year, Deliveroo told UK lawmakers that it had removed 105 delivery workers from the platform since April 2024 because substitute users of the accounts had provided “invalid right to work documents.” Tech Transparency Project raised concerns that a recent pullback by Meta on some automatic rules enforcement could make the black markets problem worse. Meta said in January it would update its automated moderation systems to focus only on high-severity rules violations, such as child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams and that other concerns would have to be reported by users before the company evaluates them. (A Meta spokesperson said this area of enforcement would not be affected by its January policy changes.) Facebook groups where users can access unauthorized rideshare or delivery driver accounts “creates obvious safety risks for Americans and others around the world who use these services,” the report states. “Until Meta cleans up this problem, it will continue to facilitate fraudulent activity that shadows the entire rideshare industry.”",,0.1682046502828598
"CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Meta’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp on the stand this week during the start of trial over the blockbuster antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission. But, it turns out, Zuckerberg predicted that he might find himself in this position years ago – and even proposed the idea of spinning off Instagram himself. That was one of several takeaways from more than 10 hours of testimony from Meta’s CEO, during which he pushed back on the FTC’s claims that the company has built an illegal “social network monopoly” by acquiring would-be rivals. The testimony painted a picture of how Zuckerberg views the competition and the company’s struggles to keep up with a rapidly evolving social media landscape that it argues has pushed users toward rivals like TikTok and YouTube. There’s a lot at stake for Meta, as it could be forced to offload Instagram and WhatsApp if it loses. Here are the biggest takeaways from Zuckerberg, who took the stand just before former Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg testified on Wednesday. Zuckerberg considered breaking off Instagram In 2018, Zuckerberg raised concerns to other executives that “as calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,” according to an email produced in court. In light of that, Zuckerberg suggested spinning off Instagram because the company’s “family of apps” structure could hurt Facebook. He added: “most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up.” Of course, Meta didn’t end up spinning Instagram or WhatsApp off, and it’s now in court fighting the FTC to avoid having to do just that. Zuckerberg worried about competition from Instagram and WhatsApp Zuckerberg was indeed concerned that WhatsApp and Instagram could threaten Facebook’s dominance prior to buying the platforms, documents presented during FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson’s questioning suggested. In 2011, Zuckerberg appeared to realize that Facebook’s now-defunct Facebook Camera service was falling behind Instagram in functionality and popularity. “In the time it has taken us to get our act together on this, Instagram has become a large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos, which will increasingly be the future of photos,” Zuckerberg wrote in an email at the time. Facebook ended up acquiring Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012. In a 2012 email to then-COO Sandberg, Zuckerberg said then-Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer’s teams “are executing well technically but their results this year are only okay so far.” “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion,” he wrote in the email. “That’s not exactly killing it.” Then in 2013, Zuckerberg told then-growth head Javier Olivan he worried that WhatsApp would develop features similar to Facebook and Instagram and could “start winning in the US and other markets.” Olivan responded at the time he had been having “sleepless nights” worried that WhatsApp was “the real deal.” Facebook had also been concerned around that time that Google could acquire WhatsApp before it did. But Zuckerberg said in court Wednesday, during cross examination by Meta’s lawyer, that he thought it was “extremely unlikely” that WhatsApp would build competitive features after his first meeting with the platform’s co-founder Jan Koum. Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. Zuckerberg also claimed that Meta made both platforms better for users by acquiring them. People aren’t adding many new friends on Facebook these days Zuckerberg originally built Facebook to connect and share content with friends and family. That’s the market that the FTC claims Meta now dominates. But Zuckerberg said that kind of use of his product has been declining. The FTC’s lawyer on Tuesday asked Zuckerberg about an internal document from 2022 that indicated “friending and friend sharing are losing steam.” “The amount that people are sharing with friends on Facebook, especially, has been declining,” Zuckerberg said. “Even the amount of new friends that people add … I think has been declining. But I don’t know the exact numbers.” But the future isn’t necessarily the content creator-filled feeds that have become the norm on Meta’s products. Instead, Zuckerberg said, messaging between individuals or friend groups is becoming more popular than sharing content on more public social media feeds. “Messaging has been growing dramatically, and sharing with friends in feeds has been declining,” he said Tuesday. Zuckerberg sees YouTube as a big rival It’s not just TikTok and Snapchat; Google’s YouTube platform is also a major rival to Facebook, the Meta CEO said on the stand this week. YouTube has indeed been capturing the attention of younger audiences; Pew Research found that nine in 10 US teens use YouTube, while Facebook usage has “steeply declined” over the past decade among that age group. Zuckerberg attributed this in part to a rise in “richer forms of media,” like video, as mobile networks have grown more capable in the last 10 years. “YouTube is the most competitive for creators,” he said Wednesday, referring to online personalities that garner huge followings through posting videos on platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. “My understanding … is that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined, certainly more than either one independently,” he said. Still, Meta holds a firm grip on the social media market, especially in the US, according to Pew Research, where it operates a quarter of the most widely-used social media platforms.",,0.23018161952495575
"Tens of thousands of people likely got a break from their afternoon meetings on Wednesday when Zoom outages prevented users from joining meetings and accessing the website. Disruptions peaked shortly after 3 p.m. ET, and service appeared to be mostly restored roughly two hours later, according to outage tracking site Downdetector.com. A Zoom spokesperson said the company was aware that “some users are experiencing an outage” in an email to CNN, but did not provide a cause for the issues. At 4:52 p.m. ET, a post from Zoom’s X account said service had been restored. At its height, Downdetector.com showed more than 60,000 outage reports Wednesday afternoon. By 4:43 p.m., outage reports plummeted to below 10,000 and continued to taper off throughout the afternoon. The outage was met with a mix of celebration and complaints on social media, with some remote workers cheering the cancellation of their afternoon meetings. “Shoutout to Zoom for being down when I really didn’t want to go to a 4pm meeting,” one user posted on X. “Zoom is down. No more work today,” another person quipped. Zoom is one of the most popular web conferencing tools, having risen to popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to web conferencing, it also offers office team collaboration software. Earlier Wednesday, the music streaming app Spotify also experienced issues, with some users reporting being unable to stream audio. The issues were resolved by midday Wednesday, according to a post by Spotify on X. This story has been updated with additional context and developments.",,0.28717681765556335
"Google has illegally built “monopoly power” with its web advertising business, a federal judge in Virginia has ruled, siding with the Justice Department in a landmark case against the tech giant that could reshape the basic economics of running a modern website. The ruling that Google violated antitrust law marks the US government’s second major court victory over Google in less than a year amid claims the company has illegally monopolized key parts of the internet ecosystem, including online search. And it is the third such decision since a federal jury in December 2023 found that Google’s proprietary app store is also an illegal monopoly. Taken together, the trio of decisions highlights the breadth of trouble Google faces, raising the prospect of sweeping penalties that could reshape multiple aspects of its business, though ongoing and expected appeals will likely take years to play out. Thursday’s decision by District Judge Leonie Brinkema, of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, addresses the $31 billion portion of Google’s ad business that matches website publishers with advertisers. This “stack” of technologies determines what banner ads appear on countless sites across the web. The Justice Department’s lawsuit followed years of criticism that Google’s extensive role in the digital ecosystem that enables advertisers to place ads, and for publishers to offer up digital ad space, represented a conflict of interest that Google exploited anticompetitively. Related article
      DOJ sues Google over its dominance in online advertising market Brinkema sided with the Justice Department’s argument that by tying its ad server and publisher ad exchange together, Google was able to “establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets, she wrote in her 115-page decision. But she also struck down one of the government’s claims related to Google’s online advertiser ad networks. “We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” Google’s Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a statement following the decision. “The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don’t harm competition,” Mullholland said. “We disagree with the Court’s decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.” The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Google had argued that the Justice Department’s argument is “flawed” and would “slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow,” according to a statement from a company spokesperson after the lawsuit was filed in 2023. However, Brinkema argued in her decision that Google’s practices have deprived “rivals of the ability to compete” and “substantially harmed Google’s publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web.” The decision could force Google to divest part of its online ad business. But the fact that the government did not win on all of its claims makes that outcome less likely, said William Kovacic, global competition professor of law and policy at The George Washington University Law School. “The general idea in other antitrust cases is that the remedy has to be proportional,” Kovacic said. “The broader the finding of illegality, the deeper the finding of deliberateness… the greater the platform for a bolder remedy.” Still, he said, Google could get stuck with a conduct remedy — such as restrictions on how it can operate or price its services — “that would not be good for them.” Some tech critics and media organizations cheered the ruling. “For years, Google wielded unchecked monopoly power over the digital advertising market – using it to suffocate the media industry and force middleman taxes on everything we buy online,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, who called the decision an “unequivocal win for the American people.” Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement Thursday that the decision is “a big win in the fight to break up Big Tech … the result of years of work to rein in tech companies’ abuses.” The decision is part of a wider push by regulators to check the power of large tech companies including Apple, Meta and Amazon in addition to Google parent Alphabet. Just this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand in a trial over a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit in which the US Federal Trade Commission accused the social media giant of buying would-be competitors to stifle competition. Thursday’s decision, Kovacic said, could “lend impetus” to efforts around the world to crack down on Google and other tech giants and “give them confidence to push ahead.” –This story has been updated with additional details and context.

"President Donald Trump on Thursday ratcheted up his criticism against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling for his “termination” for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. His comments come one day after the central bank chief delivered a stark warning about the effect of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on the economy. Trump’s first comments on Powell came early in the day, in a social media post. But the president continued ripping into the Fed chief later Thursday, in an Oval Office meeting, piling on political pressure for Powell to lower interest rates. Ahead of an expected rate decision Thursday by the European Central Bank, Trump lashed out at the Fed leader, saying the US central bank is lagging behind. The ECB later announced it is cutting interest rates for the seventh time in the past year. “Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete ‘mess!’ Trump wrote. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” His comments come after Powell on Wednesday said at an event in Chicago that the Trump administration has brought “very fundamental policy changes,” including sweeping tariffs that are “significantly larger than anticipated.” He said such changes are unlike anything seen in modern history, putting the Fed in uncharted waters and on a path to confront a challenge it hasn’t seen in decades.

      Fed Chair Powell gives starkest warning yet on potential economic consequences from tariffs But Powell’s words weren’t unlike those of other Fed officials in recent weeks. Most have said Trump’s tariffs are likely to push up inflation and unemployment. Powell has carried out the Fed’s monetary policy by making decisions that are dependent on economic data in striving for the central bank’s dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. The ECB, which only focuses on price stability, also has a data-driven approach like the Fed. “Let me just say very squarely, I have a lot of respect for my esteemed colleague and friend Jay Powell. We have a steady solid relationship amongst central bankers,” ECB President Christine Lagarde said Thursday in a news conference after the central bank announced its latest policy move. “I think that relationship is decisive in order to have a solid financial infrastructure on which to ensure there is financial stability.” Meanwhile, some billionaires, such as Ray Dalio, have taken criticism of Trump’s tariffs a step further, saying the US economy might be in or near a recession already. Powell was first appointed as Fed chair by Trump in 2018 and was later reappointed by President Joe Biden in 2022. His current term ends in May 2026. Trump has on several occasions threatened to remove Powell from his post, and criticism of his Fed head stretches back to 2018, when Powell took the reins of the world’s most powerful central bank. The Fed raised interest rates a handful of times that year over worries that a historically tight job market could spur higher inflation. In 2019, Trump even called Powell “the enemy.” In March 2020, Trump told reporters he had the “right to remove (Powell) as chairman” and that “he has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion,” after markets tanked amid the pandemic. But he also praised Powell for cutting rates to zero to prevent an economic collapse. Powell will be ‘out of there real fast if I want him out,’ Trump says Trump doubled down on his criticism of Powell while taking questions from reporters in the Oval Office Thursday afternoon. “I don’t think he’s doing the job. He’s too late. Always too late. A little slow and I’m not happy with him. I let him know it,” Trump said. “And if I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me.” “We have a Federal Reserve chairman that’s playing politics,” he said, adding that the Fed not cutting interest rates “plays right into (Europe’s) hands.” “The Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down, that’s the only thing he’s good for,” Trump said. “I think at some point he will. He’s going to have a lot of political pressure, you know they are political also and I think there’s a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates.” The Fed declined to comment on Trump’s latest remarks. But Trump’s desire to fire Powell is at odds with the view of his own Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Earlier this week, Bessent told Bloomberg in an interview that “monetary policy is a jewel box that’s got to be preserved.” During his confirmation hearing in January, Bessent told congressional lawmakers that the Fed should remain independent. Doing away with it would not only rattle investors who are already anxious about Trump’s tariffs, but it could destroy the central bank’s credibility, which it needs to fight inflation. That’s as important as ever, with economists expecting tariffs to lead to higher prices. Countries with independent central banks generally have lower inflation. Can Trump fire Powell? For his part, Powell has pointedly noted that removing a Fed chair is “not permitted under the law,” and has said he intends to serve out the remainder of his term. However, that legal protection, which comes as a result of the Fed’s status as an independent government institution, may be an open question. Trump has fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, also a long-independent agency, arguing that their “continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration’s priorities,” according to a Wall Street Journal report of a letter Trump sent to them. On Wednesday, Trump fired two Democrats on the three-member board of the National Credit Union Administration, a federal insurer and regulator of credit unions. Todd Harper, one of the officials dismissed by Trump, said in a post on LinkedIn that his firing “is wrong.” Related article
      Stocks are mixed as Trump lashes out at Powell “It violates the bipartisan statutory framework adopted by Congress to protect credit union members and their deposits. The Trump Administration’s attack also undermines the independence, balance and important work of the NCUA,” Harper wrote. “If a President can fire an NCUA Board member at any time, how will we maintain public trust in our nation’s financial services regulatory system?” Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is expected to revisit a case that could severely weaken the Fed’s independence. The 1935 case, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, established precedent over how much power a sitting US president has in removing agency heads. The case involved William Humphrey, “an aggrieved conservative commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, who was fired by Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 over policy differences,” the Brookings Institution wrote in a 2018 analysis. Humphrey died shortly after his dismissal, but his executor sued for damages. The Court ruled in favor of the executor, saying the Constitution does not say the president has the “illimitable power of removal.” In February, the Trump administration said the case should be overturned. In addition to the FTC firings, Trump also fired a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board and another person serving on the Merit Systems Protection Board who identifies as a Democrat — both who have sued for their jobs back. Chief Justice John Roberts asked both sides to submit briefs last week.",,0.20471180975437164
"President Donald Trump on Thursday again made clear his disdain for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, going so far as to say the central banker’s “termination can’t come fast enough” and saying in an Oval Office event that Powell will “be out of there real fast” if he wants. While many experts say the president does not in fact have the power to fire the Fed chief due to policy differences, Trump has made clear he’s willing to break with norms and precedent, even in the face of potentially monumental repercussions. Regardless, the leading contender to lead the US central bank under Trump, whether at the end of Powell’s term in May 2026 or earlier, reportedly appears to be Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who previously was under consideration to be Trump’s Treasury secretary for the president’s second term and was a candidate for the top job at the Fed during Trump’s first term. CNN previously reported that Warsh was again on Trump’s shortlist to become Fed chair this time around, once Powell’s time is up. In fact, Trump’s selection of Scott Bessent to lead the Treasury Department was seen by many as a way to leave Warsh open for an eventual appointment as Fed chair. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this week that the administration will start interviewing candidates for Powell’s successor “sometime in the fall.” And with speculation swirling over whether Trump will try to oust Powell before his term ends, Bessent said that “monetary policy is a jewel box that’s got to be preserved.” But who is the man who might soon lead one of the world’s most powerful financial institutions? The man who could be the next Fed chair Warsh, 55, was a vice president and executive director at Morgan Stanley in the company’s mergers and acquisitions division before serving as a special assistant to then-President George Bush for economic policy and as executive secretary at the National Economic Council. Like Powell, Warsh does not have a graduate degree in economics. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1995. Related article
      Can Trump fire Jerome Powell? The Supreme Court may soon offer some clues Bush appointed Warsh to the Fed’s Board of Governors in 2006, where he served during the height of the Great Recession as chief liaison to Wall Street. In that role, he helped coordinate the sale of Bear Sterns to JPMorgan Chase. But he also allowed Lehman Brothers to go under in 2008, a watershed moment for global financial markets. Warsh resigned from the Fed in 2011 after publicly voicing his opposition to the central bank’s plan to buy $600 billion worth of bonds to inject more money into the economy. More recently, Warsh advised Trump’s transition team on economic policy after the November election. In a January opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, he joined Trump in criticizing the Fed for letting inflation rise sharply during and after the pandemic. Warsh currently serves as a distinguished economics fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank; and is a visiting scholar at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. Additionally, he is a member of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s panel of advisers. He is married to billionaire Jane Lauder, granddaughter of Estée Lauder, the late cosmetics industry mogul. His views on economic events and the Fed In his Wall Street Journal op-ed, Warsh wrote that high inflation rates over the past few years arose from “a government that spent too much and a central bank that printed too much.” However, most mainstream economists attribute inflation’s eruption in 2021 mostly to pandemic-induced shocks to demand and supply. Warsh wrote that “the Fed should steer clear of political prognostications, not just in word but in deed,” pointing to minutes from a Fed meeting last year indicating officials believed Trump’s proposed policies could fuel inflation. In an interview with Fox Business ahead of the Fed’s latest policy meeting last month, Warsh said the turmoil sparked by Trump’s tariff war indicates an economy that “is transitioning.” “The president inherited a fiscal and economic and regulatory mess, and it’s going to take a little digging out to be on a stronger platform for growth,” he said. “Rome wasn’t built in a day, so this will take some time.” When asked about the likelihood of Trump’s tariffs stoking inflation, Warsh said that “inflation is a choice, and the Fed has made a lot of bad choices over these last several years.” “The president has to take matters into this own hands and try to kill inflation by reducing government spending,” he said.",,0.34748029708862305
"A Sam Altman-backed company has an ambitious plan to solve one of the internet’s trickiest problems — distinguishing humans from artificial bots. It involves an Orb. The Orb couldn’t verify me as a “unique human” when I tried it — but it turns out, that’s partially by design. I wear blue-light blocking contacts with a slight yellow tint, so the Orb evidently thought I was trying to fool it by disguising my identity. “Well, that’s sad, but I’m grateful that it rejected you,” Tiago Sada, chief product officer at the company behind the Orb, told me after the tool returned a message saying, “something is blocking your face.” The Orb, built by Tools for Humanity, which Altman co-founded, wants to provide what it says is a more effective identity verification method in the age of artificial intelligence. Related article
      Sam Altman, AI’s biggest star, sure hopes someone figures out how not to destroy humanity Now that AI systems can understand images, for example, it’s no longer just humans who can pick out the photos of school buses on traditional CAPTCHA systems. And cracking down on bots is crucial as fake accounts have become more prominent everywhere from ticket sales websites to dating apps. What’s more, armies of bots can be used to spread harassment or disinformation campaigns on social media, and AI scams are already proving costly for victimized families and companies. “Every single time, for any artist around the world, tickets go live, bots go and buy tickets and they drive up the prices,” Sada said. “I’m on dating apps all the time, and probably every week I come across an account that I’m like, ‘Oh, why does this person have six fingers?’ Well, turns out it was an AI.” Still, convincing large numbers of people to let a gleaming, sci-fi-looking Orb photograph their faces to confirm their humanity and enable bot-free online spaces may be a tall order. Already, several places have banned the project over privacy and other concerns, including the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. And some critics say the Orb is part of an AI future being pushed by tech leaders like Altman that not everyone wants. But Sada said he believes the need for the service is already apparent. “Every single website, whether it’s finance, social media, commerce, whatever, we think of proof of human is super relevant.” How the Orb works When a user scans their face with the Orb, the technology photographs their eyes and face to analyze things like dimension and how they react to light, Sada said. When the Orb has verified a user’s “humanness,” it sends a unique code, or “WorldID,” to an app on their phone. The idea is that WorldID would serve as a sort of digital passport to verify users’ identities across a range of online services. It’s sort of like Face ID, but without requiring an iPhone and potentially applicable across more services. Sada envisions, for example, that if a bank wanted to confirm a customer’s identity before divulging financial information, it could use your WorldID rather than security questions, which may be easier for a scammer to guess. Currently, there are few practical use cases for WorldID. But it can be used in a limited fashion on some platforms, including Reddit and Shopify, where users can access “human-only” subreddits or retail deals, Sada said. More than 12 million people have already verified their identity using Orbs, which are available and free to use in more than 20 countries at malls and other central locations or at Tools for Humanity events. Later this year, the company plans to roll out a service to deliver Orbs directly to people’s homes for easier verification, starting in Latin America. The Orb is temporarily unavailable in the United States while the technology is being updated, but the company says it will re-launch “soon.” The World App is still available in the meantime. Safety questions Tools for Humanity built the Orb for the “World” network, an open-source platform that serves as a sort of repository for “verified” humans. World users in some countries can buy and sell the “Worldcoin” cryptocurrency, a token only accessible to people on the network. The company has gifted some Orb users a bit of Worldcoin in exchange for photographing their faces. (CNN was not offered the cryptocurrency, which is not available in the United States, when testing the device.) The network project launched as Worldcoin in 2023, before rebranding to just “World” last year, leaving the name of the token unchanged. Leaders said the effort could help manage the “economic implications” of AI; for example, by providing a means of delivering universal basic income, an idea of which Altman is a proponent. For now, Tools for Humanity’s main source of revenue is selling or renting Orbs to World “community operators,” who earn extra Worldcoin in exchange for onboarding new users to the network, although the company said it’s exploring additional revenue streams. As with many other cryptocurrency projects, Worldcoin has drawn extra scrutiny to the project. Some skeptics raised concerns that offering users cryptocurrency in exchange for using the technology could encourage them to overlook potential privacy risks. Others worried the project could centralize too much power under Altman, who already has an outsized role in what’s expected to be a revolutionary tech transformation. Last fall’s rebrand was viewed as a likely effort to expand its identity beyond the original cryptocurrency effort. Sada says Tools for Humanity says Worldcoin gives users ownership over the World network. Tools for Humanity did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of Altman, its chairman. The Orb also faces ongoing scrutiny from privacy regulators in Europe and elsewhere, given that it works by collecting sensitive biometric data. According to Tools for Humanity, photos taken by the Orb are sent to users’ phones along with their WorldID and then are automatically deleted from the device, so the company retains no biometric data. The data is encrypted en route to users’ devices, where users can set up the app to require authentication before opening it. The company has also open-sourced much of the technology behind the Orb, an effort, it says, to allow third parties to verify its safety claims. “It’s not very intuitive that something like this is … private,” Sada said. “We think that privacy is freedom, and something like World exists first and foremost to defend people’s freedom.”",,0.23271295428276062
"Global markets have been shaken to their core by President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade agenda — and despite his promise of a “new golden age of America,” the long-held appeal of US investment is starting to lose its luster. Trump’s tariffs have been a catalyst for the end of an era of US exceptionalism, analysts say, and a dent to the image that US markets are the premier place to invest with unrivaled performance. His trade war has clouded business decisions and disrupted forecasts for economic growth. CEOs have slashed guidance and Wall Street banks have cut their year-end targets for the S&P 500. Bank of America’s latest global fund manager survey showed the largest number of global investors on record intending to decrease their holdings of US stocks since data collection began in 2001. Seventy-three percent of respondents said they think US exceptionalism has peaked. The Trump administration’s trade policy has raised concerns about US economic growth and caused global investors to rethink their allocation to US assets, Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, told CNN. “Even if there is a steady de-escalation from here, the damage is done,” Sai said. “There is no putting the genie back in the bottle.” Global markets in focus The US stock market has long been the gold standard. The S&P 500 has steadily outperformed its counterparts in Europe and Asia for the past 15 years, according to FactSet data. Yet the S&P 500 is down 10% this year and on track for its worst month since 2022. Investors are well aware that the landscape has changed tremendously since the benchmark index soared 23% across last year. There have been three catalysts that have shifted focus away from America and toward investing overseas, according to Alessio de Longis, head of investments and senior portfolio manager at Invesco. In January, DeepSeek’s low-cost, ChatGPT-like artificial intelligence model caught Silicon Valley by surprise and challenged the narrative that the US had outright dominance in AI. Related article
      Trump wants to reset world relationships with his tariffs. He might get what he wants In February, a shift in US foreign policy toward less support for Ukraine spurred defense spending in Germany, a boon for economic growth and investing in Europe. And Trump’s haphazard approach to tariffs in March and April was the third nudge for investors to look at other markets, according to de Longis. “The relatively erratic and unpredictable communication strategy around tariffs, as well as the initial shock of the amount of tariffs that were being threatened across the world provided another impetus for US underperformance,” de Longis said. In the past three months, de Longis said his investment strategy has shifted from overly-focused on US stocks in favor of a balance between US and European stocks. The latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed that for the past eight weeks, more than 50% of respondents have been bearish on the US stock market. Jason Blackwell, chief investment strategist at Focus Partners Wealth, said it has likely been 15 years since a client has asked to increase their allocation to international stocks. “That’s been a pretty consistent call that we’ve gotten over the last couple of weeks,” Blackwell said. “So, there’s definitely interest there again.” Blackwell said the advent of DeepSeek and the prospects for more growth in Europe caught investors’ attention. “Add in the tariffs on top of that, and add in this de-globalization trend, and I think you had a series of events that really had investors rethinking their international exposures and rebalancing a bit from where they have been over the last 10 years,” he said. Heading into this year, the US accounted for about 25% of global GDP and 65% of global stock market value, according to Barclays. “For nigh on 20 years, the US has benefited from almost relentless flows into USD financial assets,” said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an analyst at Barclays, in a recent note. “Perhaps we were primed for some give-back … and a bunch of things have changed elsewhere.” “Europe has finally bought in to the idea of large fiscal stimulus,” Rajadhyaksha said. “At least from a narrative standpoint, there seem to be some alternatives for international investors heavily over-exposed to the US.” Rajadhyaksha also said that businesses in China have made “impressive strides” in technology beyond DeepSeek, noting that there have been breakthroughs by Huawei and electric vehicle company BYD, which rivals Tesla in the global market. The Chinese government has also recently embraced its private tech sector. Shaken confidence Bank of America’s fund manager survey in April showed 49% of respondents think the global economy is on track for a “hard landing,” up from 11% in March. Gold has soared almost 27% this year, smashing through record highs as investors flock to safe haven assets. The most crowded trade in April was gold, according to Bank of America’s survey, breaking a two-year streak of the most crowded trade being the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. Meanwhile, the US dollar has broadly weakened this year, a potential sign of waning investor confidence in the US. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six major foreign currencies, recently posted its worst week since 2022. The Euro last week hit its strongest level against the dollar in over three years. Related article
      The bond market is acting weird. It spooked Trump “We have previously argued that exceptional US asset return prospects are responsible for the dollar’s strong valuation,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a recent note. “If tariffs weigh on US firms’ profit margins and US consumers’ real incomes, like we think they will, they can erode that exceptionalism and, in turn, crack the central pillar of the strong dollar.” Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, said in a note that “recent market action shows a loss of confidence in Trump economic policy,” citing higher Treasury yields and a weaker dollar. Trump’s yearning for a domestic manufacturing renaissance portends to disrupt the global economy — a deeply intertwined system where the United States has enjoyed the center stage. The Trump administration’s adamance on changing the international trading system and global economic order has likely contributed to fewer inflows to US assets, according to Pictet Asset Management’s Sai. While the US stock market remains a viable place to invest for the long term, Sai said, investors are seeking out stocks overseas to diversify their portfolios amid tariff whiplash and broad uncertainty. JP Morgan is forecasting a 60% chance of a global recession this year. “If you’re a European investor, you will now think twice about allocating strategically to the US,” Sai said. “The S&P 500 is no longer the only game in town.”",,0.2722969949245453
"The revelation that President Trump’s aides endangered national security by chatting about a military strike in a Signal chat that included a journalist is embarrassing for everyone involved – which is why it’s a big test of MAGA media’s power to deny, dismiss and deflect. The president’s favorite media outlets are mostly downplaying the story and deriding the reporter who was invited to the group chat, The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg. On X, Elon Musk and his acolytes are cracking jokes about the scandal. And some pro-Trump outlets are trying to ignore it altogether. It’s all reminiscent of Trump’s first term, when real news stories were rejected by right-wing opinion outlets time and time again. And as we learned back then, the president’s media consumption has a huge impact on the personnel and policy decisions he makes. So far, the advice he’s getting from his Fox News friends is to weather the current storm. Many pro-Trump media figures are taking their cues from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who sounded like he reverted to his former role as Fox host when he blasted Goldberg as a “discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes.” Hegseth likely used the word “hoax” strategically since it viscerally appeals to Trump. The president has a long history of trying to disarm damaging stories by claiming they are “hoaxes,” regardless of reality. The word has become a signal to Trump fans to tune out distressing stories. Some on the right saw right through the rhetorical trick. “Oh for God’s sake,” Fox chief political analyst Brit Hume wrote on X, “the administration has already confirmed the authenticity of the message.” Hegseth’s insistence that “nobody was texting war plans” was also refuted by Goldberg, who told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “That’s a lie. He was texting war plans. He was texting attack plans.” Goldberg acted patriotically (and protected himself legally) by choosing not to publish those specific texts. But Hegseth’s denial was a lifeline to MAGA media commentators who are now saying there is a dispute over the facts. Monday night on Fox News, the dominant pro-Trump network in the United States, Sean Hannity seethed about “media hysteria.” Laura Ingraham pooh-poohed the story by saying “left-wing networks” cared about it. Jesse Watters’ show said “WE’VE ALL TEXTED THE WRONG PERSON BEFORE.” The Watters segment prompted Issac Saul, who runs Tangle News, to say “it’s really hard to do any kind of political analysis without constantly grappling with the fact that our two political tribes are just living in completely and utterly different information ecosystems.” On Tuesday morning, the “Fox & Friends” morning show led with some counter-programming: A segment on deportations. When the show reported on the war plans leak later in the hour, Steve Doocy took a somewhat hard line, saying “what was revealed was classified and top secret.” Guest host Kayleigh McEnany said it was “an obvious mistake,” but then heaped doubt on Goldberg’s depiction of events, saying “he is not a credible reporter.” Then Lawrence Jones said “literally my only question” is how Goldberg got on the Signal chain. All in all, it was very gentle treatment of a glaring security breach. Breitbart and other MAGA media voices have also attacked the messenger and suggested that media reports don’t matter much anymore, anyway. This is the same approach Trump White House officials and outside advisers are taking. On Tuesday morning, Axios quoted an anonymous Trump adviser saying “we don’t care what the media says” and predicting “this will blow over.” The president, however, has a reputation for caring deeply about media coverage. On Tuesday morning, he gave a phone interview to NBC News, an outlet he criticized just a few days ago, about the Signal scandal. (Trump expressed support for embattled national security adviser Michael Waltz.) Goldberg’s story, meanwhile, remains the #1 most-read piece on The Atlantic’s website. In a Q&A with a colleague, Goldberg said he is unperturbed about possible retaliation from the Trump administration. “Unfortunately, in our society today — we see this across corporate journalism and law firms and other industries — there’s too much preemptive obeying for my taste,” Goldberg said. “All we can do is just go do our jobs.”",,0.3582518398761749
"When Target announced on January 24 that it would scale back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) commitments, customers reacted swiftly, upset that a company that had so loudly touted its diversity initiatives appeared to be backtracking. For 10 consecutive weeks, foot traffic at Target stores has declined — down 9% year-over-year in February and 6.5% year-over-year in March, according to data from analytics firm Placer.ai. While Placer.ai notes a variety of factors were likely to blame, like weather and a drop in post-holiday spending, Rev. Jamal Bryant has driven another reason for a drop-off: a fast — from shopping. Bryant, the senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church near Atlanta, spearheaded a 40-day “fast” from shopping at the big-box store during Lent (March 5 to April 17). The Target Fast boycott had more than 200,000 participants, he said. Target is just one of the companies now walking a tightrope, balancing the demands of President Donald Trump to end diversity efforts with what customers might want from the corporations they do business with. “They hear me. The cash register hears me,” Bryant told CNN. “Power concedes nothing without a demand.” The pressure is particularly acute at companies like Target, that had previously championed diversity in hiring and in sourcing their products. Already, Bryant said, Target has ceded to one demand. After meeting with Target CEO Brian Cornell on Thursday, Bryant announced Sunday that Target agreed to honor its pledge to spend $2 billion with Black-owned businesses — a commitment initially made in 2021. But that’s not enough. Bryant called for the boycott to continue and hopes Cornell will attend a town hall on Tuesday to address community concerns. Target did not respond to CNN’s latest request for comment. The stakes are high for Target: Black Americans are expected to have a buying power of $2 trillion by 2026, up from $1.7 trillion in 2024, according to a report from The Nielsen Company. “We saw (Target) as a friend. They championed diversity,” Bryant told CNN. “So, we were in shock and awe when they reversed what is their stance and position.” A pressure campaign from all sides Just four days into Trump’s presidency, Target announced it was eliminating hiring goals for minority employees, ending an executive committee focused on racial justice and making other changes to its diversity initiatives. Target said it had a new strategy called “Belonging at the Bullseye,” which it first introduced last year, and the company remained committed to “creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities.” Target also stressed the need for “staying in step with the evolving external landscape.” Target is one of dozens of Fortune 500 companies that have backtracked on DEI in response to conservative court decisions, pressure from right-wing activists and legal groups, and, more recently, the Trump administration’s threats to investigate what it characterizes as “illegal DEI,” including potential criminal cases against companies. Trump in particular has railed against diversity efforts, including signing an executive action on his first day in office entitled “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing.” But no company has faced as fierce a blowback from DEI supporters as Target. Customers online have protested the decision, and Anne and Lucy Dayton, the daughters of one of Target’s co-founders, called the company’s actions “a betrayal.” Target is under more pressure than companies like Walmart, John Deere or Tractor Supply, because Target went further in its DEI efforts, and it has a more progressive base of customers than those competitors. Target was a leading advocate for DEI programs in the business world in the years after George Floyd was killed by a police officer in the company’s home city of Minneapolis in 2020. Target also spent years building a public reputation as a progressive employer on LGBTQ issues. Cornell defended the company’s diversity initiatives in 2023, attributing it to company growth in recent years and noting that the measures have helped Target add value, drive sales and build “greater engagement with both our teams and our guests.” The blowback to Target’s DEI moves represents a significant challenge to its business and highlights the risks of companies abruptly moving away from diversity initiatives that still enjoy support on the left. Boycotting a large business, hurting small ones Bryant has called on consumers to buy directly from Black-owned businesses and sell their Target stock, adding to the retailer’s struggles at a time when investors were concerned about global trade tensions and economic uncertainty. Target said in February that it continues to offer products from Black-owned and minority-owned businesses, adding that its Black History Month offerings were available in stores and online. But decreased spending at Target overall also means that minority-owned businesses on store shelves are earning far less. On Friday, Bryant’s church opened the “Bullseye Black Market,” a marketplace with over 100 Black-owned businesses — some of which are currently sold at Target. It was available to the public until Sunday, when Bryant said the boycott would continue. In partnership with other churches, marketplaces opened in Chicago, Dallas, Houston and New York. Chantel Powell, founder of Play Pits, a body care brand that has been on Target shelves since 2022, said store sales are down 30% from 2024. But there’s also been an increase in sales directly through her website, which she said shows “people are being more intentional about where they spend their dollars.” “It felt like Target was for us. It felt like Target believed in us, and it wasn’t because it was a trend,” she said. Target changing its DEI stance “felt like a rug pull,” said Carlton Mackey, founder of apparel brand Black Men Smile. In 2024, his products were part of Target’s Black History Month collection and sold in all 1,900 stores. Now, he says that he can’t stand in solidarity with the company because of the DEI pullback. The policy changes haven’t scared off everyone yet. Patrice Chappelle, co-founder of MelanBrand Skin, told CNN that she wanted to join Target’s Forward Founder program, which was previously for “historically under resourced founders.” Now she says her business has been “set back tremendously.” “I hope that one day when they turn things around, we can still get into Target, but I know right now it’s not gonna be any time soon,” she said.

"One of the international broadcasters targeted for termination by President Donald Trump has been granted a reprieve by a federal judge. US District Judge Royce C. Lamberth has granted Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s request for a temporary restraining order that will help the broadcaster stay on the air and online for the time being. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty filed suit last week to contest Trump’s shutdown order, claiming it “would violate the Constitution and federal laws.” Judge Lamberth heard arguments on Monday. Just before the hearing, the Trump administration agreed to pay what it owes Radio Free Europe for the first half of March. But it continued to defend the termination order that took effect March 15. “We’re confident the law is on our side as the US Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power of the purse,” Radio Free Europe CEO Stephen Capus said in a statement after the hearing. “It is unlawful to deny us the funds that Congress has already appropriated to RFE/RL for the rest of this fiscal year.” Judge Lamberth signaled agreement in his restraining order against the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM for short) on Tuesday. “RFE/RL has, for decades, operated as one of the organizations that Congress has statutorily designated to carry out this policy. The leadership of USAGM cannot, with one sentence of reasoning offering virtually no explanation, force RFE/RL to shut down — even if the President has told them to do so,” Lamberth wrote. The order means that the broadcaster is likely to succeed on the merits of the broader case. Lamberth said he intends to rule “expeditiously” and told the parties to file briefings before the court later this week. Multiple other lawsuits over Trump’s action to dismantle the US  Agency for Global Media are also pending. Last week several Voice of America journalists, along with multiple unions and the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, filed a suit alleging the shutdown of VOA was unlawful and unconstitutional. “The long-term consequences of silencing VOA will reverberate globally, eroding the influence and moral authority of the United States,” VOA’s sidelined chief national correspondent Steve Herman said at a press conference Monday. A judge will hear arguments in the VOA case on Friday. A representative for the agency did not respond to a request for comment. Capus addressed the ruling by saying that “we appreciate Judge Lamberth’s thoughtful and airtight ruling to prevent USAGM from ignoring the will of Congress.” He added, “This ruling further sends a strong message to our journalists around the world: Their mission as designed by Congress is a worthy and valuable one and should continue.” The judge’s ruling may bode well for the other international broadcasters that are trying to stay on the air despite Trump’s order. Radio Free Asia has furloughed much of its staff and cut back on its daily news coverage while trying to conserve its remaining funds. An executive at the network told CNN that it is also preparing to sue over the grant termination.",,0.27263855934143066
"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday used a DOGE subcommittee hearing to call for the defunding and dismantling of the company that provides NPR and PBS with federal funds. For Taylor Greene and other House Republicans, today’s hearing was about tarnishing PBS and NPR with accusations of bias and targeting them for defunding. For the broadcasters, today was about defending their existence. The hearing, titled “Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,” started at 10 am ET, and featured testimony from NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger, as well as a local station operator and a conservative critic of taxpayer-funded media. The hearing, which was chaired by Taylor Greene, was meant to advance long-held Republican arguments against PBS and NPR, including that their programming is “communist.” In the final minutes of the two-hour hearing that saw repeated conservative attacks on the public broadcasters, Taylor Greene said that “we can look no further than the Corporation for Public Broadcasting” as the culprit for US debt. “After listening to what we’ve heard, today, we will be calling for the complete and total defund and dismantling of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” Taylor Greene said. President Donald Trump on said Tuesday that the networks are a “waste of money” and claimed “he would love to” defund them. And yet the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump earlier this month included $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations. Congress budgets money for CPB two years in advance, so the recent bill means public broadcasting is funded through 2027. Congressional sparring Throughout the hearing, legislators pressed Maher and Kruger on their roles in allegedly circulating disinformation, accusing the pair of fostering newsrooms that cater to elite audiences. “NPR and PBS have increasingly become radical left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy, white urban liberals and progressives who generally look down on and judge rural America,” Taylor Greene said at the hearing’s overture before accusing the pair of “grooming and sexualizing” children, using DEI for listener demographics, and wasting taxpayer dollars. Maher and Kruger also faced attacks from Rep. James Comer, who, in addition to accusing NPR and PBS of peddling “disinformation” and “propaganda,” claimed the public broadcasters are obsolete in an age marked by a “menu of media options” that includes podcasts and satellite radio. Congressional Republicans repeatedly peppered Maher and Kruger with accusations regarding their coverage of the COVID-19 origins lab leak theory, Russian collusion, and Hunter Biden’s laptop. Maher said that the public broadcaster was “mistaken” in “failing” to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story sooner and more aggressively. When Cloud asked Maher about the lab leak theory, the NPR boss emphasized that the outlet’s current editorial leadership recognizes that “the new CIA evidence is worthy of coverage,” stressing that it has reported just that. Local needs Maher and Kruger spent the two-hour hearing defending their respective organizations, pushing back against conservative claims by stressing that most Americans trust public broadcasters to service local communities and provide a wide variety of reporting and educational programming. To elucidate her point, Maher noted that more than 60% of all Americans — and more than half of Republicans — trust public broadcasting to deliver fact-based news. Kruger noted “there’s nothing more American than PBS as a membership organization.” Local TV and radio stations also used the opportunity to justify their federal funding. From North Country Public Radio in upstate New York, to New Mexico PBS in Albuquerque, to Hawaiʻi Public Radio in Honolulu, publicly supported stations are using the right’s political attacks to galvanize grassroots support and raise money from donors. Hawaiʻi Public Radio CEO Meredith Artley, the former editor in chief of CNN Digital, wrote that her news and classical music stations are “94% community supported,” with the remaining 6% coming from CPB. If the federal funds were diminished, the Hawaii stations would survive, but “there would likely be damage to the nationwide system that provides programming and infrastructure that HPR and many other stations rely on,” she wrote. That’s the key point: It’s a system. And smaller stations tend to need more help from the system. At KTOO Public Media in Alaska, for example, fully 30% of the budget comes from CPB. “This federal funding is essential in ensuring that Juneau’s only local-owned newsroom can continue to deliver you the news from our community,” the station said. Congressional Democrats came to the public broadcasters’ aid throughout the hearing, stressing that journalism and the free press are currently under attack by “extremists” and are needed “more than ever.” “Public broadcasting is a tool for education, for emergencies, and a cherished part of our national fabric,” Rep. Robert Garcia said. “The majority and our chairwoman should drop this attempt to silence media voices they don’t like.” Rep. Greg Casar chastised the committee for focusing on defunding NPR and PBS instead of DOGE’s head, Elon Musk, whose companies — which include X, SpaceX, Tesla, and Starlink — make billions each year while still taking home $3 billion per year in government contracts. “That’s six times the money that goes to all of public broadcasting. Private insurers and Medicare Advantage overcharged taxpayers $83 billion,” Casar said. “Just last year, that could pay for public broadcasting 160 times over.” “To borrow a phrase from Sesame Street, the letter of the day is C and it stands for corruption,” he said. Press freedom groups have also defended the public broadcasters. Ahead of the hearing, the Center for Democracy & Technology’s president and chief executive, Alexandra Reeve Givens, called the meeting an attempt by the Trump administration “to bully their perceived enemies and silence legitimate journalism.” Reporters Without Borders executive director Clayton Weimars said he was “deeply concerned the House hearing on bias in NPR and PBS is a political stunt that will create a slippery slope towards politicians dictating the programming of public news outlets.” Stations large and small also highlighted their local responsibilities. “Whatever happens in Washington, DC — WQED is not going anywhere,” Jason Jedlinski, CEO of Pittsburgh’s PBS station, wrote on LinkedIn. His post listed recent features (segments about a local farm, a reading club, and so on) that, quite frankly, few other media outlets would spend time on.",,0.27341601252555847
"A federal judge sided with silenced Voice of America journalists on Friday, the latest setback for President Trump’s push to shut down US government-funded international broadcasters. US District Court Judge J. Paul Oetken issued a temporary restraining order meant to block any further efforts to terminate VOA. The judge found that the executive branch “is usurping Congress’s power of the purse and its legislative supremacy” by scrapping a congressionally chartered agency. The restraining order means that the judge believes the VOA journalists are likely to prevail on the merits of the case. Andrew G. Celli Jr., an attorney for the VOA journalists who filed suit, said that “this is a decisive victory for press freedom and the First Amendment, and a sharp rebuke to an Administration that has shown utter disregard for the principles that define our democracy.” For now Voice of America is still offline and off the air, but Celli said “we are prepared for the next battle,” and other lawsuits against the shutdown are looming. Trump said two weeks ago that he wanted VOA’s parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, eliminated “to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.” His pick to run VOA, failed Arizona gubernatorial and US Senate candidate Kari Lake, immediately put VOA’s entire workforce on administrative leave and pulled funding from every other US-backed broadcaster. But now the law is catching up, and many of the initial impacts have been reversed, at least for the time being. This week Radio Marti, which broadcasts into Cuba, resumed radio and TV transmissions after dozens of employees at the government’s Office of Cuba Broadcasting were allowed back to work. A few dozen other US Agency for Global Media employees have also been brought back from administrative leave as Lake and her allies figure out next steps, including laying off some of the people currently on leave. The Trump administration decided to take drastic action against the broadcasters – like turning off Radio Marti altogether – and then piece things back together. At least two judges have ruled against the administration and lent support to the embattled networks, which have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades up until now. Other than Voice of America and Radio Marti, the US-backed broadcasters are private, nonprofit entities that rely on grant money from the government, but have a degree of separation. Lake tried to terminate the grants, and three of the networks filed suit to stop her. The first network to sue, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL for short, was granted a temporary restraining order by a judge earlier this week. The agency subsequently said it would restore some funding. It notified the Open Technology Fund, which also sued, of the same intent. But staffers at the networks, who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity, said they expect the Trump administration to keep trying to pull the proverbial plugs. “We’re all just wondering what their next moves will be,” one of the staffers said. Keeping the networks on the air and online is what “Congress intended,” RFE/RL CEO Steve Capus said in a statement Thursday. Capus indicated that Lake has not been in touch with network leadership – a point also emphasized by sources at other US-backed broadcasters. “We are eager to speak directly with USAGM leadership about the extraordinary and cost-effective work that RFE/RL performs for the American people,” Capus said. On Friday, RFE/RL said it would continue to pursue its court case while awaiting the promised funding. Another broadcaster, Radio Free Asia, filed a lawsuit Thursday, with the hope that the suit will trigger the restoration of its funds, too. Given all the uncertainty, the broadcasters are operating in diminished fashion right now. A notice on Radio Free Asia’s home page notes that “we are now operating with fewer staff.” Furloughs are also set to take effect at Radio Free Europe. The broadcasters provide news and current affairs coverage around the world, particularly in countries that are saturated by propaganda and starved for independent news coverage. Radio Free Asia CEO Bay Fang said her network “remains committed to fulfilling its Congressional mandate of providing a voice that counters the propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party and other authoritarian regimes in Asia.”",,0.3113551139831543
"The White House Correspondents’ Association is reversing course and canceling its plans to have comedian Amber Ruffin headline this year’s annual fundraising dinner in Washington, DC. Instead, the association says it will celebrate the First Amendment and the free press. “At this consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists,” the association’s president, Eugene Daniels, wrote in a memo Saturday. He said the association’s board voted unanimously to make the change, and did not immediately announce any new speakers. The change is a tacit acknowledgment of the growing tensions between the association — which represents White House correspondents from dozens of news outlets — and President Donald Trump. The event typically features comedians, who often use the forum to roast the guests, particularly those holding office. Presidents have traditionally given light-hearted remarks at the dinner. Last year’s dinner featured remarks by “Saturday Night Live” comedian Colin Jost and then-President Joe Biden, who took jabs at Trump and poked fun at his own age. Trump skipped the annual dinner during his first four years in office and was expected to snub it again this April. Some members of the association were privately concerned about the optics of a comedian who is harshly critical of Trump serving as the evening’s entertainment, televised and streamed live in prime time. It was easy to predict the aftermath — denunciations from the right, free-speech defenses from the left — which is what happened when Trump was roasted by comedian Michelle Wolf in 2018. The association has been under severe pressure this year as the Trump White House has banned The Associated Press from some events and taken control of press pool assignments, all part of a broader effort to assert power and clamp down on independent news coverage. White House correspondents aren’t exactly in a celebratory mood. Meanwhile, conservative media outlets aligned with Trump have been planning their own alternative events around the April 26 dinner. Scores of media companies buy tables at the annual dinner, and many hold their own receptions surrounding the event. Daniels said Saturday that “as the date nears, I will share more details of the plans in place to honor journalistic excellence and a robust, independent media covering the most powerful office in the world.” Ruffin, who previously hosted a late-night talk show on Peacock, is featured on the Saturday night CNN program “Have I Got News for You,” which is in its second season. She was announced as this year’s dinner entertainer in February. At the time, she told CNN’s Jake Tapper that she planned to channel anti-Trump sentiments during her dinner performance. She also said, of Trump’s likely absence, “I don’t know that anyone’s looking forward to being in the same room as him.” White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich on Friday publicly called out Ruffin for her anti-Trump comments, writing on X, “What kind of responsible, sensible journalist would attend something like this? More importantly, what kind of company would sponsor such as hate-filled and violence-inspiring event?” Eschewing a comedian is in line with the association’s approach to the dinner in 2019, Trump’s third year in office, when acclaimed biographer Ron Chernow delivered a speech instead. This time around, however, Ruffin had already been booked and promoted as the evening’s headliner. Ruffin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",,0.2544124126434326
"The White House Correspondents’ Association says the Trump administration should abandon its “wrong-headed effort” to take control of the press briefing room seating chart. In a memo to its nearly 900 members on Monday, the association charged the White House with trying to “exert pressure on journalists over coverage they disagree with.” Axios and CNN reported Sunday that the White House intends to take charge of the seating assignments, bigfooting the association, which has managed the matter for decades. “The most obvious end result of this reported plan is the punishment, not elevation, of journalists,” the association’s president Eugene Daniels wrote Monday. “It’s the same at the Pentagon, where the administration removed longstanding outlets whose coverage they disagreed with for other outlets that did not regularly cover the building.” Since the beginning of Trump’s second term, Trump and his press aides have shown a clear desire to do away with White House press corps norms and traditions. The actions have all trended in the same direction: Toward promoting pro-Trump friends and punishing perceived foes. In February the White House banned The Associated Press from many presidential events, prompting The AP take legal action. The White House also began to organize the daily “press pool” of reporters who travel with Trump, bypassing the association. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has claimed she is embracing digital media and making room for more journalists, but in practice the changes have favored pro-Trump media outlets that cheerlead for Trump rather than diligently covering him. The White House’s actions have put the association in a bind. The WHCA has members from 296 news organizations, all of whom are rivals to one degree or another, but who work together to ensure independent access to the White House. The association is governed by a board of journalists who are elected by their press corps peers to carry out the responsibilities that the Trump White House is now plotting to take over. Briefing room seats, for example, are assigned by the association after considering which news outlets devote the most resources to White House coverage and have the widest reach with the public. Under both Republican and Democratic presidents, journalists from the country’s biggest TV networks, newswires, newspapers, and radio networks have been seated in the front rows. Daniels pointed out in Monday’s memo that the association has dozens of digital-only members, some of whom have briefing room seats, including conservative outlets like the Daily Caller and Newsmax. “The WHCA has previously offered, and still stands ready, to discuss with the White House how to accommodate more and different types of journalists,” Daniels wrote. But Trump allies (and some past Republican press secretaries) have been urging the administration to blow up the current system. Leavitt and her colleagues could stock the briefing room’s front rows with sycophantic figures – or move more serious questioners to the back. “For the public to get the information it needs to understand and make decisions about the most powerful office in the world, it needs news produced by experienced, professional journalists who ask tough questions and produce fair coverage,” Daniels wrote. He added, “if a White House’s goal instead is to receive ‘favorable coverage’ through easy questions, the American people lose out.” During an appearance Monday on Fox News, Leavitt said “we are seriously considering” taking charge of the briefing room seating chart. She called Daniel’s memo “unserious” and took aim at the association writ large, saying “we believe it is fundamentally, fundamentally unfair that a group of DC-based elite journalists get to choose who gets to cover the President of the United States.” However, the association welcomes new media outlets and new members all the time. And for as long as seats have been installed in the briefing room, the WHCA board has equitably assigned those seats to reflect the changing shape of the press corps. Past WHCA president Steven Portnoy wrote on X Monday that “in the 2022 review I ran, we oversaw the addition of more than a dozen new and emerging outlets” in the briefing room. “Reporters who actually cover the WH know that without these systems — arranged by a representative body with everyone’s buy-in — all would suffer,” Portnoy wrote. “So ask yourself — why would any government official seek to disrupt all that? With what expertise? To achieve what objective?”",,0.22737520933151245
"Loyal Newsmax viewers who listened to the channel’s entreaties last year and lined up to buy $10-per-share stakes in the company are feeling pretty rich right about now. Those shares are currently worth nearly $200 each. This week’s IPO has been a monumental success for the pro-Trump talk and news channel, which has long been an also-ran in a sector dominated by Fox News. Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, who is now a billionaire on paper thanks to the stock’s explosive performance, told CNN, “Last election Americans voted against the media establishment and similarly investors voted by enormously buying Newsmax stock to say they like us, they value us and they want us to grow.” Newsmax suddenly has a lot of capital to expand. But the market’s overexuberance has some media outlets calling it a “meme stock.” The stock closed Monday at $83.51 and nearly tripled in value on Tuesday to $233.00. Shares slipped in after-hours trading, however, and some market pros predicted that the stock would succumb to gravity soon enough. And investors have plenty of reason to exercise caution. The cable news landscape doesn’t exactly scream “growth.” Newsmax’s financials are dreadful. And the company faces a big legal challenge around the corner. Newsmax was motivated to raise money through an IPO partly due to the defamation lawsuits against the channel stemming from the 2020 election. Both Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic accused Newsmax and other right-wing outlets of promoting lies about imagined voter fraud when Trump was trying to overturn his 2020 election loss. There was no way Ruddy could afford anywhere near the $787.5 million that Fox paid Dominion in 2023. But what if he ran infomercials on Newsmax and convinced viewers to invest? That’s what he did in mid-2024. The entreaties were not subtle. Anchors said things like “we want you to be a co-owner” and Newsmax wants you to join us in keeping America safe and strong.” Ruddy sometimes appeared on air for the ads. He recognized a pure-play TV brand would not normally generate Wall Street excitement, so he touted Newsmax’s streaming ventures and podcasts. And he likened his IPO plans to Trump’s media company stock. Given Newsmax’s small size, weak TV ratings and history of unprofitability – it lost $72 million in 2024 – some industry onlookers were skeptical the IPO plan would work. Last summer Mediaite, citing Newsmax insiders, cast it as “an effort to stave off financial ruin as the network faces two potentially fatal defamation lawsuits.” In court last fall, a Newsmax lawyer referred to the Smartmatic case as a “bet-your-company case for Newsmax.” But the two sides ended up settling for $40 million. (Newsmax only paid half upfront. The rest is due by July. Smartmatic also had an option to buy Newsmax shares.) The settlement “and associated legal fees of $76.9 million” were a big reason why Newsmax lost money last year, according to SEC filings. But the on-air ads for the IPO were successful. The channel signed up lots of fans, in spite of the warning in its prospectus about Dominion seeking $1.6 billion in damages. A key pre-trial hearing in the Dominion case was held a week and a half ago, and a jury trial is scheduled to begin in Delaware on April 28, unless a settlement is reached. (Newsmax denies defaming anyone in 2020.) Newsmax’s TV audience remains relatively small. And anyone who tunes in can see that the programming is cheaply-produced. But maybe “Monday’s price explosion,” as Deadline called it, really will change Newsmax’s fortunes over the long term. At its current share price, Newsmax has a market cap of $20 billion, putting it within striking distance of Fox Corp, which has a market cap of $24 billion. Fox executives would scoff at the comparison, since Fox Corp is a diversified media company (with sports and other assets) and Fox News is ten times as popular as Newsmax in the daily rating race. But for the moment, retail traders are making Newsmax one of the most volatile stocks on the street. And Newsmax’s TV shows are continuing to pump up the shares. “NEWSMAX STOCK HITS $233 A SHARE,” one of the on-screen banners declared after the market closed Tuesday. It’s been “just two days,” Ruddy said during a promotional TV segment, and “it’s just amazing the amount of interest we’re getting.” Among the interested parties, he said, was President Trump, who sent him a “nice note” on Monday night “congratulating me and Newsmax on our success.”",,0.3110383152961731
"In the Trump administration’s latest assertion of power over the press corps, the White House intends to take over the seating assignments in the press briefing room, according to a senior official. The plan may cause a tug-of-war with the White House Correspondents’ Association, the independent group that currently assigns seats and manages the relationship between the White House and the press corps. When Axios reported on the potential seating chart changes on Sunday morning, some Trump allies cheered the news as yet another way to constrict the mainstream media establishment and elevate explicitly pro-Trump opinion outlets. “Yes to this – keep it going @PressSec,” the first press secretary from Trump’s first term, Sean Spicer, wrote on X to his counterpart Karoline Leavitt. A senior White House official confirmed the plan to CNN but did not add any details. Several correspondents said a shakeup to the seating chart has been expected since the changes would be full of symbolism and would be celebrated by pro-Trump media outlets. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by their employers to speak publicly. “It doesn’t really matter where people sit,” a White House correspondent said. “But it does matter when the White House tries to impact what questions are asked, and how stories are covered, by taking control away from an elected group.” That group is the correspondents’ association, which is governed by a rotating group of journalists who are elected by their peers. The current president of the group, Eugene Daniels, did not respond to a request for comment about the status of the seating chart. The association is said to be considering a range of possible responses. One big unknown is whether the administration intends to remove some big news outlets from assigned seats or merely rearrange who sits where. Even a seemingly minor reordering, though, could change the dynamic during Leavitt’s briefings. Right now, under the association’s seating chart, journalists from the country’s biggest TV networks, newswires, newspapers, and radio networks sit toward the front. A wide range of other well-established news outlets also have assigned seats, with some taking turns in order to fit more than 60 outlets into 49 seats. Every few years the association updates the seating chart to reflect changes across the media landscape. It also assigns “all booths and desks” in the news media’s White House workspace, its website notes. The Trump White House has been sharply critical of the association since Trump retook office in January. Some correspondents believe Trump wants to eliminate the group altogether. In February Trump banned The Associated Press, a foundational part of White House coverage for more than one hundred years, from press conferences and other events. Then Leavitt said the White House would pick the “press pool” reporters who travel with the president and attend small-scale events with him, thereby stripping the association of its historic role organizing the pool. In recent weeks, the White House has invited hyperpartisan pro-Trump websites and relatively low-rated TV networks into the pool. “I love this guy,” Trump gushed on Friday when an employee of the far-right channel One America News offered a compliment disguised as a question. Leavitt has also promoted right-wing podcasters and heterodox writers at her press briefings by turning a seat formerly occupied by a White House aide into a “new media seat.” Longtime correspondents have girded for further changes, especially in light of the Defense Department’s so-called “rotation” program, which removed big news outlets like NPR and CNN from their Pentagon workspaces and replaced them with smaller, ardently pro-Trump media outlets. All of the disruptions have pointed in the same predictable direction: Toward media coverage that supports rather than scrutinizes the administration’s agenda. A Trump-controlled seating chart at briefings would likely add right-wing podcasters and online content creators, though the White House may run into some practical constraints. Many of the pro-Trump personalities who command big online audiences with conservative opinion shows don’t live in Washington, DC, and have little desire to drop in for press briefings. During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when briefing room capacity was reduced for health reasons, CNN’s Kaitlan Collins was told to move out of her first-row seat and switch with a reporter in the back row. Both reporters refused, and the White House backed down. The president of the association at the time, Jonathan Karl, said “there is a decades-long bipartisan tradition of the WHCA determining the seating assignments in the briefing room,” so “we will challenge any effort to pick and choose what outlets are there or the manner in which they are in there.”",,0.23686470091342926
"An errant post on X may have just shaken the stock market, showing how influential — and unreliable — the social media platform can be. Unsourced “headlines” about a potential “90-day pause in tariffs” sent markets into a state of turbulence Monday morning as investors sought any indication of a reprieve from the Trump administration’s new levies. The problem: It wasn’t true. The White House swiftly denied the rumor shortly after it began to circulate online. The false posts may have originated from a real Fox News interview with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett at around 8:30 a.m. ET. Hassett was asked whether President Donald Trump would “consider a 90-day pause in tariffs,” and he replied in part: “The president is (going to) decide what the president is (going to) decide.” According to CNN’s analysis, the first X post to claim Hassett said Trump would consider a 90-day pause in tariffs came at 10:11 a.m. ET from an account called “Hammer Capital” with the handle “yourfavorito,” which has barely 1,000 followers. At about 10:12 a.m., CNN’s Vanessa Yurkevich, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, said that cheers had broken out, as stock indices — which were already recovering from early-morning lows — suddenly surged. “Walter Bloomberg,” an account with a much larger following that uses the handle “DeItaone” copy-and-pasted the original rumor along with a siren emoji at 10:13 a.m. On CNBC, anchors were seemingly baffled, wondering what was causing the turnaround. CNBC anchor David Faber and his network colleagues wondered aloud about the triggering “headline,” searching their computer screens for a wire service alert or any other indication of what could have caused stock market movements. By 10:15 a.m., CNBC anchors were reading the news on air. “I think we can go with this headline, apparently Hassett’s been saying Trump will consider a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except for China,” anchor Carl Quintanilla said. “We’re trying to source that exactly in terms of where that’s coming from,” Faber quickly added. CNBC showed the “headline” on screen less than a minute later. “HASSETT: TRUMP IS CONSIDERING A 90-DAY PAUSE IN TARIFFS FOR ALL COUNTRIES EXPECT CHINA,” the CNBC banner read, as if the news was confirmed. By 10:19, Reuters alerted the supposed comments, citing CNBC. Stocks would later decline as the White House firmly denied the supposed headline. CNBC reporters quickly reported the White House denial, and Reuters updated its stories, later issuing an advisory at 12:28 p.m. withdrawing the original alert along with a statement that the newswire service “regrets its error.” The “Walter Bloomberg” account appears to borrow its name from the Bloomberg financial news service to gain credibility. The account, which has more than 800,000 followers, often posts accurate news flashes from Bloomberg, Reuters and other outlets. “Hammer Capital” also posts headlines, as well as stock market memes. Both that account and “Hammer Capital” do not publicize their real identities. Both have blue checkmarks on X, which used to indicate the account holder’s identity had been verified. But when Musk took over the service formerly known as Twitter, he turned the blue checkmark into a paid service, meaning anyone could pay to appear verified and have their posts boosted on others’ timelines. Once the financial damage was done, “Walter Bloomberg” deleted the post, claiming they first saw it on Reuters, and market participants were left wondering what just happened. “Hammer Capital” said on X they first saw the news on Reuters and CNBC, although Reuters’ flash was at 10:19 a.m., sourced to CNBC. A CNBC spokesperson said in a statement: “As we were chasing the news of the market moves in real-time, we aired unconfirmed information in a banner. Our reporters quickly made a correction on air.” “Hammer Capital” denied making up the headline: “To be as abundantly clear as possible, trading desks started sending out this headline at 10:09. I was regurgitating what the market was reacting to, to my 600 followers. It was an incorrect interpretation of a Fox News interview,” they posted on Monday afternoon. Wherever the original source of the incorrect headline came from, it was amplified by trusted sources in financial news, creating a very expensive lesson in the value of accurate and reliable reporting.

"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then D.W. Pine — Time’s longtime creative director who recently published his thousandth cover — certainly has a lot to say. Pine, who joined the magazine in 1998, has put the world’s most recognizable faces within the storied red border, from Pope Francis and Steve Jobs to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. He’s also the man behind some of the 21st century’s most divisive covers. Under Pine, Time published some covers that drew controversy, such as its May 21, 2012, “Are You Mom Enough?” cover, depicting a 3-year-old boy nursing at his 26-year-old mother’s breast. He also oversaw the magazine’s February 27–March 6, 2017, “Nothing to See Here” cover, showing President Donald Trump behind the Resolute Desk, subsumed in a thunderstorm. And, under Pine, Time ran its August 9, 2010, “Aisha” cover, showing an 18-year-old Afghan woman, whose nose was cut off by the Taliban. Not all covers, which Pine called “journalist poster(s),” are intended to be divisive or elicit provocative responses. The creative director said Time is “successful at times in breaking through the clutter” because its covers don’t always focus on world leaders, often featuring CEOs and celebrities who “aren’t necessarily considered provocative” but who remain “very important.” “Success comes from knowing when to lean into that more ‘provocative’ approach when a topic needs it,” he said. Still, Pine lingered on how Time’s divisive covers deftly convey multiple — and sometimes antithetical — messages. In a market with countless opinion and analysis pieces, the simplicity of an image can sometimes resound more loudly than words. And being placed within the magazine’s red border “really changes someone,” Pine said. The creative director is loath to put any text on the magazine’s cover, instead letting the images speak for themselves. For example, the “Nothing to See Here” cover has a simple duality, Pine said: For Trump supporters, the cover evokes feelings of resilience; for the president’s opponents, it highlights the chaos Trump has ushered into the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Time’s February cover, which placed Elon Musk behind the Resolute Desk, used more overt symbolism since the magazine “didn’t have to say a lot.” Pine stressed that the simple action of placing “the man behind the desk that everyone knows (works) as a visual cue.” “Musk was pulling a lot of the levers, so, sure, we put the two of those together,” Pine said. “All I really wanted was him having a little coffee in his hand because it was like … while he was doing all the work that he and DOGE were doing, he’s just drinking a cup of coffee, it’s like a normal day.” Like many in the media, Pine is mulling how best to distinguish the magazine’s current coverage from its work during the first Trump administration. Trump has already been named Time’s Person of the Year twice, first in 2016 and more recently in 2024. And with 45 appearances, he is the second-most featured person on Time’s cover, behind Richard Nixon, who appeared 55 times. During Trump’s first administration, Pine said every moment felt important enough to put on the cover “because it was so different, and we wanted our readers to understand it.” This time, Pine said the magazine’s covers will adapt to meet a different moment. “Looking ahead, we will continue to cover the president. Some will be provocative,” Pine said. “But I don’t know how much we have to do the same thing we did again, no longer do we have the shock value of stuff that the administration is doing now.” Already, one of Pine’s covers has found itself in the president’s crosshairs. After Pine put Musk behind Trump’s desk, the president took aim at the magazine, asking, “Is Time magazine still in business?” Trump’s response should be taken “with a grain of salt,” Pine said, emphasizing that the president has a history of brushing off criticism he dislikes from reporters and businesses alike with jokes. And Time is used to getting attention from Trump, Pine said, noting the president is “very interested about being on the cover of Time.” “He’s constantly honored when he’s on the cover, but he also has said he only likes about 20% of them,” Pine said. With three years and 10 months left in Trump’s second term, Pine has few doubts that he will soon appear in the red frame more than Nixon, a fact that will likely please the president. Trump has placed himself within its red borders at least once, and in January, the White House shared a fake Time cover — which, ironically, echoed Time’s June 18, 2018, “King Me” cover. Despite Trump’s fascination with Time, his overtaking Nixon — yet more overt symbolism — as the magazine’s most-featured person will likely see covers that court backlash. But the creative director stressed that’s “good for us.” “We want to be able to question authority,” Pine said. “If no one was talking about us, then I think we’d have a problem.”",,0.3078802824020386

The US government is advancing a blockbuster antitrust case, alleging that Mark Zuckerberg’s company illegally built a “social networking monopoly” through years of “anticompetitive conduct.” If the judge sides with the government, Meta could be forced to break itself up by selling Instagram and WhatsApp, and other tech giants could be put on notice. But there is another if: whether President Donald Trump will intervene in some fashion. The agency pursuing the case, the Federal Trade Commission, has historically operated with a remarkable amount of independence, meaning investigators have been insulated from political pressure. Trump has blown up those norms across the executive branch during his second term, however, leading to widespread concerns about favor-trading and corruption. At the same time, Zuckerberg has bent over backward to forge an alliance with Trump through private dinners, public appearances and changes to Meta’s platform. Zuckerberg remarked to Meta employees in January that “we now have an opportunity to have a productive partnership with the United States government” and “we’re going to take that.” Zuckerberg was most recently spotted at the White House on April 2; that same day, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that he was pressing Trump to resolve the FTC case. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, a staunch critic of both men, wrote on X, “Remember how Mark Zuckerberg started cozying up to Trump as Meta donated $1 million to his inauguration? Well now Zuckerberg is trying to cash in — reportedly lobbying Trump to settle the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit against Meta. This is why you always follow the money.” The case against Meta was actually hatched during Trump’s first term. FTC commissioners appointed by Trump, in concert with nearly every state attorney general office, investigated Meta’s past acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and filed a lawsuit in December 2020. The suit was thrown out six months later, but the FTC — by then under the leadership of President Joe Biden’s appointees — came back with a stronger complaint, and the US district judge assigned to the case, Judge James Boasberg, rejected Meta’s bids to dismiss the suit. Boasberg will also be presiding over the trial and ruling for or against Meta,  since there is no jury. His presence adds another layer of intrigue, since he also ruled against Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members. Trump has attacked Boasberg as “a Radical Left Lunatic” and called for his impeachment, even though Boasberg has a nonpartisan record and a sterling reputation in legal circles. Under normal circumstances a president’s personal relationships and opinions would have no bearing on a federal trial. But these are not normal times. Last month Trump fired the two Democrats on the FTC, despite a 1935 Supreme Court ruling that a president cannot do so without cause. The two commissioners, Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, are suing Trump and trying to stay on the commission. “Our laws need to be enforced without fear or favor,” Slaughter told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, warning that “the president has been very clear about directing law enforcement to target his enemies and favor his allies.” So is Zuckerberg a friend or enemy? In a book released last year, Trump accused Zuckerberg of plotting against him in 2020 and said “if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.” Zuckerberg spoke positively about Trump last summer, in the wake of the Butler, Pennsylvania assassination attempt, and met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago after the election. “We had a really nice dinner,” Trump told NBC. “He asked to have dinner. I had dinner with him,” adding, “People like me now, you know?” In January, Zuckerberg instituted a MAGA makeover of Facebook and other platforms, responding in part to Trump’s long-held complaints about “censorship.” He also stood with other tech CEOs at Trump’s inauguration – an extraordinary sight that Trump has brought up many times since. If Trump has warm and fuzzy feelings about Zuckerberg, he has not said so publicly. Trump’s pick to lead the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, recently said the commission’s lawyers are “raring to go” against Meta at trial. But he also said, when asked by The Verge about the prospect of Trump telling to him drop a case like Meta’s, “the president’s head of the executive branch, and I think it’s important for me to obey lawful orders.” “I think that the president recognizes that we’ve got to enforce the laws, so I’d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened,” Ferguson said. Meta, for its part, has made some Trump-friendly arguments in public ahead of the trial start date. “Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” a company spokesperson said. At trial, Meta will also point to what it says “every 17-year-old in the world knows:” that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp “compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.”",,0.2684032917022705
"President Donald Trump has a “hope” for his Federal Communications Commission: that the agency will punish CBS for airing “60 Minutes” reports he doesn’t like. Apparently angered by Sunday night’s “60 Minutes” telecast, Trump wrote on Truth Social about his ongoing legal battle with CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global, which is awaiting FCC approval to merge with Skydance Media. Trump name-checked the man he promoted to chair the FCC, Brendan Carr, whom he called “Highly Respected.” He said hopefully Carr “will impose the maximum fines and punishment, which is substantial, for their unlawful and illegal behavior.” There is no evidence of illegal behavior by CBS. And there is relatively little that Carr can do to impose “punishment,” though the FCC’s delay in approving Paramount’s merger has already created uncertainty at the company. Sunday night’s post is the latest example of Trump encouraging his appointees to apply government pressure against his critics. In recent months, Carr has flaunted his MAGA credentials and launched FCC investigations of several media outlets Trump has derided, including ABC and NBC. Carr was photographed last week wearing a gold pin with a silhouette of Trump’s head. Carr did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about Trump’s Truth Social post. On Sunday night, he depicted “60 Minutes,” the most-watched newsmagazine in the country, in similar terms, writing, “They are not a ‘News Show,’ but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing.” He also wrote that CBS “should lose their license” after the network aired two stories on Sunday - one about Ukraine and another about Greenland. The CBS network is not licensed by the FCC, but local stations owned by CBS are. During the 2024 campaign, Trump said many times that networks he disliked should be stripped of their licenses. He has repeated the call twice since taking office, and CBS has been the target both times. Trump has been both a viewer and a critic of “60 Minutes” for years. He declined the program’s traditional pre-election interview request last fall, and when his opponent Kamala Harris went ahead and appeared on “60,” he saw an opportunity. Trump and his media allies castigated “60 Minutes” for airing one part of Harris’s answer to a question on one day and the other part of her answer on another day. CBS said it had merely edited her answer for time, in accordance with TV news standards, but Trump recast the controversy as a conspiracy, alleging that the network was colluding to help Harris win the election. Trump filed a lawsuit in Texas accusing CBS of violating the state’s Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a consumer protection law. It looked more like a political PR stunt than a legitimate case, and numerous First Amendment attorneys said the suit was frivolous. But after Trump won the election, some Paramount officials began trying to settle the case, over the strenuous objections of “60 Minutes” journalists. Even after CBS handed over the raw transcript and tapes of the interview, which proved that it engaged in normal editing, Carr kept the inquiry open and invited the public to comment. A settlement could look like a payoff to Trump in exchange for merger approval, but The New York Times recently reported that some at Paramount think its “broader corporate interests are not served by fighting a protracted legal battle” with a vengeful president. To date, no settlement has materialized and CBS continues to battle Trump in court. “60 Minutes,” meanwhile, has stayed true to its mission, producing interviews and investigations on Sunday nights. The program has featured stories about the impacts of Trump’s policies “almost every week,” as Trump accurately though angrily noted on Truth Social. He claimed the segments have been “derogatory and defamatory.” Political scientist Brendan Nyhan, co-founder of Bright Line Watch, which monitors threats to American democracy, translated Trump’s Truth Social  post this way: “The president openly calls for his loyalist apparatchik at the FCC to use state power to punish media for critical coverage.” Journalists at CBS have certainly felt the steadily building pressure. While accepting a First Amendment Award at an industry ceremony last month, “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl said she was especially honored to receive the award at a time when “our precious First Amendment feels vulnerable and when my precious 60 Minutes is fighting, quite frankly, for our life.” “I am so proud,” Stahl said, that “60 Minutes” is “standing up and fighting for what is right.”",,0.30560386180877686
"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the witness stand Monday to defend his company against accusations by the Federal Trade Commission that it bought competing social media companies to dominate the market with a monopoly. It was the first of what is expected to be two days of testimony for Zuckerberg, who will seek to explain two of his company’s most important acquisitions, Instagram and WhatsApp. And although Zuckerberg is no stranger to defending his company, the stakes in this case may be higher than ever before. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to break itself apart and spin off WhatsApp and Instagram, which would upend the company’s core digital advertising business and reshape the broader social media ecosystem. Meta relies on the 3.3 billion daily users it claims across its platforms as one of the core selling points of its ad business, which last year alone raked in more than $160 billion in revenue. But the government argued repeatedly in opening statements that Meta’s large user base reflected not simple success, but a lack of choice, saying that “consumers do not have reasonable alternatives” to Meta’s platforms. Lawyers for Meta argued that its platforms have plenty of competition in the social media space and that regulators approved the purchases years ago when they were made. The FTC, however, argued that the acquisitions were intended to prevent Meta from having to compete with nascent, would-be challengers by buying them instead. One email dating to 2011 from Zuckerberg to Facebook executives detailed the company’s reasoning for buying Instagram, relating to the company’s stalled efforts to develop an app called Facebook Camera. “in the time it has taken us to get our act together on this, Instagram has become a large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos, which will increasingly be the future of photos,” Zuckerberg wrote at the time. The company ended up acquiring Instagram in April 2012. Related article
      If Meta loses in antitrust case, it could be forced to break itself up by selling Instagram and WhatsApp The FTC questioned Zuckerberg about the transformation of Facebook from a platform designed to facilitate connections between friends and family to one focused more on showing users interesting third-party content, including the launch of features like the news feed and groups. “It’s the case that over time, the ‘interest’ part of that has gotten built out more than the ‘friend’ part,” Zuckerberg said. “(Users are) connected to a lot more groups and other kinds of things. The ‘friend’ part has gone down quite a bit, but it’s still something we care about.” A large portion of Zuckerberg’s testimony, however, focused on the messaging features built into many of Meta’s platforms, from Facebook to Instagram to WhatsApp, which could be key to how the FTC defines the “market” Meta dominates with its platforms. Zuckerberg said that messaging is “symbiotic” to Facebook’s larger offerings, as it allows users to share content they find with friends, after the FTC attorney asked if Zuckerberg considered messaging to be a “complement” to the platform’s core services. Separately, Zuckerberg conceded that in one 2022 email exchange with Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and Facebook President Tom Alison, he was, as FTC attorney Daniel Matheson put it, “discussing strategies that Meta might employ to ensure there’s a vision for Facebook in light of concern for cultural relevance,” — a reference to Facebook’s declining popularity compared to Instagram and third-party platforms like TikTok. “That’s generally a good summary,” Zuckerberg said. –This story has been updated with additional details and context.",,0.19453758001327515
"Instead of restoring access to The Associated Press newswire, as required by a federal judge, the Trump administration is removing the wire position in the daily press corps rotation altogether. The change appears designed to withstand legal scrutiny while still disadvantaging The AP, which was singled out by President Do﻿nald Trump earlier this year for still using the name Gulf of Mexico. Ultimately the impacts will be felt by newswire customers, including local news outlets that rely on The AP for just-the-facts coverage because they don’t have White House correspondents of their own. The AP said in a statement on Tuesday night: “The administration’s actions continue to disregard the fundamental American freedom to speak without government control or retaliation. This is a grave disservice to the American people.” At issue is the composition of the so-called “press pool,” a small group of journalists who travel with the president and cover events on behalf of the entire press corps. Having a pool rotation is critical because many presidential events, like Oval Office photo ops and Air Force One Q&A’s, take place in small group settings. For decades the pool assignments were determined by the White House Correspondents’ Association, an independent group that represents the press. But in February Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt cut the group out and took control of the pool. Most news outlets that previously took turns in the pool have continued to do so. Leavitt also added a couple of spots, which often (but not always) go to new media outlets that cheerlead for Trump rather than impartially cover him. On Tuesday a White House official formalized pool criteria in a memo, and pointedly omitted a spot for wires, even though wire services like The AP are foundational to White House coverage. Instead, there will now be a second print journalist spot, and wires will be eligible for the two print spots, along with many others. In practice this means The AP, Reuters and Bloomberg will have markedly less access than they did in January, when all three were in the pool every day. The Trump administration instigated a fight with The AP back in February because the wire service did not change its stylebook from “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.” While Trump directed the US government to rename the Gulf, other countries do not recognize the new name. The AP is a global news outlet, so its stories still refer to the Gulf of Mexico while also acknowledging Trump’s decree. The Trump White House started to bar AP journalists from pooled events, and even full-fledged press conferences, citing the Gulf dispute. The AP filed suit in federal court, alleging violations of the First and Fifth Amendments. Last week Judge Trevor McFadden sided with the wire service, writing that “the Constitution forbids viewpoint discrimination, even in a nonpublic forum like the Oval Office.” McFadden said the White House had to “put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP’s use of disfavored terminology.” The judge’s order is reflected in the White House’s updated pool plan, which puts The AP and “similarly situated outlets” like Reuters and Bloomberg on an “equal playing field” by changing the field altogether. Refuting the allegation of “viewpoint discrimination,” Tuesday’s memo said “outlets will be eligible for participation in the Pool, irrespective of the substantive viewpoint expressed by an outlet.” The AP said it was “deeply disappointed” by the move to “restrict the access of all wire services, whose fast and accurate White House coverage informs billions of people every single day, rather than reinstate The Associated Press to the wire pool.” In a statement, Reuters told CNN: “It is essential to democracy that the public have access to independent, impartial and accurate news about their government. Any steps by the U.S. government to limit access to the President threatens that principle, both for the public and the world’s media.” NBC correspondent Kelly O’Donnell, a past president of the correspondents’ association, bemoaned the cutback to wire access in a social media post. “Wire reporters are among the most knowledgeable and dedicated to the White House beat,” she wrote. “They are on duty every day of the year and anywhere in the world needed to cover a president. Their work is a key building block for other media’s work. Wires fill a critical role in the public’s understanding of government and important events.”",,0.2820454239845276
"Among the biggest annoyances of booking an Airbnb are the fees, which can jack up the price of the once affordable alternative to hotels. That’s changing Monday with the platform now displaying the total price on default. All users will now see the full price of a stay, which includes fees and taxes (depending on location), from the get-go. This marks a change from displaying prices based off the nightly rate. The pricing update is part of Airbnb’s commitment to “affordability and transparency,” according to a blog post. Airbnb’s changes come ahead of new US federal regulations about junk fees that are set to go into effect on May 12. The Federal Trade Commission announced new rules late last year banning hotels, ticketing and short-term rental companies from including hidden junk fees in their total. Rather than consumers getting hit with “convenience” or “service” fees for hotel bookings and concert tickets at checkout, the rule will ensure that pricing information is presented transparently before consumers agree to pay, the agency previously announced. The final rule does not limit what sellers can charge for a product or service. Instead, it requires businesses to display the total price, including all additional fees, more prominently than other pricing information. Airbnb began displaying total prices on default in 2019 in several parts of Australia, Canada and Europe. The change rolled out as an option to Canada and the US in 2022 with nearly 17 million guests having used the feature since then, the company said. The company has credited the tool for lowering cleaning fees from hosts. In 2023, Airbnb said that nearly 300,000 listings removed or lowered their fees after it launched the tool, with 40% of active listings eliminating their cleaning fee.",,0.1293206363916397
"America’s two biggest public broadcasters, PBS and NPR, are facing an up-or-down vote over their federal funding for the first time in decades. The Trump administration sees it as a worthwhile cultural fight, casting PBS and NPR as wastes of money that “spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news’” in a statement earlier this week. Station leaders assert that if you tune in, you’ll see that the White House’s portrayal is just plain wrong. “There’s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,” PBS CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement. Without the federal funding, some local stations could be forced off the air, especially in rural areas that are Republican strongholds. In many cases “these are the last locally owned broadcasters in these communities,” Ed Ulman, the CEO of Alaska Public Media, told CNN. So station leaders from Alaska to Maine are rallying public support and lobbying persuadable lawmakers, hoping to fend off the funding threat. “The plan is to remind people of the value proposition,” said Jim Schachter, the CEO of New Hampshire Public Radio. In Schachter’s view, the Trump White House’s attempt to defund NPR and PBS is part of a wider effort to control information and clamp down on independent news coverage. “This is not about the money,” he said. “It’s a minuscule amount of money in the federal budget, though it’s critical to meeting public media’s civic responsibilities. This is about attacking a free press.” At an annual cost to taxpayers of $535 million, or roughly $1.60 per American taxpayer, stations provide free and universal access to educational shows, emergency alerts and a wide array of news and cultural content. Normally the funding is a barely-noticed line item in a gigantic budget bill. In fact, the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month included another $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations. Congress budgets money for public broadcasting two years in advance, so there is nearly $1.1 billion currently allocated for the future – and that’s the amount the Trump administration wants to take back. In a Fox News appearance on Tuesday, Trump’s budget chief Russ Vought confirmed that the administration will send a rescission proposal to Congress at the end of April. Such a proposal would start a 45-day clock for the House and Senate to either vote to cut the funding or ignore the proposal and keep the funding intact. On Fox, Vought said “we’re really excited about” defunding public media, justifying the proposal by claiming PBS and NPR are “putting drag queens in children’s programs, doing documentaries pushing for reparations, and dividing the country on the basis of race.” Republicans made the same charges at a House hearing last month. Public media executives debunked some of the claims; for instance, “the drag queen was actually not on any of our kids shows,” Kerger testified, pointing out that an image was cherry-picked from a single station’s website, and “it was immediately pulled down.” The White House published a list of grievances with public media earlier this week. The list contained news reports about race, sexuality and gender identity along with many allegations of liberal bias. Public media leaders want to reframe the discussion altogether. After all, stations carry a wide array of radio and TV programming, from award-winning newscasts like “Morning Edition” and magazine shows like “Fresh Air” to educational programs like “NOVA” and children’s staples like “Sesame Street.” “Without PBS member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis,” Kerger said in a statement. NPR similarly highlighted its “trusted local and national news, culture, lifesaving emergency alerts, and public safety information.” In the country’s northernmost state, Alaska Public Media operates a radio station in Anchorage and partners with 26 locally owned and operated radio stations, which reach almost every corner of the frontier. Those stations combine to form Alaska’s only statewide news network, which employs nearly 60 journalists, Ulman said. “It is fair to say that many of these stations will close if federal funding is eliminated,” he said. That’s because smaller outlets tend to need more federal support. This year Schachter’s stations in New Hampshire will get $542,000 from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting – less than 6% of his $10 million budget. He said the federal funds “give us a solid starting point” and enable the stations to raise more money from listeners, foundations and other sources. “We fight every day for every dollar,” he said. If the federal dollars dried up, “the knock-on effects would be huge,” Schachter said. That’s because, in addition to the direct support to local stations, the nationwide system provides for satellite connections, content management platforms and even music licenses. With fewer stations able to pay dues and pick up syndicated programming, the system could start to fall apart, executives warn. That’s exactly what longtime conservative critics of PBS and NPR want to see happen. But public media executives are banking on public support, which they hope will translate to Republican votes to protect the funding. In a recent Pew Research poll, only 24% of adults said the government should stop funding public media, while 43% said it should continue and 33% were not sure. “The majority of Americans think it’s worth the $1.60 that they pay in taxes,” Ulman said. In the coming weeks, advocates for the networks will also point to the ongoing cutbacks in for-profit local news coverage to argue in favor of public media. “The commercial marketplace for this kind of civic-minded, community-building, public service journalism is broken,” Schachter said.",,0.30354732275009155
"In April 2023, a few months after Elon Musk purchased Twitter, now called X, the outspoken billionaire went on a bit of a media tour. “Am doing interviews across the political spectrum. BBC’s SF division is ‘left wing’, as evidenced by the questions he asked. Tucker is ‘right wing’. Next week, I will do interviews with moderate & slightly left media,” Musk posted at the time. Two years later, Musk continues to do interviews. But nowadays, Musk sticks with ones that don’t challenge him, often with interviewers who fawn over his accomplishments rather than pushing him to answer important questions about his government work. Since the inauguration and formally joining President Donald Trump’s administration, Musk has made five appearances on Fox News. He’s chatted with Joe Rogan and Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on podcasts where they lavished praise on Musk and never questioned his work in the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has also communicated with friendly political groups abroad, including a congress of Italy’s right-wing Lega party or conferences like the Dubai World Governments Summit. He’s also jumped into live X Spaces conversations, most recently for candidates or causes he supports, like failed Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel. And while he’s occasionally engaged with the White House press pool, Musk has not sat for what could be considered a challenging interview in more than a year. The closest he’s come was with Fox News’ Bret Baier in March, who prodded Musk over calling Sen. Mark Kelly a “traitor”. Musk’s last tough interview occurred in March 2024 with former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who asked about X’s rightward shift, conspiracy theories and Musk’s controversial statements on diversity, transgender people and more. But Musk clearly didn’t like how Lemon challenged him. Lemon, who was supposed to launch a new show on X with the Musk interview, learned shortly afterward that the deal was off. “I’ve interviewed many world leaders, presidents to convicts, and no one has been more sensitive or touchy than Elon Musk,” Lemon told People last year. “He’s not used to being held to account. He’s not used to having to answer to anyone, especially someone like me who doesn’t share his worldview, who doesn’t look like him.” Musk has long had a contentious relationship with the media. In the BBC interview in April 2023, Musk said he has a “love/hate” relationship with the media, though noting he leans more heavily on the “hate” side, saying he relished removing the New York Times’ verification badge on X. He’s been known to slash the communications departments at his businesses, leaving no one to respond to reporters’ inquiries — or in Twitter’s case, to respond with the “poop” emoji. Stories about Musk nearly always note that neither Musk nor his representatives responded to requests for comment. And reporters say it’s difficult to know who is handling Musk’s media — the White House, his personal staff or Musk himself. The White House and a representative for Musk did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment about who handles his interviews. “I don’t have to answer questions from the reporters, Don, the only reason I’m doing this interview is because you’re on the X platform and you asked for it,” Musk told Lemon last year. “Otherwise, I would not do this interview.”",,0.3124829828739166
"US stocks and the dollar tumbled Monday as investors assessed continued tariff uncertainty and the implications of President Donald Trump’s ongoing mission to try and oust Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow fell more than 1,200 points, or 3.1%. The broader S&P 500 fell 3.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.5%. Every company in the Dow and almost every company in the S&P 500 was trading lower as of Monday afternoon. Stock futures had slumped in premarket trading after the three major indexes closed last week in the red. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six foreign currencies, slumped 1% to its lowest level in more than three years. Wall Street has been on edge since Trump on Thursday lashed out at Powell and said on social media that his “termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump lambasted Powell for not cutting interest rates — a complaint he has levied multiple times against the Fed chair. The diatribe came as the European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate and after Powell spoke last week of the potential economic consequences of Trump’s tariff agenda. “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday. “I’m not happy with him.” Related article
      Can Trump fire Jerome Powell? The Supreme Court may soon offer some clues Trump on Monday continued his tirade against Powell, calling him a “major loser” in a social media post pressuring the central bank leader to lower interest rates. Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett on Friday told reporters that the Trump administration “will continue to study” the possibility of removing Powell. Hassett said he wants to look into “new legal analysis” before determining whether Trump can or should terminate Powell — a break from his previous comments stressing the Fed’s independence. While many experts say the president does not in fact have the power to fire the Fed chief due to policy differences, Trump has made clear he’s willing to break with norms and precedent, even in the face of potentially monumental repercussions. Powell on Wednesday said at an event in Chicago said Trump’s tariffs were unlike anything in modern history, with the potential to stoke inflation and drag on economic growth. The stark warning highlights that tariffs could complicate the Fed’s rate-cutting path. Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has long bickered with the Fed chair over interest rates. The Fed’s independence from politics is a hallmark of the central bank, and analysts overwhelmingly expect markets to react negatively to an attempt to fire Powell. Trump’s attack on the Fed’s independence has also raised concerns that investors might lose confidence in the stability of US markets. “President Trump’s renewed criticism of Fed Chair Powell this week is a reminder that trade policy is not the only channel through which the administration’s unconventional approach could undermine the dollar and US asset markets,” said Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, in a Thursday note. Dollar under pressure as confidence wavers When stocks slump, investors usually seek out safe havens like US government bonds and the dollar. Yet investors are selling the dollar while other safe havens, like gold, are soaring. The dollar has broadly weakened this year in a potential sign of waning confidence in the US. Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, said in a Friday note that “recent market action shows a loss of confidence in Trump economic policy,” citing higher Treasury yields and a weaker dollar. Analysts at Macquarie said in a Monday note that “flight from the USD” stems from “concerns over the Fed’s independence” and a lack of trade deal announcements, signaling that negotiations over tariffs might last many months. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.365% on Monday, up from Thursday. US trading was closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. The Fed’s board of governors is scheduled to meet the first week of May to determine its next decision on its benchmark interest rate. About 88% of traders expect the Fed to hold rates steady, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Related article

"The Federal Trade Commission sued ride-hailing giant Uber Monday, alleging “deceptive” billing and cancellation practices in its Uber One subscription service. The FTC alleged the company charged customers for Uber One, a service for fee-free delivery and discounts on rides, without their consent and made it too difficult for them to cancel, despite the company’s “cancel anytime” marketing. “Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,” FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a press release. Uber pushed back against the allegations. Its lawyers that represented the company throughout the FTC investigation, including former FTC chair Tim Muris and former FTC commissioner Christine Wilson, called it a “rushed investigative process” and said the complaint was based on “misunderstandings.” “We are disappointed that the FTC chose to move forward with this action, but are confident that the courts will agree with what we already know: Uber One’s sign-up and cancellation processes are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law. Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can now be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less,” the company said in a statement. The FTC alleged Uber also “failed to deliver promised savings” for the Uber One subscription. Though customers were promised savings of $25 a month, “Uber does not account for the cost of the subscription (up to $9.99/month) when calculating those savings,” the agency said in the press release. Customers were also allegedly enrolled without their consent and were charged before the billing date. The lawsuit used an example of customers who said they signed up for a free trial and were then automatically charged before the free trial even ended. And when it came to cancelling, the FTC said, users were forced to click through up to 23 screens and take 32 actions to cancel. “Some users are told they have to contact customer support to cancel but are given no way to contact them; others claim that Uber charged them for another billing cycle after they requested cancellation and were waiting to hear back from customer support,” the press release said. The suit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California and alleges Uber violated the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act. The suit is one of the first major actions against Big Tech spearheaded by Ferguson’s FTC under the Trump administration. Like many leaders in the industry, Uber and its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi each donated $1 million, respectively, to Trump’s inaugural fund. An antitrust suit brought by the FTC against Meta’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp is also underway, though that lawsuit was filed before Trump took office.",,0.36470112204551697
"Four journalists linked to the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny were sentenced to spend five years and six months in a penal colony on Tuesday, after they were accused of working for a banned organization run by the Kremlin critic, Russian state media TASS has reported. The reporters – Antonina Favorskaya, Sergei Karelin, Konstantin Gabov and Artem Kriger – have been on trial behind closed doors since October on charges, which they deny, of belonging to an “extremist” group established by Navalny in 2011.

      Russian general ousted after criticizing military top brass to return to battle – in charge of notorious unit of ex-convicts Prosecutors claimed the four had produced material for the YouTube channel of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), according to Reuters, which is prohibited under the country’s “foreign agents law.” Amnesty International has warned that the “repressive” legislation is an “attack on freedom of association” in Russia, where Moscow has increasingly attempted to stifle journalists under censorship laws. In February, mourners gathered at Navalny’s graveside in the Russian capital to mark the first anniversary of his death in prison. Dozens of people were detained at memorials, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other rights groups. Over his storied political career, Navalny generated some of the largest anti-government demonstrations in recent years, and unfurled corruption at Russia’s highest seat of power, under the FBK. Navalny died suddenly at the age of 47 on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges he denied. At the time, Russia’s prison service claimed he “felt unwell after a walk.” But Navalny’s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and former US President Joe Biden have long held Russian President Vladimir Putin responsible for his death. Moscow has rebuffed those allegations. Authorities in Russia have since tried to “erase Navalny’s political legacy” through their “extensive arsenal of repressive tools,” according to HRW – which called the arrests on the first anniversary of his death “just the tip of the iceberg in the Kremlin’s continued crackdown on his supporters.”",,0.31209611892700195
"A St Petersburg court has sentenced a 19-year-old woman to nearly three years in a penal colony after she was accused of repeatedly “discrediting” the Russian army, including by gluing a quotation on a statue of a Ukrainian poet. Darya Kozyreva was sentenced to two years and eight months, the Joint Press Service of Courts in St. Petersburg said in statement Friday. Kozyreva was arrested on February 24, 2024, after she glued a verse by Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko onto his monument in St Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, an independent Russian human rights group. The verse from Shevchenko’s My Testament read, “Oh bury me, then rise ye up / And break your heavy chains / And water with the tyrants’ blood / The freedom you have gained,” OVD-Info said. A second case was brought against her in August 2024, following an interview with Radio Free Europe in which she called Russia’s war in Ukraine “monstrous” and “criminal,” OVD-Info said. During one of her hearings, the teenager maintained that she had merely recited a poem, and pasted a quote in Ukrainian, “nothing more,” the court press service said. Related article
      Four Russian journalists linked to late Kremlin critic Navalny sentenced at Moscow court The anti-war activist has had previous run-ins with the law, having been detained in December 2022 while still at high school for writing, “Murderers, you bombed it. Judases,” on an installation dedicated to the twinning of the Russian city of St Petersburg and Ukraine’s Mariupol, the rights group said. She was then fined for “discreditation” a year later and expelled from university for a post she made on a Russian social media platform discussing the “imperialist nature of the war,” according to Memorial, one of the country’s most respected human rights organizations. Describing Kozyreva as a political prisoner, Memorial condemned the charges against her as “absurd” in a statement last year, saying they were aimed at suppressing dissent. Prosecutors had been seeking a six-year sentence for Kozyreva, Russian independent media channel, SOTA Vision, reported from inside the courtroom. Video footage by Reuters showed Kozyreva smiling and waving to supporters as she left the court. Kozyreva’s lawyer told Reuters they would likely appeal. The verdict was condemned by Amnesty International’s Russia Director Natalia Zviagina as “another chilling reminder of how far the Russian authorities will go to silence peaceful opposition to their war in Ukraine.” “Daria Kozyreva is being punished for quoting a classic of 19th-century Ukrainian poetry, for speaking out against an unjust war and for refusing to stay silent. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of Daria Kozyreva and everyone imprisoned under ‘war censorship laws,’” Zviagina said in a statement. Russia has a history of attempting to stifle anti-war dissent among its younger generation. Last year, CNN reported that at least 35 minors have faced politically motivated criminal charges in Russia since 2009, according to OVD-Info. Of those, 23 cases have been initiated since Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Currently, more than 1,500 people are imprisoned on political grounds in Russia, according to a tally by OVD-Info, with Moscow’s crackdown on dissent escalating since the war began. Between then and December 2024, at least 20,070 people were detained for anti-war views, and there were 9,369 cases of “discrediting the army,” relating to actions including social media posts or wearing clothes with Ukrainian flag symbols, according to OVD-Info.",,0.3408922553062439
"Ibragim Ibragimov’s latest victory over Kenny Mokhonoana kept alive his unbeaten start to professional MMA fighting and his status as one of the most exciting prospects in the sport. But in the hours after the win, the 20-year-old was quick to praise all the help he received in his preparations. Ibragimov posted a photo on his Instagram of his training staff in Dubai, a group which included two of the greatest MMA fighters ever in Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev. A post shared by Ibragim Ibragimov (@ibragim) Perhaps it is no surprise that Ibragimov has had such success – he is 9-0 in his blossoming career with his sights set on the top – when he has such legends in his corner. Ibragimov is the latest in the production line of mixed martial arts talent to come out of Dagestan, Russia, with Nurmagomedov and Makhachev acting as figureheads and role models for the new generation. For a region with a population of just over three million – smaller than Los Angeles – it has become renowned for churning out top-level fighting talent, famous for their wrestling abilities and never-say-die attitude. Ibragimov – who fights in the Professional Fighters League (PFL) – is part of the most recent generation of Dagestani fighters who are taking over the sport, and he says that for he and compatriots, fighting is a way of life, not just a profession. “In Dagestan, guys really want to be fighters. In the whole of Europe, there’s not many guys who really want to be fighters,” Ibragimov told CNN Sports. “They just pretended like they are fighters. They want to be like fighters. They want to be like someone. “But in Dagestan, there’s so many guys that really want to be fighters. Not all (European fighters). I’m not speaking for all of them, but I’d say like 30% or 50% of the guys, they don’t really want to be there. They just go in there for a hype and stuff like that, for Instagram.” ‘Despair from a young age’ While fighting might be a walk of life for some, it’s more than that for many Dagestanis. Michael Lyubimov, a famed MMA coach who has worked with many Dagestani fighters including Nurmagomedov, explained that when he often first encounters athletes from the Russian republic upon their arrival in the US, they are already vastly experienced. Lyubimov – who is general manager of the Jackson Wink MMA Academy in New Mexico, renowned for its production of MMA talent – says that many young Russians take up fighting out of “despair from a young age.” “Back where they come from, there’s absolutely nothing. A lot of these guys that come here, I mean, they fought since they’re like six years of age,” Lyubimov – who was born in Moscow before moving to the US as a youngster – told CNN. “By the time they get to the UFC or obtaining these big promotions or come to America, they have over 200 fights and stuff.” He added: “There’s no other option. There are cauliflower ears everywhere. It’s just who they are. It’s in the culture, engraved in them.” Lyubimov also highlights the faith of the fighters from the region as a reason for their success, with many of them practicing Muslims. That means they often don’t drink or party and choose instead to focus on their craft. The combination of those factors breeds a relentlessness in Dagestani fighters, according to Lyubimov. He recounts an athlete once telling him that he “will die in there before anything happens.” Many fighters from the region will put their bodies through significant hardship to sign with big-money promotions, often waiting until they’ve inked deals before undergoing the necessary treatment to heal their ailments. Lyubimov highlights to CNN Sports the journey of Ismail Israilov, from neighboring Chechnya, who recently won a fight after dislocating his shoulder in the first round. Before coming to the US, Israilov had been in a truck accident in which he almost lost his hand and, at the age of 24, has over 200 street fights to his name. When Lyubimov asked Israilov what his upbringing was like back in Russia, the Chechen detailed how he came to have the resilience he now displays in the octagon. “‘My whole life was like, you have a piece of bread in your backpack, and you drive for like an hour and a half to wrestling practice, and sometimes you can’t make it because it’s so far away or whatever, so we’d just fight on the street and practice on the pavement,’” Lyubimov recounts Israilov saying.

      From construction worker to UFC champion: Merab Dvalishvili’s humble journey “‘We live in the middle of nowhere in the mountains. You look one way and there’s nothing there, you look the other way and there’s nothing there. All we have left is to fight.’” During his time as part of Nurmagomedov’s coaching team, Lyubimov spent plenty of hours in the gym with the former UFC great, in both the US and his native Dagestan. Compared to the current commercial gyms he works in now, the centers in Dagestan are vastly different environments with their hyper-focus on discipline, says Lyubimov. “In Dagestan, gyms are government funded or recreational where people can come in. A lot of it is somewhat free, to a certain extent, until, of course, they make it to the big level where they start paying coaches and they’re like at a higher level, professional level,” he said. “But at the beginning level, most of it is free. That’s why if you see Khabib when he walks into the room, or when Abdulmanap (Nurmagomedov’s father) would walk in into the room, all the fighters get up, they line up, they bow down, they’re quiet, they don’t talk, they’re always on time, they don’t talk back to elders, they have absolute major respect. “If you show disrespect to an elderly person or coach or whoever, your peers will put you in place and you can literally get slapped like by a coach and you will be quiet about it and you stand there and take the criticism and them yelling at you if you’re being a dumbass.” Role models That rugged upbringing builds character and toughness. For Lyubimov, this sets the perfect platform from which to build a career. When Lyubimov starts working with Dagestani fighters, it is often a case of refining their skills rather than adding more to their repertoire. “Obviously America is Mecca for making the name for yourself, right?” he explains. “The lights are much brighter when they hit the American promotions. So, it’s just about teaching the composure, keeping emotions under check, and refining the skills. “It’s teaching them how to adapt and how to just refine their skills in general, just making better fighters, understand the game better, understand the rules better, understand what to expect better, get them to deal with medicals, with fight preparations, with weight cutting. The diet, the weight cuts, everything because they do it one way over there. They come here, then they have to kind of relearn, or learn new things.” The golden example of having to adjust to the American system was Nurmagomedov, who arrived in the US as a little-known prospect and blossomed into the biggest name in the sport. His rise to prominence in the UFC was the jumping-off point for Dagestani dominance across the Western MMA scene. Between his grappling skills, undefeated record and his customary wearing of Dagestan’s traditional papakha headpiece in the ring, Nurmagomedov became the hottest topic in the UFC despite not getting involved in the war of words which often previews fights or helps build rivalries between competitors. His popularity grew to a previously unseen level through his rivalry with Conor McGregor, and then he retired a few years later. Lyubimov, who helped train Nurmagomedov during his heyday, said that the fighter understood that he needed to engage in sparring matches to continue to build his profile. Since retiring in 2020, Nurmagomedov has transitioned into a mentor for the next generation of Dagestani fighters. He has had a hands-on effect on the burgeoning career of Makhachev, who is the No. 1 ranked pound-for-pound fighter at the moment and the current UFC lightweight world champion. Elsewhere in the UFC, another Dagestani – Magomed Ankalaev – became UFC light heavyweight champion in March, while there are other world champions in MMA competitions around the world from the Russian region. Before his most recent fight in January, Ibragimov trained with Nurmagomedov and Makhachev in Dubai and says the experience in the gym with two of MMA’s luminaries and his Dagestani “brothers” was formative for his burgeoning career. “When you train in Khabib’s gym, and then, especially when he’s in there controlling you, there’s no limits,” he told CNN Sports. “It’s like sometimes he doesn’t even set the timer for training. And then we just train non-stop. We just roll nonstop, until he says stop.” Ibragimov explained that a young Dagestani’s MMA journey is made that much easier because the previous generation has already walked that path and is around to give advice where needed. “They already showed us the road that we have to follow,” he said. Ibragimov – who moved to Manchester, England, as a youngster and has siblings who are part of the Manchester United academy – has a long journey ahead of him in his MMA career. But in Nurmagomedov, Makhachev and other Dagestani fighters, he’s got the perfect role models showing him the way to the top.",,0.3839910328388214
"Russia’s Supreme Court on Thursday lifted a ban on Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban, a group that was designated as a terrorist organization more than two decades ago. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as US and NATO troops were in the final weeks of withdrawing from the country after two decades of war. The Russian court’s move was a diplomatic victory for the Taliban, who were put on Moscow’s list of terrorist organizations in 2003, making any contact with them punishable under Russian law. At the same time, Taliban delegations have attended various forums hosted by Russia as Moscow has sought to position itself as a regional power broker. The court’s ruling on a request by the Prosecutor General’s Office followed last year’s adoption of a law stipulating that the official designation as a terrorist organization could be suspended by a court. The former Soviet Union fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Moscow withdrawing its troops in 1989. Russian officials have recently been emphasizing the need to engage with the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan. In recent years, the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have removed the Taliban from their lists of terrorist groups. The Taliban initially promised a more moderate rule than during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, but started to enforce restrictions on women and girls soon after the 2021 takeover. Women are barred from most jobs and public places, including parks, baths and gyms, while girls are banned from education beyond sixth grade. Such measures have isolated the Taliban on the world stage, although their government has established diplomatic ties with countries including China and the United Arab Emirates. The UN this year renewed its call for the Taliban to lift the bans. The group’s decrees limiting the participation of girls and women have affected foreign aid to the country. The Taliban also have brought back their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, including public executions. Some Taliban want greater engagement with the international community and want to scrap harsher policies to attract more outside support. In recent months, there has been increased engagement between the Taliban and the US under President Donald Trump, mostly because of prisoner exchanges and releases. Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with Crisis Group’s Asia Program, said the Taliban’s listing as a terrorist group was a legal impairment for trade and political ties with Kabul and its lifting reflected Moscow’s desire to improve relations. “However, beyond making it easier for individuals and businesses to engage with Afghanistan, I am not sure what other major benefit this will have,” he said. South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said the Russian move was not ground-breaking because many countries had never formally designated the Taliban as a terrorist organization. At the same time, he called the decision a “win-win” for bilateral relations. For Russia, he said it would serve as a confidence-building measure helping pave the way for more engagement and enabling Moscow to better protect its interests in Afghanistan, particularly concerns about anti-Russia terror groups like Islamic State-Khorasan. “Meanwhile, for the Taliban, the court decision is a legitimacy-boosting outcome they can leverage to point to international acceptance of their rule,” Kugelman observed.",,0.21266457438468933
"Pope Francis gave the traditional Easter blessing earlier today, appearing from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica in front of delighted crowds in what marks his highest-profile appearance since being discharged from the hospital after falling ill with double pneumonia. The 88-year-old pontiff has not led the main Holy Week and Easter services but has made brief appearances, including spending 30 minutes at a prison in Rome on Thursday and a visit to St. Peter’s Basilica on Saturday evening. Here’s what else you need to know to Start Your Week Smart.  Sunday spotlight Tuesday marks 55 years since millions of Americans from coast to coast came together to celebrate the first Earth Day. Over the subsequent decades, Earth Day has spread around the globe as more and more countries call for environmental regulations to protect the planet’s air, water, forests and wildlife from industrial pollution and greenhouse gases that are harming our climate. But as other industrialized nations make strides to reduce emissions, the US appears to be shifting into reverse. On the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump signed actions to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, an international treaty in which nearly 200 countries agreed to work together to limit global warming. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency have been slashing federal workers and eviscerating weather and climate research programs — all at a time when the stakes couldn’t be higher for the planet and humanity’s ability to adapt to the changing climate and the increasing cost of climate-related disasters. 1️⃣ Rising temperatures: The Earth just recorded its 10 hottest years over the last decade. And last year was confirmed to be the hottest since records began 175 years ago, beating the previous record set in 2023. While scientists say that doesn’t mean that we’ve permanently crossed global limits set under the Paris Agreement, we are getting close. 2️⃣ Not a pretty picture: A striking new visualization made by a climate scientist shows the increase in daily global temperatures between 1940 and the end of 2024 compared to the period before humans began burning huge amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. As the data spirals outwards, it becomes redder and redder as global temperatures ramp up. 3️⃣ Stronger hurricanes: Record-breaking ocean temperatures fueled by planet-warming pollution have turbocharged dozens of Atlantic hurricanes in recent years, making them more potent and dangerous. And this year’s upcoming hurricane season, which spans from June through November, is shaping up to be another busy one. 4️⃣ Predictions of extreme weather events may get worse: Coordinated twice-daily weather balloon launches make up the backbone of weather forecasts across the globe. But due to staffing shortages brought on by the Trump administration, the National Weather Service has cut weather balloon launches at eight sites across the US. Here’s what that could mean for critical weather reports, particularly during severe weather events, like tornadoes, ice storms and hurricanes. 5️⃣ Hope springs eternal: Despite the increasing din of climate-related alarm bells, there are reasons to be hopeful. CNN’s chief Climate correspondent Bill Weir has spent years looking at our warming planet and searching for the most promising solutions and most resilient communities. This is what he found.

"Prosecutors in Berlin on Wednesday charged a doctor suspected of administering lethal amounts of various medications to palliative patients under his care with 15 counts of murder. Prosecutors are also seeking a lifelong professional ban for the 40-year-old suspect, detained since August 2024, who had been active in several German states. The suspect, not officially named in line with German privacy laws, has not admitted the charges, said prosecutors. He was initially suspected of being involved in four deaths last year, which prosecutors said he had tried to cover up by setting fire to the victims’ apartments. However, ongoing investigations have turned up more suspected deaths, dating back to 2021, and that number could rise even further. An investigative team set up specifically for the case is evaluating his patient records and more exhumations are planned.

"Arsenal and Inter Milan progressed to the Champions League semifinals after an action-packed night of soccer on Wednesday. Arsenal overcame the challenge of Real Madrid while Inter beat Bayern Munich to seal the club’s spots in the next round of the tournament. The semifinal fixtures are now confirmed, with PSG to face the Londoners and Barcelona taking on the Italian giants with a coveted spot in the final up for grabs. Arsenal and PSG seek their first-ever Champions League trophy, with the Gunners buoyed by knocking out the reigning Champions League winners. Arsenal defeat 15-time Champions League winners Arsenal took a three-goal lead to the Santiago Bernabéu ahead of the second leg, but Real Madrid has become known for producing miracles in the Champions League. The traveling side would have been wary of Madrid’s storied success in the competition, knowing an early goal for either team would be crucial. Arsenal was gifted with an early chance after being awarded a penalty just 10 minutes into the match. Bukayo Saka stepped up for the Gunners but saw his dinked spot kick saved by Thibaut Courtois. Less than 15 minutes later, it looked as if Arsenal would be punished for the wasted opportunity. Real Madrid was given a penalty when star striker Kylian Mbappé fell to the floor in the Arsenal box. The decision, however, was overturned following a lengthy VAR check. The game remained cagey with neither side looking to give up an inch, until in the 65th minute, when Saka made amends for his earlier miss. After a flowing move from Mikel Arteta’s side, Saka was played through one-on-one by makeshift striker Mikel Merino. Arsenal’s star man remained composed and sat down Courtois in the Madrid goal with a delicately executed chip. All involved with Arsenal would have breathed a huge sigh of relief after going 4-0 up on aggregate, but this sense of relief was short-lived. Real Madrid star Vinícius Júnior leveled the score on the night just minutes after the Arsenal opener. The Brazilian was gifted the chance to score into an empty net after a mistake from Arsenal defender William Saliba. It proved to be too little, too late, however, and to rub salt in the Real Madrid wounds, Gabriel Martinelli raced through on goal in added time and confidently finished past Courtois. Arsenal ended up winning 2-1 on the night and 5-1 across the two legs to seal its spot in the Champions League semifinal – its first since 2009 – where it faces PSG. Inter Milan holds on to beat Bayern Munich Elsewhere, Inter Milan managed to seal a tight 4-3 aggregate win against Bayern Munich. The Italian side was leading 2-1 after the first leg and would have felt confident about holding on to its lead at home. Bayern Munich, however, was keen to upset the odds and leveled the aggregate score when Harry Kane expertly scored from a tight angle early in the second half. But Inter Milan bounced back, and quickly. Lautaro Martínez scored for Inter just six minutes after Kane’s opener before Benjamin Pavard gave the home side the lead on the night just three minutes after Martínez’s equalizer. Eric Dier gave Bayern Munich renewed hope when he scored with 15 minutes left in the tie, but the Italian side was able to hold on to its slender lead. A semifinal tie against Barcelona now waits for Inter Milan. Barcelona reached the semifinals of the Champions League for the first time in six years, despite being outplayed and comfortably beaten 3-1 by Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. Hansi Flick’s side is looking to win a first Champions League title in 10 years – back when Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar famously led the team’s attack.

"Police in Germany have raided the home of a teenage boy suspected of making and storing ricin, a highly toxic and deadly biological warfare agent. The 16-year-old is accused of producing “several vials” containing a mixture of ricin and aconitine, another potent plant toxin, in a makeshift laboratory in the attic of his family home in Zeithain, a municipality in the eastern state of Saxony, police said. The Saxony State Criminal Police Office has launched an investigation in conjunction with the Dresden Public Prosecutor’s Office into the possible violation of Germany’s Weapons of War Act, which regulates the production and trade of materials considered weapons of war. Officers have been searching the suspect’s home since the early hours of Thursday morning, according to the Saxony police statement. They are seeking to “secure all toxic substances and other evidence,” the statement said. Investigators have so far not uncovered any evidence regarding the suspect’s intentions for the toxic substance, police said. An arrest warrant has not been issued. Based on the current status of the investigation, there are no grounds for detention under Germany’s Code of Criminal procedure, particularly considering the Juvenile Justice Act, the statement said. Ricin is a natural, highly toxic compound that is a byproduct of processing castor beans. It is potentially lethal when inhaled, ingested or injected. Less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours due to the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems.

"World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka was so sure that the umpire had made an incorrect call during her Stuttgart Open quarterfinal victory over Elise Mertens that she used a mobile phone to photograph the mark left by the ball. Tied at three games each in the first set but down two break points, Sabalenka’s volley was called out. The Belarusian challenged the decision and umpire Miriam Bley went over to check the mark, but confirmed the original call. Related article
      Aryna Sabalenka defeats home favorite Zheng Qinwen to win third straight Wuhan Open title During the changeover, an apparently bemused Sabalenka crossed the court to check the mark, before urging Bley to check it again. When the umpire refused, the three-time Grand Slam singles winner collected a phone from a member of her team and took a photograph of the mark in the clay, to a mixture of cheers and whistles from the crowd. She promptly received a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct. Sabalenka said in her on-court interview afterward that she thought the umpire was irritated by the picture she took. “When I gave her a handshake there was a very interesting look and a very strong handshake, never had it before,” Sabalenka said. Asked whether she squeezed back, the 26-year-old replied: “No, it’s okay. Why would I play this game with someone like her?” Seemingly unaffected by the controversy, Sabalenka broke back instantly and went on to win the match 6-4, 6-1. The quarterfinal against Mertens, her former doubles partner, was Sabalenka’s first match at this year’s tournament after she got a bye through the first round and a walkover in the second. She will face No. 5 Jasmine Paolini in the semifinal on Sunday after the Italian beat No. 4 Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-3. Elsewhere at the Stuttgart Open, Jelena Ostapenko beat world No. 2 Iga Świątek 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 to extend her remarkable record over the Polish player to six wins and no losses. “I have so much respect to her and her team and everything she is doing for tennis,” said the world No. 24. “But every time I step on the court with her it’s another battle. I’m ready for it. Even if I don’t feel great on the day, I will just fight and leave it all on the court.”",,0.3401128351688385
"At a town hall in South Carolina, veteran congressman Jim Clyburn emphasized that Democrats are limited in what they can do in the minority in Congress, urging attendees to speak out and vote to help tip the scales and the balance of power. The friendly crowd peppered long-serving Democratic lawmaker with questions about taxes, Social Security, tariffs and the Constitution – with concerns about how the Trump administration is handling all of those issues and more. “It’s obvious the Trump administration has no use for the Constitution whatsoever,” one attendee said, asking Clyburn about the Trump administration’s immigration efforts and suggesting he feared US-born citizens could be next. “What can Congress do to put a stop to this nonsense coming out of the White House?” Clyburn gave a lengthy response, including reading out the 14th Amendment and emphasizing the importance of hosting congressional town halls and speaking to voters across the country. The congressman then asked the crowd to pray that the US “will not allow itself to go the way of Germany in the 1930s.” “All we can do is share with you what we’re doing and ask for your prayers that this country will not allow itself to go the way of Germany in the 1930s when people stood by,” he said. After reading out the famous “First They Came” quote from German Lutheran pastor Martin Niemöller, the congressman said, “we remember what happened to the Jews,” referencing the six million Jewish people who were murdered in the Holocaust by Hitler’s Nazi regime during World War II. “So, we’re going to have to speak out. We’ve got to break our silence. And this is not about Democrats and Republicans. My parents were Republicans. My mother and father were Republicans. I love them. I don’t hate Republicans. I do hate liars,” he said prompting cheers from the crowd. Asked by CNN after the town hall if he is truly afraid the country is sliding into autocracy, Clyburn said, “I absolutely am. There’s no question about that.” The congressman reflected on his history of civil rights activism and his fears over the current political climate. “I told the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, I think it was three weeks ago, I said to them, ‘when I was sitting in the Orangeburg County jail, the Richland County jail back in the sixties, I never feared.” “I knew that I would be found guilty, I knew that I would get a sentence. But I also knew that if this gets to the US Supreme Court, I would be exonerated. Not today, not today. This Supreme Court, I don’t think would exonerate me for wanting to get out off the back of the bus. For wanting to be able to walk into a Five and Dime store and spend my money at a lunch counter.” “These kinds of things, those indignities we suffered back in the Sixties I think we would be found guilty today for standing up against them. And I think the Supreme Court, this Supreme Court would sustain that.” A number of Democratic lawmakers have faced contentious exchanges and criticism that their party and its leaders are not doing enough to stand up to President Trump at recent town halls. But the town hall with Clyburn did not feature disruptions or an unruly crowd. The congressman said at the outset of the event that he would not talk over anyone or yell and hoped that everyone would display good manners. CNN’s Sylvie Kirsch contributed.",,0.2319829761981964
"European and Ukrainian officials met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff in Paris on Thursday after weeks of being sidelined in US President Donald Trump’s push to end the war in Ukraine through direct talks with Moscow. Ukrainian and US officials had an “excellent exchange” with their British, French and German counterparts, according to a source at France’s Elysée Palace, with the meetings providing “a very strong strategic opportunity.” A US-authored outline of a peace plan had received an “encouraging reception” at the talks, according to a State Department readout, which did not give details on the outline. Following the talks, Rubio spoke with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and conveyed the same outline, the readout said. “President Trump and the United States want this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace,” it said. Ukraine and the three US allies stressed their shared support for Trump’s efforts to bring about a rapid end to the war, according to the Elysée source. For Ukraine’s European allies, the summit offered a chance to gauge the Trump administration’s thinking on the war in Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies have been alarmed by Trump’s and Witkoff’s parroting of Kremlin talking points, and may have viewed the talks as a chance to disrupt and dislodge those perceptions. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky – who was not at the Paris talks – repeated criticism of Witkoff on Thursday, accusing him of “spreading Russian narratives,” according to Reuters. More meetings will take place next week in London in the same format, the source added. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce would not say whether Rubio would attend the discussions. French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday’s talks marked “a day of diplomatic mobilisation,” in a post on social media. “Today, we engaged in a positive and constructive discussion on how to achieve both a ceasefire and a comprehensive, lasting peace,” Macron said. Elsewhere, Trump told reporters Thursday that the United States would be “hearing” from Moscow “this week” on the US proposal for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. “We’re going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly, actually, and we’ll see. But we want it to stop. We want the death and the killing to stop,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office. Trump added that while he is not a “big fan” of Zelensky, he does not hold the Ukrainian leader responsible for the war. ﻿“I don’t hold Zelensky responsible, but I’m not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. That was a war that would have never started if I were president,” Trump told reporters. If Trump’s pledge to end the war in a day was far-fetched, the hope to secure a full truce by Easter – this weekend – also looks likely to fail. Russia has ramped up its strikes on Ukraine in recent weeks, despite Washington’s overtures to Moscow. After meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin for a third time last week, Witkoff told Fox News that any peace deal in Ukraine will center on the “so-called five territories,” referring to Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Russia annexed in 2014, and the four mainland Ukrainian regions Russia has occupied since its full-scale invasion in 2022, having previously suggested Ukraine may have to cede them under a truce. Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, told CNN Tuesday that Witkoff “with all due respect… may be inadvertently trying to push pro-Russian narratives.” A ‘deal’ proves elusive Despite its ambitious pledges, the Trump administration has struggled to broker a lasting peace deal between the warring countries, and has been accused of using mostly sticks in its dealing with Ukraine while saving its carrots for Russia. After the White House briefly cut weapons supplies and intelligence sharing to Ukraine in March, Kyiv swiftly agreed to the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Related article
      Trump calls Sumy missile strike a ‘mistake.’ But Russia’s war seems to be raging on exactly to Putin’s plan Following separate talks with Russian and Ukrainian officials later that month, the White House said both had agreed to the ceasefire on energy infrastructure and in the Black Sea – only for the Kremlin to announce it would only implement the agreement when sanctions imposed on its banks and exports are lifted. The Center for Countering Disinformation, a Ukrainian think-tank, has pointed out that the supposed truce has done little to constrain Russia’s aggression. In the 22 days after the truce, the Russian army killed nearly 2.5 times more Ukrainians than during the same period before it was announced, the center said in an update Tuesday. In a sign of growing irritation with Moscow, Trump last week said that “Russia has to get moving,” but provided no deadlines or ultimatum if it did not. While the Paris summit was underway, Kirill Dmitriev, a top Russian negotiator, claimed that many countries are trying to “disrupt” Russia’s dialogue with the US. He said Putin’s latest meeting with Witkoff was “extremely productive,” but that the dialogue was taking place in “very difficult conditions – constant attacks, constant disinformation.” This story has been updated with additional information.

"Editor’s Note: This story contains minor spoilers for the upcoming season of “Emily in Paris.” “Emily in Paris” looks to be saying au revoir – or ciao – to one cast member that has been part of the Netflix series since the beginning. Camille Razat, who plays Emily’s (Lily Collins) frenemy of the same first name, does not appear to be returning for Season 5, according to a cast announcement published on Netflix’s Tudum on Thursday. Razat has been a series regular for the past four seasons playing Gabriel’s (Lucas Bravo) on-again-off-again romantic partner. CNN reached out to a representative for Netflix for comment on Razat’s future with the franchise, as well as representatives for Razat. Among the cast members who are returning are Collins, Bravo, Ashley Park, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu and Lucien Laviscount. Emily’s new Italian love interest Marcello, played by Eugenio Franceschini, will also be back. Bravo’s return to the series comes after the actor previously spoke out about his displeasure with his character’s arc, telling IndieWire in an interview last year that he was questioning if he wanted “to be part of Season 5.” Netflix also announced on Thursday that the series will start production on Season 5 in May, filming in Rome before heading back to Paris later this summer. Season 4 ended with Emily being tasked with opening up a Roman branch of Agence Grateau. Of course, her love interest Marcello will be part of that story, further complicating her already complex romantic relationship with Gabriel as they work toward his restaurant earning a Michelin star. “Marcello is a whole other adventure that we want for Emily because we ultimately want Emily to be able to have a better work/life balance,” star Collins told Tudum. “We want to have Emily be able to smile without condition. We want to see her beyond her vacay mode. And he comes at that perfect time.” A release date for Season 5 has not yet been announced.",,0.3268667757511139
"Throughout its 46-year history, architecture’s most prestigious prize has often been won by icon-builders: the apparent lone geniuses who imprint their visions, signature-like, on the world. It is emblematic of the industry’s shifting priorities that this year’s Pritzker Prize, often dubbed the “Nobel of architecture,” has gone to a man who actively avoids having a recognizable style. Liu Jiakun, unveiled as 2025’s laureate on Tuesday, has spent much of his four-decade career designing understated academic buildings, museums and public spaces in his home city of Chengdu (and nearby Chongqing), in China’s southwest. His hyper-local and self-admittedly “low-tech” techniques have come at the expense of a distinctive aesthetic. In China’s era of architectural excess, Liu has instead quietly thrived by letting each site — and the history, nature and craft traditions surrounding it — shape his designs, not vice versa. Whether repurposing earthquake debris or creating voids in which native wild flora can flourish, methodology matters more than form. In its citation, the Pritzker Prize jury praised Liu for precisely that: having “a strategy instead of a style.” Explaining his approach to CNN ahead of the announcement, the 68-year-old architect (who admitted to being “a little surprised” by the accolade) said he tried to act “like water.” “I try my best to penetrate and understand the place … then, when the time is right, it will solidify, and the idea of ​​the building will appear,” he said on a video call from Chengdu, adding: “A fixed style is a double-edged sword. It can make others remember you quickly, but it also binds you and makes you lose a certain freedom.” Related article
      These buildings would have transformed skylines, but they were never built Liu’s firm, Jiakun Architects, has completed over 30 projects — all in China — in almost as many years. The architect has often turned to his country’s history for inspiration. Traditional pavilions informed the flat rooftop eaves of his Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick in Suzhou; the wraparound balconies of the Shanghai campus he designed for Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis evoke a tiered pagoda. But these nods to the past are never for history’s sake alone, Liu said. “I focus on the themes that tradition focuses on, rather than the forms that tradition presents,” he explained. In other words, elements of traditional architecture must be reinterpreted for functional, modern use, not used as tributes to a bygone time. Indeed, China’s cities are inundated with examples of the opposite, whereby curved roofs are added to otherwise characterless structures in the pursuit of an ill-defined “Chinese-ness.” “Traditional forms … are the results of the culture, technology and people’s philosophy of survival at that time,” Liu explained. “If we focus on the superficial results, we will stop at that time. But if we focus on the themes that tradition has always focused on, but use current technology and methods, then there’s a continuation of tradition.” China’s new dawn Born in 1956, three years before China’s (and arguably the world’s) most devastating famine, Liu’s childhood revolved around the Chengdu hospital where his mother worked. He demonstrated an early aptitude for art and literature, though, like many of his generation, his teenage years were interrupted by the Cultural Revolution when he was sent to the countryside as part of Mao Zedong’s “educated youth” program. Liu’s career has, however, neatly coincided with the post-Mao period — one that has seen architecture freed from state control and socialist ideals. He accepted a place at Chongqing’s Institute of Architecture and Engineering in 1978, two years after the former Chinese Communist Party leader’s death, and graduated amid the reform-era policies that opened China’s centrally planned economy to free-market forces. This period heralded huge changes for architecture. Key foreign texts and journals from the field entered the country and became more widely available to students and academics. Government-controlled design institutes, like the one Liu worked at in his early career, were finally permitted to charge fees, having previously only served the state. Yet, in the fast-moving atmosphere of 1980s China, Liu still felt architecture “lagged behind.” “When I graduated, it seemed that architects had nothing to do,” he said. “The economy had not developed, and ideas had not become active.” Related article
      Why turning cities into ‘sponges’ could help fight flooding By the early 1990s, Liu — who was, at the time, also pursuing writing — considered quitting the profession altogether. He changed his mind after seeing an exhibition by a former classmate, the architect Tang Hua, that he says inspired him to escape the shadow cast by their sector’s state-controlled past. He established Jiakun Architects, one of the country’s very first private practices, in 1999. The firm’s early projects laid a blueprint for understanding Liu’s ethos. His Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum, which opened in Chengdu in 2002, sits serenely in a bamboo forest, its rough concrete and gray shale existing in harmony with the stone artifacts housed within. The recesses and overhangs of his rust-colored Department of Sculpture building, completed for the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute in Chongqing two years later, are themselves acts of sculpture. At the Museum of Clocks, also in Chengdu, textural red brickwork alludes more to the area’s humble past than a gleaming future. As architecture in China became increasingly bold and bombastic in the 2010s (a trend that eventually led the country’s cabinet, the State Council, to call for the end of “oversized, xenocentric, weird” buildings), Liu’s output remained quiet and unpretentious — even when the scale of his commissions grew. By Liu’s own admission, his firm was always too small to tackle the skyscrapers or mixed-use mega-projects that redrew China’s skylines. But as his oeuvre came to encompass corporate real estate and urban regeneration, his motivations still lay elsewhere. “I am not very interested in the tendency of making taller and bigger buildings,” he said. “I am not necessarily consciously resisting it. I am just not very interested.” Everyday architecture Instead, Liu seeks to redress some of the ills generated by his country’s rampant urbanization. “China’s cities are developing very fast, so they face two major challenges,” he explained. “One is the relationship with public space, and the other is the relationship with nature. I think my works focus on these two aspects.” Symbiosis between nature and architecture plays out at Liu’s ambitious West Village, an inner-city Chengdu block transformed into a courtyard but at a neighborhood scale. Sloping pathways transport cyclists and pedestrians around a five-story structure that encircles soccer pitches and lush greenery, a park reimagined vertically. This huge public gesture is accompanied by many tiny ones. For paving, Liu used bricks perforated with holes and filled with soil, allowing grass to sprout through the middle. Related article
      The scenic garden that became China’s secretive seat of power A few miles away, the Shuijingfang Museum has been constructed using similarly thoughtful building blocks: “Rebirth Bricks.” Created by Liu’s firm using rubble from the Wenchuan earthquake, which devastated the Sichuan region in 2008, the reconstructed bricks (made by mixing the rubble with wheat stalks and cement) have been employed in several of his projects. It’s an innovation that typifies why Liu is celebrated for practicing a kind of everyday architecture in which local context reigns large. But does this mean the architect’s vision will always be restricted to China, the country he most intimately understands? Despite designing the first overseas pavilion for London’s Serpentine Gallery in Beijing in 2018 and lecturing at institutions including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and London’s Royal Academy of Arts, Liu has never completed a project abroad. Asked whether he would relish the prospect of a prestigious international commission, an opportunity winning the Pritzker Prize will surely present, Liu said his approach could indeed be adapted to foreign contexts with sufficient research and preparation. “From the perspective of method and methodology, there is actually no problem in doing it abroad,” he said, adding: “As long as I am fully familiar with the place, I think (my) set of methods is completely applicable.” CNN’s Hassan Tayir contributed to this story.",,0.2176845669746399
"K-pop band NewJeans played a sold-out show and debuted a new song in Hong Kong on Sunday — just days after a South Korean court upheld an injunction prohibiting the group from carrying out independent musical or commercial activities. But the band’s members then shocked an 11,000-strong crowd at the ComplexCon Hong Kong festival by announcing they are now taking a break “out of respect” for the temporary ruling. On Friday, the Seoul Central District Court sided with record company Ador in its long-running legal dispute with NewJeans, saying the band’s attempt to rename itself and break away from the label could “seriously damage” the latter’s reputation. Speaking on stage, band member Pham Ngoc Han, who goes by Hanni, said the group’s decision to “pause all activities… wasn’t easy,” but that “we believe this is something we need to do.” Carrying prepared messages on slips of paper, each member addressed their fans (who are affectionately known as “bunnies”) in both Korean and English. Audible disappointment rippled through Hong Kong’s AsiaWorld-Expo, where the band was performing for the first time since attempting to rebrand as NJZ last month. A post shared by CNN (@cnn) Danielle Marsh, who goes by Danni, said on stage: “As strong as we are trying to stay, it is honestly taking a bit of a mental and emotional toll on us.” The five-piece group has repeatedly claimed its contract with Ador is void amid allegations of mistreatment. The band’s members have accused the label of “manipulation,” “deliberate miscommunications” and workplace harassment. Ador has meanwhile asserted that NewJeans remains under contract, arguing that it cannot carry out entertainment activities without the label’s approval. The record company — which is a subsidiary of Hybe, the entertainment giant behind K-pop acts including BTS — has also disputed allegations of mistreatment, telling CNN via email that most of NewJeans’ claims “have arisen from misunderstandings.” The lawsuit filed by Ador will be heard in full on April 3. In a conciliatory statement, shared with CNN prior to the band’s Hong Kong show, Ador expressed support for the performance — on condition it took place under the name NewJeans, not NJZ. The group appeared to approach the matter delicately, with neither moniker appearing on screens flanking the stage, despite the festival’s other acts being explicitly named. Related article
      For those seeking K-pop stardom, the path can be long and grueling But the name NJZ did briefly appear as part of visuals projected behind the group, while some band members wore tights saying “Chapter NJZ.” A booth on the festival grounds meanwhile sold merchandise with different NJZ logos, including plushie keychains, hats and T-shirts, with some dedicated fans spending hours in line to purchase the items. Danni addressed the issue on stage, saying: “No matter what our name is, no matter what kind of tough time we’ve been through, I feel like to be able to share a moment like this with everyone, is what we live for.” The band also appeared to avoid playing songs from its back catalog, with each member performing solo covers of other artists before coming together to debut a new song, “Pit Stop.” On X, a hashtag referencing the band’s “re-debut” had over 50,000 posts within hours of the show. Fans at the AsiaWorld-Arena meanwhile expressed support for the band — and disappointment with NewJeans’ planned hiatus. “I hope they can keep staying strong, fight this battle well,” said 25-year-old fan Soie So. “We know this is going to be hard to win. To be honest, at that moment (when the band announced a pause on activities) I just felt very touched. I thought they’re very brave.” But despite fans’ backing, Friday’s ruling is a major setback for the group, according to legal experts familiar with the case. Speaking to CNN on Friday, Sangrock Kho, a lawyer at South Korea’s Law Firm Pil, said the court’s decision to uphold the injunction suggests NewJeans’ legal case is “either extremely weak or virtually nonexistent.” Related article
      K-pop act NewJeans unveils new identity — and a new name “Under the Korean judicial system, in cases like this where an agency files an injunction to suspend an artist’s activities, the proceedings are generally very favorable to the artist,” he said over email. “This is because courts are usually extremely reluctant to issue injunctions that could cause irreparable harm to an artist’s career by restricting their freedom of occupation. “Given that, the fact that the court has nevertheless issued this type of injunction suggests that, after reviewing all the claims, evidence, and extensive presentation materials … the court concluded that NewJeans’ argument — that the breakdown in trust was entirely caused by Hybe and Ador — lacks sufficient legal basis.” NewJeans emerged as one of South Korea’s most successful pop acts after storming to the top of the country’s charts with debut single “Attention” in 2022. The band achieved international success less than a year later with EP “Get Up” (featuring the crossover hit “Super Shy”), which reached number 1 on the US Billboard 200.

"In the year 112, a Roman governor in modern-day Turkey had his first encounter with members of a strange religious cult called “Christiani.” The governor had heard reports the cult followed an obscure criminal who had been tortured and executed by the Romans. His followers, though, believed that their leader was still somehow alive. They met in each others’ homes for communal meals where, rumor had it, they practiced cannibalism by drinking the blood of their leader and held orgies. The governor became even more puzzled when he summoned two leaders from the cult for interrogation. He wrote about the encounter. “I believe it all the more necessary to find out the truth from two slave women, whom they call deaconesses, even by torture,” he wrote to the Roman Emperor Trajan.” I found nothing but depraved and immoderate superstition.” He assured Trajan that he had deployed the firm hand of Rome to halt the “contagion.” The governor, Pliny the Younger, would go on to some renown. He would write additional letters that gave historians crucial insight into the Roman Empire. And he would provide a harrowing first-person account of the volcanic eruption that buried the city of Pompeii. But he would miss the seismic religious shift that literally stared him in the face. The obscure cult would become the dominant faith in Rome and the most widely practiced religion in the world. The cross, an instrument of torture used by the Roman government to publicly lynch political revolutionaries, would “come to serve as the most globally recognized symbol of a god that there has ever been,” according to the scholar Tom Holland, in his book, “Dominion: How the Christian Revolution remade the World.” This improbable rise of Christianity is what many of the world’s estimated 2 billion Christians will celebrate today. The holiest day of the Christian calendar commemorates what Christians believe is the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, symbolized by the empty tomb. But the miracle of Easter didn’t end there. What happened across Rome in the years that followed was in some ways just as astonishing. Before Christianity became a religion, it was the Resistance — a poor people’s campaign that began in a Roman backwater, took on one of the most ruthless and militaristic empires in world history, and won. How did the first Christians do it? And what can today’s resistance movements facing tyrannical regimes learn from their success? The early Christians tapped into a spiritual need This is not a typical Easter sermon topic. The Easter miracle, though, cannot be explained exclusively through a spiritual lens. It’s also a story of power — about people who seemed to have none but rose up to defeat an empire. The first Christians faced challenges that would be familiar to anyone in authoritarian states or failing democracies today. They lived in a political system where a predatory elite amassed almost all the wealth. They faced a repressive regime that used fear to silence internal critics and enforce conformity. They faced the prospect of being arbitrarily arrested without due process and whisked off to prison or disappeared. The early Christians faced a government that had perfected a form of proactive brutality that made political change seem impossible, says Obery M. Hendricks, a social activist and author of “The Politics of Jesus.” When the Romans heard that a group of demonstrators had assembled near Jesus’ hometown of Nazareth to protest excessive taxation, they deployed their own version of shock and awe. “Roman legions came in and killed folks, crucifying 3,000 of them,” Hendricks says. “These people weren’t doing anything violent. They were just protesting. But the Roman empire said, no, we don’t play that. They killed folks if they thought they might be a threat.” And yet these first Christians still triumphed. The conventional Easter story says they beat the Romans because of their beliefs and courage. That is partially true. Christians preached a message of “God is love,” which tapped into a spiritual need that Rome’s pagan religions could not meet. But they also shrewdly employed two lesser-known tactics that offer lessons for resistance movements today — whether these movements identify with the left, the right or somewhere in between. Lesson No. 1: Step into the compassion gap The Romans’ capacity for cruelty created an opening for dissident movements. They committed the mistake that tyrannical leaders often commit — they overreached. They were too callous to deliver tangible economic benefits to most of their citizens. The Christian movement stepped into this compassion gap and used it as a wedge to amass power. It’s hard to imagine today how awful life was for most people in ancient Rome. If you watch Hollywood’s sword-and-sandal movies of the 1950s and 1960s, Rome seemed filled with clean streets and well-scrubbed citizens. But life in places where Christianity took root was miserable, according to Rodney Stark, author of “The Rise of Christianity,” one of the most influential books about the faith’s early years. Most people in Roman cities lived in “filth beyond our imagining,” Stark wrote. They shared smoky, dark spaces with limited water and means of sanitation. Human corpses — even infants — were abandoned in the streets. The smell of sweat, urine and feces permeated everything. “The stench of these cities must have been overpowering for many miles — especially in warm weather — and even the richest Romans must have suffered,” writes Stark, who died in 2022. “No wonder they were so fond of incense.” A tiny elite controlled virtually all the wealth and political power. Most people lived one financial emergency away from irreversible doom. In rural areas, it was not uncommon for people to die of starvation from famines or a bad harvest. There was no Medicaid in ancient Rome. The average life expectancy was about 35 years, due to high rates of infant mortality. Many of those that lived suffered chronic health conditions, including “swollen eyes, skin rashes and lost limbs,” Stark recounts. The first Christians offered what was arguably Rome’s first social safety net. When epidemics swept through the cities and many leaders and wealthy citizens fled to the countryside, they stayed behind to nurse the ill and the dying. In time, Christians would establish orphanages, hospitals and food-delivery systems. The Roman world was full of stories of pagan gods rising from the dead, but the compassion Christians displayed was new. “There was nothing like a welfare state in Rome,” Andrew Crislip, a historian and an authority on early Christianity, tells CNN. “Even doctors in time of plagues would get out of town. One of the principles of ancient medicine was if a patient appears to be hopeless, do not treat (them). Christians did not have such compunction. They were willing to treat the hopeless.” These early Christians also offered a different economic model. They collected money for the poor and eventually established poorhouses. And in the New Testament’s Book of Acts, which recounts the rise of the church, they redistributed their wealth. “All the believers were one in heart and mind,” says Acts 4:32. “No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.” These Christians followed the adage, “First bread, then religion.” Their willingness to meet the physical and economic needs of the people gave them credibility. Scot McKnight, a biblical scholar and host of the podcast “Kingdom Roots,” says the first Christians formed “a socio-economic community of justice,” inspired by Jesus. His first public sermon in the Gospel of Luke was about economic justice, or “good news to the poor.” Jesus routinely criticized wealthy people who were indifferent to the poor. He stood in the tradition of Jewish prophets who condemned greed and evoked the concept of “Jubilee,” a tradition from Leviticus 25 in which kings freed slaves and forgave debts to prevent perpetual cycles of poverty and promote social justice. McKnight sees echoes of the first church’s message in a modern-day socialist: Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who has been drawing huge crowds across the US on his current “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. Sanders has long condemned the gap between the haves and have-nots in America, and political analysts say his message resonates now because he’s tapped into mounting anger over wealth disparities. “Bernie’s quest for justice is an inherently Biblical view,” says McKnight, author of “The Jesus Creed.” “The prophets of Israel — Jesus, the early church in Jerusalem, even (the apostle) Paul — all believed in economic justice.” Lesson No. 2: Lean on support from others as an antidote to fear Hollywood movies propagated another myth about early Christians: that relentless persecution by Rome fanned their growth. In this telling, the blood of Christian martyrs facing lions rather than renouncing their faith eventually transformed the Roman empire. There’s no doubt that Roman persecution was a factor in the growth of the church. But historians say Rome’s violent persecution of Christians was sporadic, and the number of martyrs has been exaggerated. There was another factor that helped Christianity spread. Its leaders disarmed one of the major weapons tyrants use to crush resistance movements. Repressive regimes don’t just instill fear in people — they also breed indifference. People check out of civic involvement. They stop following the news or politics. They don’t talk about their beliefs with family or friends because they’re afraid of informers or because they don’t believe it will make a difference. This is the atmosphere that Vladimir Putin has instilled in Russia through the manipulation of information via state-controlled media. People don’t know what to believe, so they don’t believe in anything. But support from friends and family can offer an antidote to fear and apathy — for early Christians, and for others throughout history. This is what James Zwerg, a civil rights activist, discovered when he was attacked by a White mob in 1961 at an Alabama bus station. The photograph of a bloodied Zwerg, standing next to the late John Lewis, the congressman and legendary activist, became a rallying cry for the civil rights movement. Zwerg says he couldn’t have endured the beating without the friendships he developed with people like Lewis. “Each of us was stronger because of those we were with,” Zwerg recounted in “Children of the Movement,” my book about the children of prominent figures of the civil rights era. “If I was beaten, I knew I wasn’t alone. I could endure more because I knew everybody there was giving me their strength. Even as someone else was being beaten, I would give them strength.” It may be hard to believe today, but Christianity was once considered a form of social deviancy. Many Romans thought Christians were ridiculous or dangerous. A major reason why the faith ultimately triumphed in Rome is that many people were motivated by the same sentiments that ultimately power resistance movements everywhere: personal loyalty to friends and family. Many people didn’t join the movement because of its doctrinal appeal alone. They joined because their family or friends reached out to them. Stark writes that for many early Christians, joining the faith was “not about seeking or embracing a theology; it was about bringing one’s religious behavior into alignment with that one one’s friends and family members.” The first Christians also offered believers an array of personal relationships that were previously unseen in their world. Rome was a society divided by entrenched ethnic, racial and class divisions. But early Christians largely erased these hierarchies. Greeks, Jews, Romans — rich and poor — all worshipped together in homes and built close relationships with one another. They accepted women as leaders and — shockingly at the time — treated slaves as human beings of inherent worth. Slaves were so despised in the ancient world that “Roman men no more hesitated to use slaves and prostitutes to relieve themselves of their sexual needs than they did to use the side of a road as a toilet,” Holland, the historian, writes in “Dominion.” “In Latin, the same word, meio, meant both ejaculate and urinate,” Holland writes. Unlike today, when some activists reject allies who don’t fit all their ideological requirements, early Christians practiced coalition building. They appealed to as many people as they could. “Christians spread because believed their religion was universal,” says Crislip, the historian who teaches at Virginia Commonwealth University. “Most other religions did not want to proselytize. They didn’t attempt to covert other people to their way of life. Christians from the beginning said this is a religion that is radically inclusive — a way of life for everyone.” How the Christian movement evolved After years of employing these strategies, the Christians’ movement grew so popular and entrenched in Rome that political leaders discovered they couldn’t get rid of it. It became a force for social stability, not dissent. A pivotal moment came when the emperor Constantine legalized Christianity and used the might of the Roman empire to give it institutional support. He became the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity. Something was lost, though, when the Christian resistance triumphed. Scholars say the church won, in part, because its leaders eventually softened their message of resistance. Salvation became solely about the afterlife instead of deliverance from oppressive conditions on earth. Crislip says the church eventually promoted “more quietism and compliance” in Rome. In time, the church itself became oppressive, giving us the Inquisition and leaders who sanctioned slavery. And yet for millions, the miracle of Easter continues to inspire. For many, it means that “The Caesars among us don’t get the final word,” Andrew Thayer, an episcopal priest, wrote in a recent essay. History didn’t record the names of the two young women who were interrogated by Pliny the Younger. Most historians assume they were executed because they would not recant. But their courage lives on. We still talk about them today. They embodied one of the most overlooked elements of the Easter story: The Easter miracle isn’t confined to an empty tomb. In some ways, the greatest miracle is what started the day after.

"A tariff reprieve from President Donald Trump sent global markets soaring on Wednesday, with the White House saying it’s been in touch with dozens of countries about striking deals, lining up calls and meetings in the coming weeks. But one country was conspicuously absent from any outreach: China As the rest of the world received a 90-day respite, Trump escalated tariffs on China, saying the US will now charge an extra 145% on all Chinese goods that arrive in the US. In response, Beijing ratcheted up its own tariffs on American goods Friday to 125%, and the country’s leader — who Trump is urgently working to engage — warned China was “not afraid” of a prolonged trade conflict. In private discussions hours before China announced new retaliatory tariffs, the Trump administration warned Chinese officials against such a move, according to a source familiar with the discussions. The Chinese were also told – once again – that Chinese President Xi Jinping should request a call with US President Donald Trump. Instead, US officials woke up to news of increased Chinese tariffs and no request for a leader level call. Xi also made comments that only dug him in further. “For over 70 years, China’s development has relied on self-reliance and hard work — never on handouts from others, and it is not afraid of any unjust suppression,” Xi said according to state broadcaster CCTV during his meeting with the Spanish prime minister. An unprecedented trade war between the world’s two economic superpowers is quickly taking shape, with both countries waiting for the other to blink. Two senior White House officials tell CNN that the US will not reach out to China first. Trump has told his team that China must be the first to make the move, as the White House believes it is Beijing that has chosen to retaliate and further escalate the trade war. Related live-story
      Latest on Trump’s presidency as trade war shifts to China That stance has been conveyed to Beijing for roughly two months, with Trump’s team clearly telling Chinese officials that Xi should request a call with Trump. But Beijing has repeatedly refused to arrange a leader-level phone call, according to three sources familiar with the official communications. One hurdle, Trump’s team believes, is Xi’s desire not to be seen as weak by making the first move and approaching the US for talks. Trump, who envisions a grand bargain with China that increases US exports, cracks down on fentanyl exports and restructures TikTok for US users, has suggested Beijing would come around. “China wants to make a deal. They just don’t know how quite to go about it,” Trump said on Wednesday during an event at the White House. “You know, it’s one of those things they don’t know quite – They’re proud people.” Looking for the proper channel But for months, US and Chinese leaders have been talking past each other, allowing relations to sour as each country’s overtures go unanswered. Behind the scenes, official channels at the working level are active, but high-level dialogue has not been happening. Meanwhile, unofficial channels have proven unproductive, according to three sources briefed on the situation, paving the way for a game of economic chicken with a costly and uncertain end. China’s reliance on strict protocol and desire to prepare Xi for any call of this magnitude is fundamentally at odds with how Trump does business, some current and former officials say, which they point to as the main hangup in trying to get productive talks underway. China has been trying to set up a back channel, like it had with President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, but so far that effort has been unsuccessful. The US objection, according to officials: The Trump administration has balked at China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi serving as the interlocutor, suggesting that Wang is not close enough to Xi’s inner circle and cannot be trusted. Chinese officials have been presented with the specific names of people that the Trump White House would like to engage with instead, but China won’t budge, sources say. Further inflaming tensions, the Chinese readout of a call between Wang and Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this year appeared to misrepresent the contents of the call, Rubio later said. “That didn’t happen, at least not on the call, or at least maybe their interpreter didn’t want to interpret it that way,” Rubio said of the Chinese claim that Rubio was warned not to overstep himself. While some communication between the sides has been brokered by China’s ambassador to the US, the dearth of a principal-level channel has been problematic in arranging a call that the Trump administration says is necessary. Two senior White House officials told CNN that Trump would be happy for communication to begin below the leader-level if it brought about results. Despite Trump officials publicly saying that Trump will dictate his engagement with Xi – National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC Thursday morning that Trump “will decide” when conversations begin – it is clear that the ball is in China’s court for the time being. At least that’s how Trump officials see it. But that’s not the view in Beijing. “The door to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and equality,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday.  “If the US chooses confrontation, China will respond in kind. Pressure, threats, and blackmail are not the right ways to deal with China.” Amid the standoff, the White House has sought to prioritize trade deals with Japan, South Korea and Vietnam in order to pressure Beijing, a senior White House official said. Current and former US officials aren’t ruling out the possibility of putting in place an unexpected preparation channel for a possible Xi-Trump call, but former US officials say the key is ensuring the Chinese they aren’t sending Xi in for an ambush — especially after the tongue-lashing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky received in the Oval Office. “The Chinese in any case, are reluctant to put their leader in the position that Zelensky found himself in,” said Danny Russel, a former assistant secretary of State for East Asia and currently vice president of the Asian Society Policy Institute. “They want to ensure that some of the groundwork is laid for a meeting, and that there’s some ground rules established.” ‘Mutually-assured destruction’ Chinese officials have sought avenues to reach Trump directly, often through business leaders who have his ear. When Xi dispatched Vice President Han Zheng to Washington as the highest-ranking Chinese envoy to ever attend a presidential swearing-in, Han also took a meeting with Elon Musk. The billionaire Tesla CEO has business in China and has also wielded enormous influence in the early days of the Trump administration. Chinese officials had hoped to establish more direct lines of communication with the new Trump administration, using Musk as an intermediary, one person familiar with the matter said. But so far, those attempts haven’t been fruitful. China has considered kneecapping the operations of blue-chip US companies in China such as Apple, Tesla, Caterpillar and Starbucks. Ultimately, according to two sources briefed on the discussions, Beijing backed off that idea – worried that Chinese consumers would revolt, and the Chinese Communist Party could lose the potential for lucrative executive backchannels.

      Can China win a US tariff war? But the CCP is still weighing strategic options to hit back against Washington beyond simply raising import duties. China will likely begin buying soybeans and agricultural products from Brazil instead of the US heartland, as it did during Trump’s first-term trade war. “Look at where they’re blacklisting US companies, hitting US farmers, cutting us off from critical minerals – that’s a toolkit that they’re very comfortable wielding,” said Melanie Hart, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. “They have experimented with it in many other countries. They’ve been developing it for years. They have a bunker that they’ve been building for this moment.” Asked what pain threshold either country is willing to bear, sources in touch with both governments couldn’t say. But one thing is clear: How far either country moves into leveraging non-tariff weapons to fight back could determine how dangerous the economic conflict could become. Beijing has banned the export of a handful of rare earth minerals required for manufacturing certain goods. Moving to ban the export of all rare earth minerals or selling off the mountain of US Treasury bonds it’s amassed would be seen as taking the conflict to the next level. “If China moves to fully throttle the US economy, all shackles are off,” said a former US official briefed on the state of play. “A trade war of that magnitude is an act of war.” Which country has more leverage in such a conflict depends on who you ask. Peter Navarro, Trump’s uber-hawk, has suggested Beijing can’t afford to escalate to that level. Others suggest that’s a naive depiction of an authoritarian leader wielding the full power of a non-market economy subsidized by his government. “That’s absolutely incorrect,” one source in touch with both governments suggested of Navarro’s belief. “This is going to be mutually assured destruction.” Some experts suggest it’s Xi who has the upper hand, having bolstered his political standing at home and earning more room to maneuver before engaging Trump. “Xi Jinping is in a much stronger political position as a result of the perceived attacks by the Trump administration, and he is in a better position to convince the Chinese people to absorb whatever economic pain the tariffs may cause,” Russel said. Matt Pottinger, who served as Trump’s deputy national security advisor, and Liza Tobin, who served as his China director on the National Security Council, described the divide in the Free Press as a “messy breakup” and a “zero-sum contest” whose settlement will bring consequences for the rest of the world. The superpowers, they said, are evenly matched – but have different goals. “While Trump has seized the upper hand in the trade war, Xi is gaining ground in areas that may be even more consequential: artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, and the military might required to seize the most important piece of real estate in the world – Taiwan.” Trump’s first term regrets During Trump’s time out of office after his loss in 2020, he frequently brooded about the shortcomings of the trade agreements he struck with China during his first term. While he enjoyed a warm relationship with Xi, including a Xi visit to Mar-a-Lago and a splashy Trump visit to Beijing in 2017, their partnership soured in the latter years of his first term. Trump has bemoaned what he said were weak officials who allowed China to renege on some the agreements it made to purchase large amounts of American goods, including agricultural products. China has cited the Covid pandemic as the reason it did not fulfill the terms of the deal. Back in office, Trump has discussed striking a more wide-ranging deal with China that would extend beyond trade to other areas of potential cooperation, such as new investments and commitments by China to buy more American products. Complicating that effort is the fact that a first-term trade deal aimed at selling more to China has yielded little result, and Trump’s hawkish national security team previously has expressed reservations about letting Beijing invest more in the US. Trump also came into office vowing to crack down on fentanyl coming from China to the US. In his first days in office, Trump imposed a 10% tariff on China – along with threatened and tariffs on Canada and Mexico – citing the role of Chinese suppliers in the fentanyl trade. Shortly after a conversation between Trump and Xi in mid-January, the CCP submitted a proposal related to curbing fentanyl production to the US Embassy in Beijing. The embassy did not respond to the proposal, which it privately derided. Beijing was furious, according to the source familiar with the two governments. Last week, Beijing came forward with a more substantial offer, after the administration had been pushing them to do so. But it remains to be seen whether Trump would seriously consider that proposal – and any movement toward a TikTok deal – as a way to knock down tariffs that have risen exponentially and cleaved the two countries’ economies. “Might Trump’s dealmaking instinct reassert itself and overtake his decoupling instinct?” Pottinger and Tobin asked. “But a comprehensive ‘grand bargain’ that sets aside the US-China arch-rivalry has never been more distant.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

"A British university has given back four spears taken more than 250 years ago from an aboriginal community in Australia by explorer Captain James Cook. Trinity College Cambridge permanently repatriated the spears to the La Perouse Aboriginal Community at a ceremony Tuesday, according to a joint statement from the college and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), which supported the move. The four spears are the last remaining examples from a collection of 40 which Cook’s records show his expedition took from the Gweagal people living at Kamay on April 29, 1770. “The spears were pretty much the first point of European contact, particularly British contact with Aboriginal Australia,” said Ray Ingrey, director of the Gujaga Foundation, a research organization working in the La Perouse community, in the statement. “I think for us it’s a momentous occasion that where Australia’s history began, in 1770 on the shores of Botany Bay at Kurnell, the spears that were undoubtedly taken without permission are returned to the rightful people.” Cook traveled to Australia and New Zealand on the HMS Endeavour, marking the first known European contact with eastern Australia. The resulting British colonization of Australia resulted in the introduction of foreign diseases, displacement, and massacres against the aboriginal people. The spears were given to Trinity College in 1771 and have been held in the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA) in Cambridge since the early 20th century. Some members of the La Perouse Aboriginal Community are direct descendants of those who crafted the spears, according to the statement. “They are an important connection to our past, our traditions, and cultural practices, and to our ancestors,” said Noeleen Timbery, chair of the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council, in the statement. “Our Elders have worked for many years to see their ownership transferred to the traditional owners of Botany Bay.” The college agreed to return the spears in March 2023 after loaning them to museums in Australia in 2015 and 2020. Related article
      Wreckage of Captain Cook’s HMS Endeavour discovered “This is an important day at Trinity for all parties involved in what has been a rewarding and respectful process, and ultimately a remarkable journey,” said Sally Davies, master of Trinity, in the statement. “This is the right decision and Trinity is committed to reviewing the complex legacies of the British empire, not least in our collections.” The spears will be displayed at a new visitor center which is going to be constructed at Kurnel, Kamay. Cambridge’s decision to return the spears to the La Perouse community echoes recent decisions taken by other universities and cultural institutions to return artistic and cultural artifacts that were stolen or looted. Decades of campaigning by Indigenous activists has put pressure on museums to reconsider the provenance of collections and grapple with the cultural legacy of colonialism.",,0.2101510614156723
"Sydney, 1994. A dimly-lit bar, wrapped in tinsel curtains and the fragmented, twirling light from a disco ball. Tick Belrose (played by Hugo Weaving) is on stage lip syncing as his drag persona Mitzi Del Bra; clad in a silver sequin dress with matching gloves and a bouffant blonde wig. This is the opening scene from “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert”, which first screened at Cannes Film Festival 30 years ago this month. “I made that dress for myself,” Tim Chappel, one of the movie’s costume designers, told CNN. “The weekend before, I’d gone to the Miss Teen USA beauty pageant as Miss Silicon Valley, because (the dress) had joke plastic boobs inside. Stephan (Elliott, the film’s writer and director) was really on my case because I wanted to do lots of obscure stuff (to costume the film ), and he wanted (the principal characters in drag)  to look like ladies. So I said we can make him look like a lady and take the piss at the same time, because the boobs are clearly from a party shop. And I’d already made it, so it was cheap!” In the film, Tick scoops up his freshly widowed friend Bernadette Bassenger (played by Terence Stamp) and flamboyant, fellow drag queen Adam Whitley/ Felicia Jollygoodfellow (actor Guy Pearce) and goes west — both musically and literally — for a road trip across the Outback in their affectionately-christened bus: Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. “We were just having a laugh!” Chappel said, recalling the film’s production. Sydney 30 years ago was at a unique point in time and culture; not yet tethered to the rest of the world via the internet, the somewhat isolated drag scene was able to cultivate its own sprawling visual language for storytelling and sexual politics, beyond the more recognizable female impersonation that Elliott might have initially pushed for. “It was my first opportunity to really express myself as a designer, and I wasn’t going to let anybody stand in my way,” Chappel said. “I just really wanted to make (the film’s wardrobe) unique and interesting.” Serving looks, on a budget Film critic Susan Barber, despite calling out the problematic handling of female and non-white characters, dubbed “Priscilla” the “darling” of the Cannes Film Festival after it premiered there in 1994. The film quickly drew attention for its costuming in particular, winning Chappel and fellow designer Lizzy Gardiner an Oscar in 1995. Among many iconic looks is the flip-flop (or ‘thong,’ if you’re Australian) dress. It was made from shoes Chappel bought for $15 in Target using his mother’s staff discount — “which was good,” he said, “because that was about three quarters of our budget.” Their mandated thriftiness meant that several costumes, “made with hot glue, chicken wire and duct tape”, fell apart not long after the cameras stopped rolling. The flip-flop dress survived, though — that was made with cable ties, as well as duct tape. Related article
      The US has a rich drag history. Here’s why the art form will likely outlast attempts to restrict it Two years passed between Chappel first joining the project and its (limited) funding being secured. The time allowed him to play with and re-do ideas, evolving initial plans into their extravagant final form. In one scene, for instance, Tick, Adam and Bernadette put on a fireside performance of Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” for a group of First Nations people. Rather than mimic Gaynor’s hairstyle directly, however, Chappel spent his elongated preparation time adding an increasing bouquet of flowers to the trio’s headpieces, until eventually there was no hair left at all. “I think that’s definitely one of the most iconic looks,” drag artist and costumer Philmah Bocks told CNN. Bocks has been designing costumes for 30 years, having broken into the drag scene around the same time “Priscilla” was hitting screens. “The thong dress is a very iconic piece too, because I think that’s very (stereotypically) Australian. And of course the big finale look, with the emus on top of their heads. That’s the beauty of ‘Priscilla’: they’ve really captured a moment in Australian time and used Australian culture and flora and fauna to create these wonderful pieces.” “The art of drag costuming is the ability to turn drab into fab,” she continued. “’Priscilla’ showed us a lot of that, because a lot of that type of design work was happening in and around Sydney in the early ‘90s. There was this sort of explosion of drag costuming that went beyond couture. Of course, queens were also on a budget. You couldn’t always afford hundreds or even thousands of dollars to create the most beautiful pieces, but you could kind of get there with stuff we found in a dumpster! It’s what you do with it that makes the difference… I’ve been replicating (Chappel’s) costumes for 30 years, so I’ve got a lot to thank him for!” Related article
      In Miami Beach, a new street art installation celebrates the city’s vibrant drag scene Bocks is known for her foam, or ‘Phoam’, wigs, a look also popularized in “Priscilla” which she’s made for London’s hit musical “Priscilla the Party!” as well as for Katy Perry on an episode of “American Idol”. These creations also follow the “drab to fab” ethos: they’re made from materials bought at the hardware store. “I remember buying this product from the hardware store knowing full well that it was going on Katy Perry’s head, and that made me laugh a little,” Bocks said. “Of course, by the time I’d finished with it, it looked nothing like it had originally.” Spirit of Ecstasy Perhaps more so than any other costume, the enduring image from “Priscilla” is Adam/ Felicia’s opera performance atop the moving bus, decked out in hundreds of meters of flowing silver lamé. Its inspiration came from the Rolls Royce “Spirit of Ecstasy” bonnet ornament, though once again the final product went far beyond the script’s guidance. Felicia’s windswept aria comes after their bus is scrawled in homophobic graffiti — a reflection of the community’s resilience against hate and disaster in real life. “Priscilla” received her standing ovation at Cannes seven months before Australia decriminalized homosexuality at federal level; three years before Tasmania would become the final state to pass similar legislation, and at a time when the AIDS crisis was still at large. Despite that, Chappel remembers the film as coming at a positive turning point: new HIV treatments were being trialed, replacing toxic doses of the AZT drug that had previously been offered. “All of a sudden there was hope. Out of the blue,” he said. ““Priscilla”, I think, captures that energy of everybody coming back to life.” Stephan Elliott has recently announced that a sequel to “Priscilla” is in the works, with Chappel on board. The newest addition to the empire will join “Priscilla’s” musical adaptation, which has toured the globe in Chappel’s costumes since 2006. The film’s legacy can also be seen in Australia’s drag scene today and, since 2021, has been broadcast to new audiences via contestants on “Rupaul’s Drag Race Down Under”. “If I get run over by a bus tomorrow,” Chappel said, “the last little thought that goes through my head – besides ‘ouch’ – is going to be ‘I’ve left an impression, that’s cool’.”",,0.30062752962112427
"The fast-worsening trade war between the United States and China – the planet’s premier geopolitical powers, whose economies are intricately entwined – threatens to wreak severe damage on both nations and will send shockwaves worldwide. Since President Donald Trump launched this potential cataclysm, it’s fair to ask whether he’s got a strategy and how he sees the endgame. As usual, Trump is improvising. His stunning escalation in tariffs on China this week didn’t follow any meaningful formula. He’s acting, as he always does, like a real estate shark, raising the stakes to intolerable levels to seek leverage. It’s the latest manifestation of the “madman theory,” by which Trump conjures the most extreme of circumstances to try to spook his opponents. Perhaps it will work and China, not eager to wreck an economy that no longer pumps out eye-popping growth numbers, will rush to the table. Many China experts believe that Beijing doesn’t want to go to the brink any more than Trump does. The potential consequences of a full-on trade war for both sides might leave them with no option but to step back. But after Trump’s latest raising of the stakes on Thursday when he confirmed tariffs on Chinese goods would now hit 145%, Chinese President Xi Jinping hit back, pushing duties on US goods entering China to 125%. Xi said that China was “not afraid.” There were also new signs that Trump’s team doesn’t appreciate the factors in Beijing driving China’s calculations. CNN’s Kylie Atwood reported that the administration had privately warned the Chinese not to respond to the US tariffs and that Xi should request a call with Trump, a source familiar with the discussions said. Such a move would have implied that the Chinese president was a supplicant to the US president who started the standoff, an intolerable possibility for Beijing. The risks are massive. “We’re now in a huge (trade) war with China, and the tariffs that have been imposed on China are what I would call prohibitive,” former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Zain Asher and Bianna Golodryga on CNN International Thursday. “They’re going to result in massive impacts on the United States and the global economy. No one knows where these policies are headed.” Trump’s tactics assume that the threat of massive consequences will force China into negotiations – as happened in his first term when the two sides reached a trade agreement that was never fully implemented even before the Covid-19 pandemic effectively shut down US relations with Beijing. Related article
      Trump is waiting for Xi to call. The Chinese see it differently But coercing China could backfire, given its vast economic weight and its sensitivity to slights from Western powers it views as trying to thwart its rise. China’s population is unlikely to respond well to threats after years of nationalistic policymaking and propaganda aimed at superseding the United States. Trump insisted Thursday that his personal chemistry with Xi would be decisive. “He’s been, in a true sense, he’s been a friend of mine for a long period of time,” he said at a Cabinet meeting. Trump often reminisces fondly about a visit by Xi to his Mar-a-Lago resort during his first term, when the two munched on “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you’ve ever seen” and he informed his stunned guest about military strikes he’d just ordered in Syria. Cake diplomacy is unlikely in Trump’s second term. Chumminess isn’t really Xi’s style. China prefers negotiations to be conducted in grueling lower-level formal diplomacy. Leader meetings are highly scripted – far from the scenario of big guys getting together in a room and thrashing it out that Trump prefers. “President Xi Jinping … is not a negotiator. His role is not to be engaged in a trade negotiation; instead it’s the working level, the bureaucrats, the functionaries negotiate the deal,” said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “From that perspective, I do see some short-term logistical challenges, even though the intent to de-escalate may still be there in China.” There’s also no chance China will expose its leader to a freewheeling Oval Office session when anything can happen. Just ask Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky after his dressing-down earlier this year. Or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was surprised this week when Trump said he might not lift tariffs in a return for the Jewish state eliminating its trade deficit with the US. But as the global trade war quickly evolved over the past several days, the administration hatched a new idea: use trade agreements with allies to isolate and pressure China. This seems a long shot, however, since the president has alienated nations that he’d need for this, including Canada and those in the European Union. America’s friends have decided the US is an unreliable partner and they’ll have to go their own way. CNN’s Alayna Treene asked Trump to identify his “endgame with China” on Thursday.  The president shook his head when asked if he was waiting for Xi to blink and couldn’t say how he’d resolve the showdown. “Look, for years we’ve been ripped off and taken advantage of by China and others, in all fairness, but … that’s the big one,” Trump said. This is an astonishingly blasé attitude given the ramifications of a conflict between the world’s largest economies that could have incalculable consequences. Why a trade war between the US and China could be so damaging One reason a trade war between the US and China could be so disruptive is that the two economies have become so intertwined. Years of integration have helped both countries. American consumers have enjoyed cheap access to clothes, shoes, electronics such as iPhones, and other consumer goods, which has raised the middle-class quality of life. China has used US trade to expand manufacturing and to lift tens of millions of its people out of poverty. The profits have been pumped into high-tech industries and China’s growing military. In the United States, the downside of this arrangement has been that cheap goods from China have hammered US industries, from steelmaking in the Rust Belt to furniture manufacturing in North Carolina. And the longtime rationale behind the US’ China policy – that economic development would inevitably loosen the grip of Beijing’s communist leaders – did not pan out. China hawks in Washington now argue that the US effectively built its 21st century superpower enemy with its own addiction to cheap consumer goods. Foreign policy analysts used to argue that the enmeshed nature of the China-US relationship would provide a firewall against military conflict. But now the talk is about decoupling, the process of de-integrating the American and Chinese economies – the two powers on either side of the world’s most dangerous geopolitical rivalry. If trade dies out between the US and China, the consequences will be painful. The price of goods that form a vital part of American life could shoot up. This could fuel inflation, worsening the quality of life for millions and hurting consumer confidence, which in turn could tip the US into a recession. In China, a prolonged trade war could particularly hurt small businesses, which are the engine of its economy. Unemployment could rise, which is always a concern for a nation obsessed with keeping a lid on unrest. Western observers often forget that while China’s authoritarian system suppresses dissent, it does have its own form of internal politics that its leaders cannot ignore. This means that a trade war between the US and China could become a grueling test of which populace can take the most economic pain. America turns to the allies it spurned The magnitude of the potential conflict has US officials casting around for a strategy. There is one approach that would leverage American strength and global power and that might have a chance of building pressure on Beijing to act on consistent US complaints about market access, theft of intellectual property, industrial espionage and other issues. There’s only one problem: It would conflict with Trump’s “America first” mantra. In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pointed out that US allies such as Japan, South Korea and India would soon be in trade talks with Washington, as would Vietnam. “Everyone is coming to the table, and basically China is surrounded,” he said. Bessent added that a topic of talks should be a joint goal: “How do we get China to rebalance? That is the big win here.” Kevin Hassett, the head of Trump’s National Economic Council, said Thursday that Trump’s Cabinet meeting would discuss whether the US should make trade deals with allies to create a united anti-China front. America’s power has long been multiplied by its alliance system – a key advantage that China does not enjoy. A common approach between the trading nations of North America and Europe would be hard for Beijing to ignore. Yet everything that Trump has done since he arrived back in the Oval Office has been designed to destroy this group of like-minded democracies. Several times this week he dissed the European Union. “The EU has been very tough over the years … I always say it was formed to really do damage to the United States in trade.” In fact, US policy for years – despite many trade disputes – has been to support a strong EU as a American-allied bloc of prosperity, unity and democracy in a continent that was the epicenter of the bloodiest wars in human history. Fierce anti-Europe sentiment elsewhere in the administration might also be a problem. Vice President JD Vance revealed his distaste for the continent at the Munich Security forum and also in a group chat of officials about air strikes in Yemen. Trump’s provocations in the Western hemisphere could also frustrate any joint anti-China front. Related article
      Old US-Canada relationship is ‘over,’ warns Canadian prime minister A unified North American trading powerhouse has long been seen as a potential bulwark against China. But Trump has repeatedly threatened to annex Canada and has targeted Mexico with some of his toughest tariffs. For months, Canadian politicians like Ontario Premier Doug Ford have been pleading with Trump to link up with Canada to combat China. “We always believe in the Am-Can fortress, working together to make the two strongest nations in the world. That’s what we want to do,” Ford told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. But after weeks of attacks on Canada’s sovereignty, Trump has made it almost impossible for its leaders to cooperate with the US – especially during the current general election campaign north of the border. New Prime Minister Mark Carney has warned that his country’s traditional relationship with Washington is over. The idea of building an anti-China cooperative of US-allied powers isn’t new. In fact, Trump has already shut it down once. On his first day in office in his first term in 2017, Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a group of 12 nations including allies like Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Australia, as well as Japan. The president also ended talks with Europe on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that would have linked the world’s two largest markets. It may already be too late to change course. “The US right now is an incredibly unreliable partner to anyone in the world, and I don’t know how we are going to get back to being reliable,” Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, told Isa Soares on CNN International on Thursday.

"Moments from the end of extra time, Manchester United’s Europa League campaign seemed dead and buried against Lyon. It looked like this was going to be another low point in United’s dismal season: 14th in the Premier League table and now about to exit Europe’s second-tier competition having thrown away a two-goal lead in the quarterfinal. But from the clutches of defeat, the beleaguered home side somehow rescued an astonishing victory, scoring three times in the final six minutes of extra time to claim a 7-6 aggregate win. United now faces Spanish team Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League semifinals, a chance for silverware still very much alive and kicking. “I said in commentary, it’s going to take more than a miracle to get back in it,” said former United defender and TNT Sports pundit Rio Ferdinand. “Now, I’m actually a believer because that was outrageous.” After the first leg in Lyon had ended 2-2 last week, United took a commanding lead in Thursday’s return fixture thanks to first-half goals from Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot. In between those strikes, Bruno Fernandes almost scored a spectacular volley from Dalot’s long pass, his shot thumping off the crossbar. Everything appeared to be playing into United’s hands as the match wore on, but with 20 minutes of normal time remaining, Corentin Tolisso’s header hauled Lyon back into the contest. That was soon followed by Nicolás Tagliafico’s equalizer, which saw United’s lead evaporate in the space of six minutes. With extra time looming, Lyon’s chances of progressing were dented when Tolisso was sent off for a second yellow card, but that did little to quell the French side’s ambition. Rayan Cherki’s strike from the edge of the area in the 104th minute gave the 10 men an advantage before Alexandre Lacazette’s penalty early in the second half of extra time added a fourth goal for Lyon without response from United. Cue one of the most memorable comebacks in European football. Fernandes’ penalty made it 4-3 on the night and 6-5 on aggregate, while Kobbie Mainoo’s neat finish in the 120th minute sparked pandemonium inside Old Trafford. The United fans inside the stadium – those who hadn’t given up hope and headed for an early exit – would have been overjoyed to see the game go to penalties. But the comeback wasn’t finished there. Up stepped Harry Maguire – the central defender being deployed as a makeshift striker – to head the ball into the net in the first minute of stoppage time, an unlikely hero for an improbable victory. According to Opta, United is the first team to score two goals in the 120th minute of a major European match, which also marked the first time that five goals have been scored in extra time. “I think that is why we like this sport so much,” United manager Ruben Amorim told reporters. “All the frustration that a coach has in this season, the bad moments – when you have moments like this, it is all worth it.” Defender Leny Yoro, meanwhile, told TNT Sports that he “(couldn’t) understand what happened,” adding: “We gave everything and thanks to God we won this game … That was crazy.” United will travel to northern Spain for the first semifinal leg against Athletic Bilbao on May 1, while Premier League rival Tottenham, which defeated Germany’s Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 on Thursday, will host Bodø/Glimt – the surprise package of this season’s Europa League – in the other semifinal. Bodø/Glimt shocks Lazio The Norwegian champion entered its quarterfinal tie against Italian side Lazio as a heavy underdog, but was well-placed to reach the final four after a 2-0 win at home in last week’s first leg. Lazio piled on the pressure in Rome’s Stadio Olimpico, reducing the deficit through Valentín Castellanos’ first-half goal before Tijjani Noslin bundled in a dramatic equalizer in the 93rd minute to send the match to extra time. Moments earlier, Andreas Helmersen had missed a glorious chance to seal victory for the visitors. Boulaye Dia scored Lazio’s third with a close-range header to take the lead for the first time in the tie, but Bodø/Glimt, which faced 33 shots over the course of the game, found a response through Helmersen in the 109th minute. The substitute was later sent off for a second yellow card, though the game was destined for a penalty shootout at that point. And with Lazio failing to convert three of its five penalties, Bodø/Glimt became the first Norwegian team to reach the semifinals of a European competition – a remarkable achievement for the town of just 55,000 people located inside the Arctic Circle. “It’s huge. We’re very happy,” said goalkeeper Nikita Haikin, who made two saves in the shootout. “It’s historic, not only for Bodø/Glimt but for all of Norwegian football. “I was angry after the missed chances, but you know that it’s part and parcel of football and that’s why we love it.”",,0.4902880787849426
"Australian police are seeking two people for allegedly vandalizing a century-old Chinese parade dragon and other valuable artefacts at a museum in a small town known for its historic links to China. The vandalism took place last week at the Golden Dragon Museum in Bendigo, about 100 miles northwest of Melbourne, according to the police and head of the museum. Victoria Police said a man and a woman are suspected of damaging AUD$100,000 ($66,900) worth of art and historical items, before making off in a silver Toyota Prado on May 5. “Investigators believe the duo used a liquid to cause damage to multiple statues and paintings,” police said, adding that the suspects were with two children at the time. Among the artefacts attacked was Loong – described by the museum as the “oldest complete imperial processional dragon in the world.” “Loong” is a sacred mythical creature in Chinese culture – usually translated as dragon in English – and is often the protagonist in festivities and rituals. Dragon dances have been documented at ceremonial events since the Han Dynasty (202 BCE to 220 CE) and often involve teams of dancers manipulating a giant dragon puppet through the streets. Bendigo, currently a city of some 100,000 people, has had Chinese residents for more than a century. Chinese immigrants first arrived mostly from southern China in the mid-1800s during the Victorian goldrush and at one point made up 20 percent of the town’s residents. Miners and merchants brought their customs and culture with them to a place they once called “Dai Gum San” - or “Big Gold Mountain,” according to Bendigo Tourism. To this day, a large dragon parade is held every Easter to raise money for a local hospital. The Golden Dragon Museum was opened in 1991 “to document, interpret and preserve the Chinese heritage in Australia” according to the museum’s website. Loong, which dates back 1901, was routinely paraded through the streets of Victoria until the 1970s when it was retired. Hugo Leschen, Chief Executive Officer of the museum, told CNN that they found oily liquid running down Loong’s nose. Its successor Sun Loong, which took over to parade around the Bendigo until it was also retired in 2019, was also damaged, Leschen said, citing stains on the second dragon’s tongue. Other parts of the museum were also targeted. Security camera footage aired on CNN affiliate Nine News showed a woman clad in a white sweater and grey beanie splashing liquid at a Buddhist altar. A man stood next to her in the clip. Stains were also found on at least 35 paintings and several statues of Chinese deities in the temple as well as a garden next door managed by the museum, Leschen said. “With these further attacks it is now evident that this was no random act of mindless vandalism but rather a planned and sustained malicious attack across various heritage, cultural and religious sites for reasons unknown,” he said. The Chinese Community Council of Australia condemned the vandalism in a statement. While police have yet to comment on the motivation, the group is concerned the act “may have been racially motivated.”",,0.24047785997390747
"Art is subjective. And while many artists long to share their work with the world, there’s no guarantee that the audience will understand it, or even like it. That certainly seems to be the case with a painting by indigenous artist Vincent Namatjira, which includes a portrait of Australia’s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart. Rinehart has reportedly called for the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) to remove her portrait, one of 21 individual works that make up a single piece in Namatjira’s exhibition “Australia in Colour,” from display. The exhibition has been running at the gallery in the Australian capital, Canberra, since March. Other subjects in the piece include the late Queen Elizabeth II, American musician Jimi Hendrix, Australian Aboriginal rights activist Vincent Lingiari and the former Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison. Australian media has reported that Rinehart approached the NGA’s director and chair to request the painting’s removal. The NGA said in a statement to CNN Thursday that it “welcomes the public having a dialogue on our collection and displays.” “Since 1973, when the National Gallery acquired Jackson Pollocks’ Blue Poles, there has been a dynamic discussion on the artistic merits of works in the national collection, and/or on display at the Gallery,” the NGA statement continued. “We present works of art to the Australian public to inspire people to explore, experience and learn about art.” Namatjira said in a statement that he paints “people who are wealthy, powerful, or significant – people who have had an influence on this country, and on me personally, whether directly or indirectly, whether for good or for bad.” Related article
      Billionaire dumps Australia netball team in dispute over father’s racist comments “I paint the world as I see it,” he said. “People don’t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, ‘why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?’” “Some people might not like it, other people might find it funny but I hope people look beneath the surface and see the serious side too,” Namatjira added. Rinehart is the executive chairman of Hancock Prospecting, a privately owned mining company that was founded by her father, Lang Hancock. CNN has reached out to Hancock Prospecting for comment but did not receive a response. Rinehart has an estimated net worth of $30.2 billion USD, according to Forbes. She “remained unshakable” at the top of Forbes’ Australia’s 50 Richest list for 2024, the outlet reported in February. Australia’s National Association for the Visual Arts (NAVA) has spoken out to support Namatjira, CNN’s affiliate 9News has reported. “While Rinehart has the right to express her opinions about the work, she does not have the authority to pressure the gallery into withdrawing the painting simply because she dislikes it,” NAVA’s executive director Penelope Benton said, according to 9News. NAVA offered its “unwavering support” to National Gallery of Australia, 9News reported, stating that it was concerned that Rinehart’s demand to remove the portrait “sets a dangerous precedent for censorship and the stifling of creative expression.”",,0.2506691515445709
"Editor’s Note: In July 2024, the ‘Picasso’ artworks detailed in this story were subsequently revealed to be fakes created by museum curator Kirsha Kaechele. A museum in Australia has moved Picasso artworks to a women’s restroom, skirting a discrimination complaint by a male visitor who couldn’t enter an exhibit where the works were previously hung. Two paintings and a drawing by Pablo Picasso  were originally featured in American artist and museum curator  Kirsha Kaechele’s “Ladies Lounge” installation at Tasmania’s Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) –  which opened in December 2020 – “to any and all ladies.” The experiential artwork was billed by the museum as a “tremendously lavish space” where women can indulge in “decadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures” served by a male butler while they peruse art in a green velvet-draped room. But MONA was ordered to stop refusing entry to “persons who do not identify as ladies” after the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled in April that the show violated Australia’s 1998 Anti-Discrimination Act. Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room was indeed part of the art — giving them a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. The Picasso pieces are now displayed in an upgraded restroom with a fully functional toilet dubbed “Ladies Room,” located within the art venue, Kaechele said in an e-mail. “While the Ladies Lounge undergoes a series of reforms to meet the exemptions required for reopening, I’ve been doing a little redecorating. I thought a few of the bathrooms in the museum could do with an update,” she added. “Some Cubism in the cubicles.” On Monday, Kaechele posted on Instagram a video and images of the relocated works in situ, and pointed out that the gendered restroom was also a first for the museum. She encouraged “all ladies” to enjoy the new exhibition. ‘Ladies Lounge’ closed “We never had female toilets at Mona before, they were all unisex. But then the Ladies Lounge had to close thanks to a lawsuit brought on by a man. And I just didn’t know what to do with all those Picassos…,” wrote Kaechele, who is also the wife of MONA’s owner, David Walsh. Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales was barred from entering the “Ladies Lounge” exhibit on April 1 in 2023. Lau, who had paid the $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, believed he experienced direct gender discrimination. “He felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,” read the tribunal’s notes.

Art exhibit about misogyny was only open to women — until a man complained After the judgment, Kaechele said she would challenge the court’s decision in the state’s Supreme Court and offered several possibilities to revive the “Ladies Lounge” concept. Among those ideas included finding loopholes under Section 27 of the Anti-Discrimination Act which lists exceptions on when discrimination against gender would be permitted. In the meantime the lounge closed so that it wouldn’t have to open to men. Kaechele later discussed potential ways to reopen “Ladies Lounge” as a church, school, toilet and more in a Q&A that was published on the museum’s website.",,0.22733041644096375
"China has lifted bans on imports from five major Australian beef processing facilities, the Australian government said on Thursday, in the latest sign of improving relations between the two nations. Beijing has now removed restrictions from eight abattoirs but two remain subject to import bans, the government said. China imposed the bans between 2020 and 2022, around the same time it barred imports of a swathe of commodities including coal, timber and wine from Australia after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origin of COVID-19. The bans applied to certain abattoirs but did not affect others, which meant Australia was still able to ship beef to China. “It was difficult for those particular abattoirs but we still saw beef flowing,” said Matt Dalgleish, an analyst at agricultural consultants Episode 3. He said the removal of the restrictions should still boost Australian shipments to China, which have already risen to their highest level since 2020 as a shrinking cattle herd in the United States, Australia’s main competitor, reduces US exports. Lower US supply may have been one reason for China’s action, Dalgleish said. China was Australia’s second-biggest beef export market last year, receiving 240,000 tons worth around $1.6 billion, Australian trade data shows. Beijing has lifted most of the barriers it imposed on Australian goods since a change of government in Canberra two years ago. A ban on imports of Australian lobsters remains in place. “We continue to press China to remove the remaining trade impediments, including for Australia’s rock lobster industry,” Australian foreign minister Penny Wong, trade minister Don Farrell and agriculture minister Murray Watt said in a joint statement. They said China’s trade impediments at their height impacted Australian exports worth 20.6 billion Australian dollars ($13.6 billion). The reasons China gave for suspending the Australian beef processors were issues over labeling or contamination or cases of COVID-19 among their workers.",,0.21522891521453857
"Australia’s eSafety commissioner has dropped her legal bid to force Elon Musk’s social media site X to hide a violent video of a church stabbing in Sydney from global users. Julie Inman Grant had sought a Federal Court ruling after X failed to fully comply with a takedown order issued under the country’s Online Safety Act following the incident in April. Instead, Inman Grant said Wednesday she would “consolidate action” concerning the removal notice in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), an independent review process that examines decisions taken by the commissioner. “After weighing multiple considerations, including litigation across multiple cases, I have considered this option likely to achieve the most positive outcome for the online safety of all Australians, especially children,” she said in a statement. The eSafety commissioner had wanted X to hide the video for users beyond Australian borders. Musk criticized the request as an excessive overreach by an unelected official that could set a precedent for other countries to demand the removal of sensitive material. “Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian ‘eSafety Commissar’ is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?” Musk posted on X in April. In a statement, X welcomed the latest development as a victory for free speech. “This case has raised important questions on how legal powers can be used to threaten global censorship of speech, and we are heartened to see that freedom of speech has prevailed,” it said. Joanne Gray, a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, said the decision to drop the case was “rational” for a public institution with limited resources. But she added that the question of Australia’s jurisdiction over online content remains unanswered. “[Musk] might claim it’s a victory for free speech but I don’t think that is really what it is. It’s more of a corporate win, and says more about the ability of platform companies to operate outside of the reach of governments,” Gray said. She said the end of the legal action demonstrates the need for a global approach to online regulation, adding that “it’s hard for Australia to fix these issues when it’s acting alone.” The controversial video showed the moment Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was stabbed, allegedly by a 16-year-old assailant, while delivering a sermon at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church in western Sydney. The incident set off a riot outside the church that authorities said was stoked by the rapid distribution of the video online. However, in court filings, lawyers for X argued that it had taken down some URLs seen by an Australian audience, but the video was readily available to view on other sites. “The Video is, and at all material times has been, widely accessible to persons in Australia other than on the X platform, including in its full form on other social media services and various websites,” court documents said. Musk’s lawyers also said the commissioner had failed to consider that the video was shared with the bishop’s consent, not by his assailant. The Assyrian Orthodox cleric was quoted in court filings as supporting the distribution of the video as an exercise in free speech. “Noting our God given right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion, I am not opposed to [the video] remaining on social media,” the bishop said, according to court documents. In her statement Wednesday, Inman Grant defended her decision to pursue the matter, which she said had given the agency an opportunity to test its “novel regulatory powers … to protect Australians from online harm.” “Our sole goal and focus in issuing our removal notice was to prevent this extremely violent footage from going viral, potentially inciting further violence and inflicting more harm on the Australian community. I stand by my investigators and the decisions eSafety made,” the statement said. Inman Grant told Australia’s national broadcaster, the ABC, that she’d been subject to personal attacks, including death threats, from Musk’s supporters. “Targeting a regulator who is here to protect the citizens of Australia is really beyond the pale, but it’s not surprising,” she reportedly told the ABC. X, formerly known as Twitter, has faced ongoing scrutiny over the spread of controversial content on the platform, including hateful speech and conspiracy theories, since it was taken over by Musk in 2022. Last month, the platform named a new head of safety, nine months after its previous safety leader resigned following just seven months in the role.",,0.26689666509628296
"The boss of Qantas Airways has acknowledged the “anger” of thousands of customers who were sold tickets for already-canceled flights. “Everyone feels pain at the anger,” Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson told CNN’s Richard Quest in an exclusive interview at an airline industry conference in Dubai Monday. “It’s not just me; (it’s) 25,000 people that work for us as well. Because not only (did) we let our customers down, we let our people down.” Last August, Australian regulators accused Qantas in a lawsuit of selling tickets for more than 8,000 flights that the airline had already canceled — affecting more than 86,000 customers. Qantas agreed last month to pay 120 million Australian dollars ($79 million) to settle the lawsuit. Of that, about 20 million Australian dollars ($13.3 million) will go to the affected customers. The remaining 100 million Australian dollars ($66.5 million) is a fine — the biggest ever for an Australian airline, according to Reuters. Hudson, who took the helm at Qantas in September, soon after the lawsuit was filed, told Quest the airline is focused on repairing its relationships with passengers and staff. She has “spent a lot of time listening” to the concerns of customers and staff, she said. The airline is investing in improving the in-flight experience, including the food it serves and the Wi-Fi service it offers.

"Buying a vape just got harder in Australia with the introduction of some of the world’s toughest anti-vaping laws that limit the sale of vapes with nicotine to pharmacies. From Monday, users will need to present a doctor’s prescription to a pharmacist to buy vapes, and the choice will be limited to three flavors: mint, menthol and tobacco. Dozens of countries have banned disposable vapes, but with the ban on vape sales in shops, service stations and other small retailers, Australia has introduced “world leading” laws, according to the government. Australian authorities say the move spells the end of colorful branding and fun flavors that authorities say was a ploy to get children hooked on nicotine. Related article
      A new docuseries follows Juul’s catastrophic crash and burn “It’s not often that the parliament gets the opportunity to do something really meaningful and lasting for the health of young Australians,” said Health Minister Mark Butler, after the country’s parliament passed the laws. However, under a political deal that was struck to secure the law’s approval, the restrictions will ease in October, when only minors under 18 will need a prescription. Adults will be able to buy vapes in pharmacies, without a prescription – but the devices may be hard to find after some leading pharmacy chains declared they would refuse to stock them. “Pharmacists are healthcare professionals and community pharmacies do not want to supply this potentially harmful, highly addictive product without a prescription,” said Anthony Tassone, the national vice president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, which represents over 5,900 community pharmacies nationwide. Fears of a growing black market Australia’s Greens Party had pushed for the amendments to allow adults to buy vapes without a prescription because they do not support prohibition or the criminalization of vaping. “The prohibition of drugs has failed. The Greens are pleased that we have secured amendments to this legislation that will ensure that no person will be criminalised for personal possession of a vaping product,” Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John said in a statement.

      FDA sign-off on menthol e-cigarettes ‘flies in the face of public health,’ anti-tobacco groups say It’s not a criminal offense to possess vapes for personal use, but the import and sale of commercial quantities of vapes will attract large fines. Some fear the new laws will create a black market for vapes, much like one that exists for cigarettes in Australia, which imposes some of the highest tobacco taxes in the world. A box of 20 cigarettes costs around 35 Australian dollars ($23) – considerably more than in the United States and the United Kingdom. And the costs are expected to rise when the tobacco tax increases by another 5% in September. Despite the rising cost of cigarettes, some fear that young vapers – having been locked out of the vape market – will turn to cigarettes to get their nicotine fix. “The reality at the moment is that vapes are actually still cheaper, but with the change in legislation that uncertainty, may be making them think, ‘Well, I won’t be able to get it. Maybe I’ll move back to smoking, or maybe I’ll start smoking,’” Hester Wilson, an addiction expert at the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners told national broadcaster, the ABC. Other countries are grappling with a rise in young people taking up vaping, but they’re adopting various approaches to the issue. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products, drawing harsh criticism from pediatricians and anti-tobacco groups. The FDA also paired with the Justice Department to create a task force to identify and target illegal sales and distribution of e-cigarettes in the US.",,0.2297181338071823
"Canberra, Australia — Good luck getting a late-morning McMuffin in Australia. McDonald’s has cut breakfast service timings by 90 minutes, the company said, after a shortage of eggs caused by bird flu outbreaks that have led to the slaughter of about 1.5 million chickens. “Like many retailers, we are carefully managing supply of eggs due to current industry challenges,” McDonald’s said on Facebook, adding that from Tuesday it would stop serving breakfast at 10:30 a.m. instead of the usual time of midday. “We are working hard with our Aussie farmers and suppliers to return this back to normal as soon as possible,” the fast food company said. Australia is battling outbreaks of several strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza that have struck 11 poultry facilities, most of them egg farms, in its southeast since May. None of the strains are the H5N1 variant of bird flu that has spread through bird and mammal populations worldwide, infecting billions of animals and a small number of humans. Fewer than 10% of Australia’s egg-laying hens have been affected and authorities say they are successfully containing the virus, but several retailers have set limits on the number of eggs customers may buy. There has been some disruption to egg supply, with shelves in some stores emptying toward the end of the day, Rowan McMonnies, the managing director of industry body Australian Eggs, said last week. “Consumers can be assured there’s still over 20 million hens under the care of hundreds of egg farmers across Australia that will continue to work hard to ensure there’s eggs on shelves,” he added.

"Japan became the first country to qualify for the 2026 men’s World Cup after it beat Bahrain 2-0 at Saitama Stadium on Thursday. Second-half goals from Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo were enough for the Samurai Blue to earn its spot at next year’s tournament which is being hosted in the US, Canada and Mexico. Japan becomes the first non-host nation to qualify for the 2026 men’s World Cup, with the three host countries already assured a spot in the 48-team tournament. “Thanks to the players for their efforts and the fans for their support,” Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu said afterwards, per the Associated Press. “We knew that if we persevered that the goals would come. We will try and win our three remaining games and grow as a team.” Despite being on top for the first half in Saitama, Japan was unable to find the breakthrough against a resolute Bahrain team. But in the 66th minute, Kamada – who had earlier come off the bench – slotted home to break the deadlock. And three minutes from time, Kubo – who had looked dangerous down Japan’s left side throughout the match – finished from a tight angle to assure the team of victory. The win maintains Japan’s unbeaten 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign with 19 points from seven games, nine points ahead of second-placed Australia and 10 points ahead of third-placed Saudi Arabia. Japan’s large lead atop Group C of the Asian qualifying route sees the team reach its eighth straight World Cup. In the Asian qualifying format, the top two from each of the six-team groups automatically reach the World Cup while the third and fourth place teams must go through another round of matches for two more spots.

"A remarkable Early Jurassic record has been hiding in plain sight for 20 years on a slab of rock displayed at a high school in Biloela, Australia, according to a new study. While researchers knew the 1.5-meter-long (about 5-foot-long) slab was around 200 million years old and home to an abundance of visible dinosaur footprints, the significance of the fossil remained unclear. Now, a team of paleontologists studying the rock’s surface has found 66 fossilized footprints from 47 individual dinosaurs belonging to the ichnospecies Anomoepus scambus. Ichnospecies are organisms identified only through trace fossils, or fossils that are of impressions they leave, such as footprints, rather than the actual organisms. The discovery represents one of the highest concentrations of dinosaur footprints per square meter ever documented in the country, and it provides an “unprecedented snapshot” of the abundance of dinosaurs during the Early Jurassic, a period during which no dinosaur bones have been uncovered in Australia, according to a news release from The University of Queensland. The findings were published in the journal Historical Biology on March 10. The fact that this fossil slipped under the radar for decades isn’t surprising, said lead study author Dr. Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist and research associate with the university’s Dinosaur Lab. “Fossil dinosaur footprints tend to be vastly under-rated even by many (paleontologists),” Romilio said in an email. But in Australia, since the oldest fossilized dinosaur bones come from the Middle Jurassic, about 160 million years ago, “footprint fossils are the only direct evidence our country has of the types of dinosaurs we had here (during earlier times),” Romilio said. What’s more, the slab provides a rare glimpse into the behavior and activity of a dinosaur that has only been described by its footprints found in various parts of the world, experts say. By using advanced 3D imaging and light filters, Romilio was able to uncover hidden details in the stone slab, revealing the multitude of footprints and other features such as the direction in which the animals that made the tracks were headed. The 66 fossilized footprints, which range in size from about 5 centimeters to 20 centimeters (about 2 to 8 inches) in length, reveal that the dinosaurs had likely been crossing a river or going up and down the length of a river, Romilio said. Since there are no ripple marks on the surface of the rock, it is difficult to tell the river flow’s direction, but the tracks clearly show the dinosaurs walking in two directions, he added.

      Cave discovery reveals previously unknown prehistoric human population in Europe Through his analysis, Romilio found a total of 13 sequences of footprints that belonged to 13 dinosaurs that made the trackways. The remaining footprints, coming to a total of 34, were classified as isolated footprints, accounting for the 47 total individuals. The dinosaurs that made the tracks would have had legs ranging from 15 to 50 centimeters (about 6 to 20 inches) in length along with a chunky body and short arms, Romilio said. Although trace fossils are often overlooked because they are more common than dinosaur bones, they can “provide a huge amount of information when they’re properly analyzed,” said Dr. Paul Olsen, a paleontologist and Arthur D. Storke Memorial Professor of Earth & Environmental Sciences at Columbia University. Olsen, who has studied Anomoepus, was not involved with this new study. “(Footprints) provide information about animals that were present even though we don’t have the bones … They’re really like a parallel dataset that allows us to track, pun intended, what’s going on when the bones are rare. That’s why they’re so important,” Olsen said. Related article
      An apex carnivore was ‘king of the ancient Egyptian forest’ then mysteriously went extinct. A fossil could offer clues From what is known about the other tracks that have been found across parts of the US, Europe, Africa and China, A. scambus was a three-toed, two-legged dinosaur that belonged to the ornithischian family, which includes other plant-eating dinosaurs such as duckbills and triceratops, and had beaks at the front of their mouths with grinding teeth, Olsen said. These new footprints, which preserve a lot of anatomical detail, further support that “small ornithischian dinosaurs achieved a global distribution by the beginning of the Jurassic Period,” he added. The study authors also analyzed two other instances of trace fossils that were found in unexpected locations. They found that a 2,000-kilogram (about 4,400-pound) boulder used as a parking lot entry marker at the Callide mine near Biloela had two distinct footprints left by a slightly larger dinosaur. And a third rock from a personal collection (in use as a bookend) had a single footprint. The rock slab located at the high school was also originally from the Callide Mine, which is an open-cut mine, meaning that the overlying rock is removed to get to the coal underneath, Romilio explained. During the extraction of the overlying rock, which spans many miles and dates to the Early Jurassic period, fossil footprints such as these can be found. “There are definitely many more fossils occurring there,” Romilio said. “Whether they are spotted in time, or whether it is safe to pick them up is another thing entirely. We are just lucky that these and some others have been spotted, recovered and available for people like me to study them and share the findings.”",,0.21324564516544342
"Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action. In late November, a gaggle of open-water swimmers set out from Sydney’s Bondi Beach. About 500 meters (1,600 feet) from shore, they stopped and formed a line 150 meters (about 500 feet) long, treading water above the length of the beach’s shark net. They hoped to demonstrate that the length of the net paled in comparison to that of the world-famous kilometer-long beach. And that if they could easily bypass the net, sharks can too. “It’s a bit of a joke for us when we swim over the top of or around the outside of the shark nets … seeing how utterly useless they are,” Kim Miller, an open-water swimmer based in Sydney, told CNN. Miller was out of town the day of the protest, but she’s among a growing group of swimmers, surfers, animal welfare advocates, and others vocally opposed to shark nets, which have been used at Sydney’s beaches every summer since 1937. Opponents of the nets – which are installed at 51 beaches between Newcastle and Wollongong – argue they are ineffective, outdated, and harmful to the ocean ecosystem. They say nets provide swimmers with a false sense of security. Some academic studies back up claims that the nets are not effective at keeping people safe. From September 2023 to April 2024, 255 marine creatures were entangled in shark nets in New South Wales (NSW). But only 15 of those animals were “target species” like great white, tiger and bull sharks. The rest were rays, turtles, dolphins, fish like longtail tuna, and sharks not considered dangerous. Marcel Green, the leader of the shark program at the NSW Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD), which manages the nets, told CNN via email that whale alarms and dolphin pingers are used to deter those animals from the nets, and that nets aren’t used during the winter, because it’s the peak of the whale migration season. This year, amid growing opposition to the nets, they were removed on March 31, a month earlier than normal, due to increased turtle activity in April. And in recent months, in response to a survey sent out by the NSW government, asking local authorities to vote on the use of shark nets, none of the eight councils where shark nets are used elected to continue their use next season, according to Humane World for Animals. Now, the state government is set to decide if shark nets have a future in NSW. Politics over nets Going to the beach is a popular pastime in Australia, where almost 90% of the population lives within 50 kilometers (30 miles) of the coast. The country’s shoreline is also home to several species of sharks, including tiger, bull, and great white sharks, that are most frequently involved in serious injuries to humans. NSW has a comprehensive shark management program to try to keep beachgoers safe. In addition to nets, authorities use technologies like SMART drumlines, which consist of a buoy and a baited hook. When an animal is caught, authorities are alerted. Non-target animals are released, and sharks of target species are tagged and released farther out to sea. Later, if a tagged shark swims close to shore, the public is alerted via an app and updates to an X account. Drone patrols are also a common sight over the state’s beaches. “If we know that we have more sophisticated measures that are better at protecting sharks, they don’t kill non-target species, so why would we keep the nets in that mix?” Jack Boyd, the mayor of Sutherland Shire council, one of the councils that participated in the survey, told CNN. “It’s not something that we considered flippantly, it’s not something that’s a response to special interests,” he added. “It is something that is based on science.” Over the last 10 years there were, on average, 2.8 annual fatalities from shark incidents ﻿nationally, 20 cases a year where people were injured, and seven a year where the person was uninjured, according to the Taronga Conservation Society Australia, which works on the Australian Shark-Incident Database. For comparison, in 2023, 125 people drowned in the ocean, according to Surf Life Saving Australia, and there were 1,266 fatalities on Australian roads over the same period, according to official data. Since the meshing program began in 1937, there has only been one fatal shark incident at a netted beach, and that was back in 1951, says Green, of NSW DPIRD. He points to a 1997 study that says when they were first introduced, shark nets in NSW, Queensland and South Africa reduced the rate of shark incidents by about 90%. He added that to date, there has not been a shark bite while drones have been monitoring a beach. (Officials have been trialing the use of drones to detect sharks at NSW beaches since 2017). According to some experts, shark nets have become a political hot potato. “I do not see anyone concerned with the safety of swimmers and surfers. I see people concerned with the next election and with political survival,” Christopher Pepin-Neff, an associate professor in Public Policy at the University of Sydney, told CNN. The tensions over the future of shark nets were on full display in late February at a local council meeting in Randwick, home to Coogee, another popular Sydney beach, just a few kilometers south of Bondi. “They do not form a barrier, deter, deflect, or stop sharks from swimming at beaches,” Lauren Sandeman, a PhD researcher in human and shark interactions, told the council. “Their goal is to entangle and kill whatever swims into the net.” For others, the risk of changing tack is too great. “If these shark nets were removed and some person is getting mauled by a shark and being killed, I couldn’t face that person’s partner or parent,” said councilor Noel D’Souza, before casting his vote to keep the nets in the water. Another councilor, Carolyn Martin, who supported the nets told CNN that although it was a tough decision for her personally, her community “just felt safer with the nets in.” In the end, eight councilors voted to do away with shark nets, beating out the seven councilors who want them to stay. Saving Norman The population of grey nurse sharks on Australia’s East coast has dwindled to about 2,000 animals making them critically endangered. The sharks, which can grow over to over three meters (almost 10 feet) in length and have long, scraggly teeth visible even when their mouths are closed, are not considered a threat to divers and swimmers. “They have this ferocious look about them, and yet they’re these cute, cuddly Labradors,” says Sarah Han-de-Beaux, a Sydney-based free- and scuba diver, who frequently spots the sharks on her outings. Several years ago, Han-de-Beaux and others started “Saving Norman,” a campaign to advocate for the removal of the nets. (Many Sydney residents refer to grey nurse sharks as “Norman,” a name coined by a local drone photographer). In recent months, she’s given up most of her weekends to campaign for the removal of the nets, manning booths at local beaches to educate the public. “People think they stretch the whole beach,” she says, but all shark nets in NSW span 150 meters (about 500 feet) and are just six meters tall. Han-de-Beaux says that it’s been a year of progress. This summer, the frequency of net inspections went up to every two days from every three days, to increase the possibility of releasing entangled animals alive. (The previous summer, only 36% of the 255 creatures caught in the nets were released alive). Other measures to protect accidental catch, like installing lights on the nets to deter turtles, were trialed. And in recent weeks, local officials have been posting signs warning the public of the early removal of the nets. Now, a decision is expected from the New South Wales government on if the nets will go back in next September. Pepin-Neff estimates that the decision might be clear when the next state budget is announced, generally around June. The government will consider feedback from the surveys it sent out to coastal councils, and other data as it develops its shark management program for the 2025 to 2026 season, according to Green. “Our program is evidence-based after many years of trials and research,” he added. In the meantime, swimmers like Miller plan to keep taking to the water, nets or not, accepting the risk of entering a shark’s natural habitat. “Every time I get in the ocean, I assume that there are sharks in there. It’s where they live,” she says. “We’d have to be super unlucky for something to go terribly wrong.”",,0.2132110297679901
"Russian-born tennis player Daria Kasatkina said that she “didn’t have much choice” about the decision to compete for Australia due to her sexuality. Kasatkina is preparing to play under a new flag for the first time at the Charleston Open after announcing last week that her application for permanent residency in Australia had been accepted. In recent years, she has been living in Spain and Dubai while competing as a neutral athlete amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Related article
      After her breast cancer diagnosis, Gaby Dabrowski found unexpected ‘joy’ – and success – on the tennis court “With everything going on in my previous country, I didn’t have much choice,” Kasatkina said about choosing to switch nationality, per Reuters. “For me, being openly gay, if I want to be myself, I have to make this step, and I did it.” Kasatkina, currently ranked 12th in the world, came out as gay in July 2022 and is in a relationship with figure skater Natalia Zabiiako. Though same-sex relationships were decriminalized in Russia in 1993, the tides have recently shifted. In 2013, the country passed a “gay propaganda” law, which has been used to target the LGBTQ community, according to The Council for Global Equality. President Vladimir Putin then signed a bill broadening the scope of the 2013 law in December 2022, making it illegal for anyone to promote same-sex relationships or suggest that non-heterosexual orientations are “normal.” The ILGA-Europe, an organization working for LGBTQ rights in Europe, ranks Russia as the worst country in Europe for LGBTQ people, behind Turkey and Azerbaijan. Kasatkina wrote on Instagram last week that she now plans to live in Melbourne, adding that Australia “is a place I love, is incredibly welcoming and a place where I feel totally at home.” Ahead of her second-round match against American Lauren Davis in Charleston, South Carolina, the 27-year-old said: “Honestly, it feels different, I’m not going to lie. It’s emotional for me. I have to get used to it. But I’m really happy to start this new chapter of my life representing Australia on the big stage.” ‘Stressful’ going on court as an Aussie for first time, Kasatkina says Kasatkina, in her first match representing Australia, defeated Davis 6-1, 6-1. And while the scoreline might have made her win look easy, Kasatkina did not see it that way. “Going on court today as an Aussie this time was stressful, honestly,” Kasatkina said in an interview on the Tennis Channel set. “This week in general was a bit stressful, let’s say, with all the changes and with all the feedback and stuff. “When the tennis player steps on court, all the stress (she) is living through explodes. That’s how it works. (I’m) really happy how I handled that situation today, because it was not easy, honestly.” Kasatkina also shared in her interview that she was watching a Tennis Channel broadcast on Tuesday, and when the Wednesday schedule flashed up on the screen – with an Australian flag next to her name – her reaction, she said, was “Oh my God!” “It’s a really special moment for me to win the first match as an Australian player,” Kasatkina said. “I’m just really happy with that, and I couldn’t believe one day something like that would happen to me.” This story has been updated with additional comments from Kasatkina.",,0.34403103590011597
"Australian sprinter Gout Gout, 17, broke the 10-second barrier for the 100 meters not once, but twice in the same day. The teenager, who had never dipped under the mark before, clocked 9.99 seconds in the under-20 100m heat before recording the same time in the final at the Australian Athletics Championships in Perth on Thursday. However, neither time will count as his official personal best as both were assisted by illegally high tailwinds. Going under 10 seconds for the first time is the latest achievement in Gout’s promising young career, which began getting global attention after he ran the 100m in 10.57 seconds as a 14-year-old in 2022. Related article
      17-year-old sprint sensation Gout Gout is the ‘next best thing,’ says Olympic champion Letsile Tebogo He has already drawn comparisons with legendary sprinter Usain Bolt and is considered one of the fastest teenagers in the world. On Thursday, Gout initially blitzed through the heats, easing up over the finish line to save his energy for the final, where he clocked the exact same time. He didn’t have the best start in the final but quickly raced away from his rivals. This time the teenager didn’t ease up and continued to push before dipping over the line. His time in the heat was assisted by a 3.5m/s tailwind, while his final time was aided by a 2.6m/s tailwind. “That’s what I was hoping for. I didn’t get the start I anticipated but I just focused on what I needed to focus on, got through my drive phase and kept driving and saw the clock, so can’t be happier than that,” Gout said after the race when asked about breaking the 10-second barrier. Gout has enjoyed some hot form this year, running a world-leading time of 20.05 seconds in the 200m in March, just 0.01 outside his own Australian record which he set in December. He then followed it up by becoming the first-ever Australian to break the 20-second barrier for 200m, running 19.98 seconds in the Queensland State Championships. However, the time also won’t stand as an official record because of illegal wind conditions (+3.6m/s). The speedy times have thrown Gout’s name into the limelight and he’s been touted as the heir to Bolt’s throne. For Gout, though, it’s all about taking things one step at a time. “Obviously there are those moments when the media gets too much but, at this moment, I just let it sink in and focus on training, focus on my race and get the job done,” he said. Gout will be back at the same track to race in the men’s 200m event on Sunday when he will look to record a new personal best.",,0.2920195460319519
"Model Lucy Markovic, who rose to fame on “Australia’s Next Top Model” and later walked runways for the likes of Armani and Versace, has died age 27. Her agency, Elite Model Management, announced her death via social media on Thursday, saying she had been battling a rare brain condition. A message confirming her death was also posted to Markovic’s official Instagram stories, just hours after a post announced she was “battling for her life.” Elite Model Management’s statement went on to call Markovic “a bright shining light,” adding: “Modeling was one of Lucy’s dreams, and we are deeply honored to have been part of that journey with her,” it continued. “She brought elegance, strength, and beauty to her work. But more than that, she brought herself — her warmth, her laughter, her light.” Markovic was a teenager when she competed on the ninth season of “Australia’s Next Top Model,” a show based on Tyra Banks’ “America’s Next Top Model,” in 2015. She finished runner up, losing out in the final to Brittany Beattie. She went on to forge a successful modeling career, appearing in campaigns for brands like Versace and Victoria Beckham, and walking catwalks for Oscar de la Renta, Bulgari, Givenchy and Dolce & Gabbana, among others. She also appeared in high-profile magazines including Marie Claire and various international editions of Vogue. Three weeks ago, Markovic announced on Instagram she would be undergoing surgery for a brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a tangle of blood vessels that can lead to brain damage and stroke. She described the malformation as “the size of a golf ball” and said she had experienced seizures. The post revealed she had battled the condition for four years. It featured a photo of herself in hospital, along with an image of a brain scan. “Full flood of emotions in this time,” she had written in the caption. “Life’s a journey and I’m ready for the next chapter.” Tributes flooded in from across the fashion world on Thursday, with newly crowned Model of the Year Alex Consani among those leaving messages for Markovic on her Instagram account. Fashion icon Donatella Versace, who now serves as Versace’s chief brand ambassador, also used the platform to pay tribute to Markovic. “I am so sorry to hear the news about @lucymarkovicc,” wrote Versace, who last month stepped down as her family label’s chief creative officer after 28 years. “Rest in peace beautiful girl.” Markovic’s Australian agency, Kult Australia, meanwhile wrote: “Today, we lost a star… She was radiant, warm and a beautiful soul.”",,0.2933775782585144
"(CNN) –– President Donald Trump’s US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Tuesday defended the administration’s expansive tariffs, saying that its concerns would not be resolved overnight, and in at least one case, the tariffs were about “running up the score.” Greer’s comments came during a routine hearing with the Senate Finance Committee, which happened in the wake of the stock market’s mass selloff triggered by Trump’s sweeping tariff plan. Starting Wednesday all countries’ goods will be subject to a minimum 10% tariff, with rates much higher for 60 countries the administration deems the “worst offenders” in terms of trade barriers. Greer affirmed that those tariffs will go into effect on Wednesday and said that he’s not concerned with the stock market’s turmoil, which has amounted to trillions of dollars in market value wiped out in just a few days. “I know everyone’s concerned about Wall Street. I’m just concerned about Main Street,” he said. “Our large and persistent trade deficit has been over 30 years in the making, and it will not be resolved overnight,” Greer told the Senate Finance Committee during a routine hearing. “But all of this is in the right direction, particularly as we start to negotiate with these countries.” Greer said the president’s “strategy is already bearing fruit” and that nearly “50 countries have approached me to discuss the President’s new policy and explore how to achieve reciprocity.” He added that “many” of them have signaled that they don’t plan to retaliate against the United States. During the hearing Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the Democratic ranking member of the committee, decried Trump’s sweeping tariffs and said he is introducing a new resolution “to end the latest crop of global tariffs that are clobbering American families and small businesses.” “The Trump aimless, chaotic tariff spree has proven beyond a doubt that Congress has given far too much of our constitutional power on international trade over to the executive branch,” Wyden said. “It is time to take that power back.” Non-trade barriers take the spotlight Throughout the hearing, Greer pointed to the prominent role that so-called non-trade barriers are playing in Trump’s trade policy, one of them being foreign countries’ regulations that he said are rooted in “fake science.” Greer told the committee that India has stringent restrictions around imports, which he claimed are based on “fake science” and are being used “to block our imports.” He also pointed to Australia having “barriers to the export of beef from the United States.” American beef is not officially banned in Australia, but the Australian Bureau of Statistics says that none has been imported into the country since 2005. “And it’s not just beef,” Greer said. “Australia also blocks on… fake science grounds the export of fresh and frozen US pork, so it’s incredible that they do this. We have zero exports of the fresh and frozen US pork to Australia.” The US Department of Agriculture last year said that “the US has reestablished itself as Australia’s primary source of pork imports in the first half of 2024.” In a contentious exchange with Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, Greer said that new tariffs on Australia are warranted despite the country having a $17.9 billion trade surplus with the US, as of 2024. He said “that tariffs on Australia are necessary because “we’re addressing the $1.2 trillion deficit, the largest in human history that President Biden left us with, we should be running up the score in Australia.” Australia and the US have a free trade agreement in place, but “despite the agreement, they ban our beef, they ban our pork,” Greer said. Warner said that “the lack of trust from friends and allies based upon this ridiculous policy that goes into full effect at midnight tonight is extraordinary.” Meanwhile, some Republicans, such as Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, praised the administration’s focus on addressing non-tariff barriers. Several Democrats throughout the hearing mentioned the stock market’s decline after Trump announced his tariffs last week. Greer said he’s not concerned about that. Stocks regained some ground Tuesday morning, after they plummeted in the prior three trading sessions. Those declines wiped out trillions in just a few days.",,0.23945216834545135
"Kirsty Coventry has been elected as the 10th President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), becoming the first woman and African to ever be elected to the position. Coventry, 41, will also be the youngest ever to assume the role and came through a field of seven contenders in the seaside resort of Costa Navarino in Greece to land the most powerful job in world sport. Coventry will officially take up the role on June 24, after incumbent Thomas Bach steps down following a 12-year spell in charge. Related article
      From geopolitical Jenga to gender politics: The challenges facing the next IOC President Coventry will arrive at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty around the globe, question marks over the direction of the Olympic movement in the 21st century, and more scrutiny than ever on issues concerning gender identity and equality, among others. “This is an extraordinary moment. As an nine-year girl, I never thought I would be standing up here one day getting to give back to this incredible movement of ours,” Coventry said after her election. Before becoming a member of the IOC, she was a standout athlete for Zimbabwe. Coventry has won seven of the country’s eight Olympic medals to date. At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, she won three medals, including gold in the 200m backstroke before successfully defending her title four years later. The first round of voting on Thursday in Greece didn’t proceed without issues though, with numerous voters complaining about problems with their technological voting systems. At one point, IOC director general Christophe De Kepper – who was hosting the voting – humorously said that a member was “testing his patience” with his complaints. To the surprise of many, the voting was quickly closed after the first round with a winner already reaching the absolute majority (50% + one vote) mark needed. And after a 30-minute break, Coventry was announced as Bach’s replacement and the 10th president of the IOC; of the 97 votes, Coventry received 49, while second-placed Juan Antonio Samaranch got 28. “This is not just a huge honor, but it’s also a reminder of my commitment to every single one of you that I will lead this organization with so much pride with the values at the core and I will make all of you very, very proud and extremely confident in the decision that you’ve taken today,” Coventry said. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart, and now, we’ve got some work together. This race was an incredible race and it made us better, made us a stronger movement.” Coventry’s first major event to oversee will be the Milan-Cortina Winter Games next year in Italy, with the Opening Ceremony less than 11 months away. In her manifesto for the IOC presidency, Coventry stated she hopes to make sport “a bridge between countries and cultures, a source of hope and a force for good.” She also stressed her commitment to addressing inequality in sports, “which also means strengthening women’s sports by protecting female athletes and promoting equal opportunities for women at all levels of our movement.” This story has been updated with additional information.",,0.2799072265625

"A major Australian IVF clinic has apologized for giving the wrong embryo to a woman who then gave birth to another couple’s baby, blaming the mix-up on “human error.” Monash IVF, which operates more than 100 clinics across Australia, said in a statement staff were “devastated” by the mistake, believed to be the first of its kind in the country. “On behalf of Monash IVF, I want to say how truly sorry I am for what has happened,” said CEO Michael Knaap in the statement. “We will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.” Monash IVF has not named the couples involved, nor has it responded to questions about when the baby was born, or who has custody of the child, out of respect for the couples’ privacy. The error occurred at Monash IVF’s Brisbane clinic, in the state of Queensland, where the law recognizes the birth mother and her partner as the child’s legal parents. It’s not clear whether either of the couples suspected a mix-up before the clinic discovered the error. Alex Polyakov, a clinical associate professor at the University of Melbourne and a fertility consultant at Melbourne’s Royal Women’s Hospital, said it was the first incident of its kind in four decades of IVF in Australia. “Australia’s regulatory framework for assisted reproductive technology is internationally recognized for its stringency and thoroughness,” he said in written comments. “The probability of such an event occurring is so low that it defies statistical quantification.” How did it happen? The mistake was discovered in February after the birth parents requested to transfer their remaining embryos to another IVF provider. After an extra embryo was found in their storage compartment, an internal inquiry discovered they’d received the wrong embryo. It’s not clear how the error was made but according to the Monash IVF statement, another patient’s embryo was “incorrectly thawed and transferred to the birth parents.” Knaap, the company’s CEO, said he was confident it was “an isolated incident.” “We are reinforcing all our safeguards across our clinics – we also commissioned an independent investigation and are committed to implementing its recommendations in full,” he added. Sarah Jefford, an Australian lawyer who deals exclusively in surrogacy, donor conception and co-parenting, said she had received calls from clients worried about their own IVF treatment. “We do not have legal precedence for this in Australia,” she said. “Our laws presume that the birth parents are the legal parents of a child, however this is open to challenge when the genetic parents did not consent to their embryo being used.” She said any decision about the child’s future will be based on their best interests, but the ramifications will be “lifelong for everyone involved.” Related article
      About 2% of babies born in the US are from IVF. Here’s what you need to know about it The Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) said in a statement that it was “aware of the serious incident,” and its immediate thoughts were with the families affected. It said such incidents are rare and require “the highest standards of transparency.” Similar errors have been made in the United States, including a recent case where a White woman discovered she’d been given the wrong embryo after giving birth to a Black infant. This is not the first time Monash IVF has been accused of wrongdoing. Last year, the company agreed to pay 56 million Australian dollars ($35 million) to settle a class action suit brought by 700 former patients. The patients alleged the company didn’t disclose the risk of false positives in genetic testing on embryos, which led them to discard potentially viable embryos.

"A member of a small South African research team at a remote Antarctic base has accused a colleague of assault and pleaded for intervention, officials have said. A “response plan to engage the individuals involved” was “immediately activated,” officials from South Africa’s Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE), which supervises the base, said in a statement – but added that they had no plans to bring any of the team back home. In the statement sent to CNN, in response to allegations made in an email from the research team, the DFFE said, “The alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse, and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended.” The DFFE said it received complaints of alleged assault involving two members of the overwintering team of nine on February 27 and was further investigating an allegation of sexual harassment. The department did not mention the names of those involved. The intervention was revealed after a report from South Africa’s Sunday Times newspaper detailed an email from the team that accused the man of attacking its leader and pleaded for help. “His behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,” the author wrote in the email, according to the Sunday Times, adding: “I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.” No names were disclosed by the newspaper.

Its Antarctic station known as SANAE IV typically houses a team of scientists for 13 months, the DFFE said, adding that the current group was dispatched on February 1. “The Department confirms that there were no incidents that required any of the nine overwintering team members to be brought back to Cape Town,” its statement said about the assault allegations. “If such incidents occurred, the management team of the Department would have replaced such an overwintering team member with immediate effect.” This is not the first case of assault involving a South African expedition team. In 2017, at a research base in the remote Marion Island, a research team member was reported to have “vandalized another colleague’s laptop with an axe because of a love triangle they were involved in,” according to a South African parliamentary monitoring group. The DPPE explained that members of its research missions are evaluated ahead of expeditions “to ensure they are able to cope with the isolation and can work and live with others in the confined space of the bases.” However, it added, “it is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required.”",,0.2509787082672119
"Sudan’s army has reclaimed the Presidential Palace in the capital, Khartoum, in a significant victory over a rampaging militia that controls swaths of the war-torn country. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have viciously scrambled for territory since fighting broke out between them in April 2023. The conflict has triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and has left more than 28,000 people dead with 11 million others forced to flee their homes, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data initiative. The RSF has laid siege to Khartoum and the Sudanese seat of power since the start of the war. On Friday, the government said its troops had seized control of the Presidential Palace and would continue its push to retake the capital. “Today the flag is raised, the palace is back, and the journey continues until victory is complete,” information minister Khalid Al-Aiser wrote on X. The Sudanese justice ministry hailed the “liberation of the Republican Palace,” describing it as “a symbol of national sovereignty.” Activist Hala Al-Karib told CNN that the recapture of the palace was crucial for the military and also for people displaced by the conflict. “It is quite significant for SAF and central and north Sudanese possibilities of IDPs return,” she said, adding that some questions, however, remained answered. “The question of Sudan’s governance and to what extent SAF is open to a political process with RSF and other political actors or continues with the war remains a question.” Photos of government troops celebrating at the palace were shared on social media by the military. “Our forces … completely destroyed the enemy’s personnel and equipment and seized large quantities of its equipment and weapons,” a military spokesperson said Friday morning in a televised broadcast. Later on Friday, the RSF said in a Telegram post that “the battle for the Republican Palace is not over yet,” adding that its forces “are still present in the vicinity of the area” and had “carried out a swift military operation targeting a gathering … inside the Republican Palace, killing more than 89 enemy personnel and destroying various military vehicles.” Local media reported that the palace was hit by a drone, killing an unknown number of soldiers, as well as journalists from the state broadcaster. Parts of Khartoum are still held by the RSF militia which controls the country’s western, southern and central regions, including Darfur where ethnically motivated killings are common. The SAF administers the eastern and northern parts of the country. Related article
      Infants and young children are being raped as a weapon of war in Sudan, UNICEF says Retaking Khartoum would be symbolic for the SAF whose rival the RSF had begun steps to establish a parallel government. But it would also come at a great cost for the Sudanese people as civilians are often caught in the crossfire. “Dozens of civilians, including local humanitarian volunteers, have been killed by artillery shelling and aerial bombardment by the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces in eastern Khartoum and north Omdurman since 12 March,” a spokesperson for the United Nations Human Rights Office, Seif Magango, said Thursday as fighting intensified in the capital. Sudan’s warring parties have each been accused of war crimes. In January, the United States accused the RSF of committing genocide, the second in the country in two decades. This month, a new report from UNICEF also linked the SAF to atrocities that included sexual violence against young children, some as young as one. “Credible reports indicate that the RSF and allied militia have raided homes in eastern Khartoum, carrying out summary killings and arbitrary detentions, and looted food and medical supplies from community kitchens and medical clinics,” Magango added. “SAF and affiliated fighters are also reported to have engaged in looting and other criminal activities in areas they control in Khartoum North (Bahri) and East Nile. Widespread arbitrary arrests are ongoing in East Nile.”",,0.26393386721611023
"It’s the most powerful position in world sport with high stakes, high expectations and high consequences. Its occupant holds huge sway in shaping the global sporting landscape and narrative, wields extraordinary political clout, and presides over a multi-billion-dollar budget. On Thursday, Kirsty Coventry became the latest occupant to hold this great responsibility when she was elected as the 10th President of International Olympic Committee (IOC), becoming the first woman and African to ever hold this position. Coventry, who will also be the youngest ever to assume the role at age 41, will follow in the footsteps of outgoing President Thomas Bach, who during his 12-year term has overseen one of the most extraordinary periods in the history of the Olympic movement. Coventry – who will officially take the reins in June – will arrive at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty around the globe, question marks over the direction of the Olympic movement in the 21st century, and more scrutiny than ever on issues concerning gender identity and equality, among others. Russia reintegration With less than a year to go until the 2026 Winter Games in Milan-Cortina, one of the first items on the agenda will be whether and how to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes back into the Olympic fold Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the IOC imposed a blanket ban on athletes from both countries from participating in its events. Just over a year later, though, the organization approved allowing said athletes to take part in international sports tournaments as neutrals in March 2023, provided they met strict eligibility criteria. Related article
      Can Russians and Belarusians compete at the Paris Olympics? Individual Neutral Athletes explained In total, 32 athletes – 17 Russian and 15 Belarusian passport holders – ended up accepting the IOC’s invitation to compete under the Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) flag at last year’s Paris Games. Bach recently told CNN Sports that any decision moving forward should continue to be made with the best interests of the athletes and not their nationality or ongoing geopolitical events in mind. “It’s not about Russia. It is about the athletes. Everybody who is following the rules has to have the right to participate in the Olympic Games, full stop,” he told CNN Sports’ Amanda Davies. Russia has already said it will fight for its participation in 2026, while Ukraine has urged the Olympic movement to hold firm and keep Russian and Belarusian athletes at bay. With qualification events already underway for next year’s showpiece event and the war in Ukraine still rumbling on, time will be of the essence. Trump presidency Then there is navigating the contentious and unpredictable Trump administration in the lead up to the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles. While Bach has played up the relationship between the IOC and President Donald Trump and his hopes that LA will “expose the US as a sports-loving country,” the US president’s direct, disruptive style of leadership may severely test that resolve. Trump, perhaps more than any other world leader in Games gone by, will want to put his own stamp on proceedings. As the host nation’s head of state, he will likely help formally open the Summer Olympics on July 14, 2028. “Donald Trump becomes the single most important player, the single most important figure outside of the Olympic movement,” said CNN Sports analyst Christine Brennan. “This is a man who loves sports and wants to insert himself in sports every way he can. “I see him being a huge force within that, and I also see him being a very disruptive force within that.” Trump has already warned that visas could be denied to LA-bound competitors based on their nationality and who don’t meet the administration’s gender interpretations, among others. With teams having already been denied entry into the US and relations having soured in recent months between the US and some of its long-time allies, the two-time gold medal-winning Olympic swimmer will need to tread a fine line between maintaining the IOC’s principles of neutrality and universality, while also providing a pragmatic approach to ensure all 206 National Olympic Committees, plus the Refugee Olympic Team, are all present at the Athlete’s Village. DSD and transgender rules As it stands, there is currently no clear, unified approach or framework between the IOC and its International Federations (IFs) regarding the participation of athletes with differences in sex development (DSD) and transgender athletes from the local through to the national and global stage. IFs have been able to decide their own participation rules – based on fairness, inclusion and scientific evidence – following a revised framework put in place by the IOC in November 2021. Some IFs, like World Athletics, have subsequently adopted tighter regulations with stricter thresholds or additional requirements for DSD athletes, while others, like World Rugby, have taken a stronger position in banning transgender athletes from competing in elite women’s competitions, citing competitive advantage and safety concerns, among others.

      An Olympic dream crushed, an elite career derailed. These women were barred from competing because of the way they were born The lack of universal rules has been criticized for creating confusion among athletes and stakeholders. This was especially evident during last summer’s Paris Games when boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting became the targets of misinformation about their gender, triggering an onslaught of online, transphobic abuse toward athletes “It’s a phenomenon of our world. What does social media do in such cases?” Bach recently told CNN. “You had all sorts of people from all walks of life who were jumping on this without having any idea. We need to dig a little bit deeper how in this world you can really expose the facts and then discuss these facts – and then how to interpret these facts.” Changes made by Coventry, who is currently Zimbabwe’s sports minister, could include the implementation of standardized rules for all sports based on firm scientific evidence, with universal eligibility criteria that will help to simplify policies and subsequently help reduce current confusion. New frontiers Coventry’s eight-year mandate will run all the way through to 2033. All Games in that window have already been picked – even the 2034 Winter Olympics, which will be staged in Salt Lake City. With the next decade secured, attention will turn to the selection of the host for the Summer Games in 2036. It will be the first time a decision has been taken since human rights commitments have been added to the Olympic Charter. Furthermore, the IOC has also modified its selection criteria changing the host from a single city to multiple cities, regions, or countries. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, India and Indonesia, among others, have already all expressed an interest in hosting the Games. While there is no set timetable currently in place for a decision, the expectation is that an announcement won’t be made until after 2025. With climate concerns becoming an increasingly prominent consideration in decision-making, a review of the global sports calendar for both Summer and Winter Games could also be undertaken to allow for more interested parties to bid for the Games. Seoul 1988 and Sydney 2000, for example, hosted the summer edition of the Games in the window between September and October. Aside from taking the Games to new corners of the world, the Olympic movement may also start to see a diversification of sports to cater for a younger, digital-minded audience. With the inaugural Olympic Esports Games being held in Riyadh in 2027, a push for new forms of delivering the Games to audiences around the world in a rapidly changing entertainment-scape could also see the IOC embrace a push for technological transformation, the likes of which it has never seen before.",,0.3438001275062561
"A member of the international force battling gangs in Haiti has been killed, as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio launches a tour of the Caribbean with Haiti’s security crisis high on the agenda. The Kenyan police officer was initially reported missing after suspected gang members ambushed two mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles on Tuesday in Pont-Sondé, a town in the Artibonite region, according to a statement by the Kenya-led Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS). Haiti’s Presidential Transitional Council later confirmed the officer had died, identifying him as Bénédict Kabiru. “This valiant police officer, engaged alongside Haitian forces to fight insecurity, made the ultimate sacrifice for a better future for our country. His bravery and commitment will never be forgotten,” the council said. Related article
      Haiti gang massacre leaves over 180 dead after Voodoo accusations, say UN and rights groups Forces from the MSS and the Haitian National Police earlier carried out a search and rescue operation to locate the officer, Kenya’s National Police Service said. The ambushed vehicles had been dispatched to recover an armored police vehicle that got stuck in a ditch – which MSS said may have been deliberately dug by gangs. During the recovery operation, one of the MRAP vehicles also got stuck and the other developed mechanical issues. As officers attempted to fix the issue, they were suddenly attacked by gang members, the MSS said in a statement. After the attack, videos were shared online purporting to show the officer’s body lying on the ground. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the footage, and has reached out to MSS for more information. His death marks the latest Kenyan casualty since the security mission arrived in June. Last month, another Kenyan member of MSS was fatally wounded in an operation also in the Artibonite region, MSS said. The US has been a key financial supporter of MSS, and the security crisis in Haiti is a focus of Secretary Rubio’s visit to the Caribbean this week. On Wednesday, Rubio is scheduled to meet with the president of Haiti’s Presidential Transitional Council Fritz Jean in Jamaica. The Haitian government said the meeting is meant to strengthen regional cooperation related to its challenges. Over 80% of Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince has been estimated to be under gang control. Since the MSS arrived, gangs have spread increasingly into rural areas, seizing swathes of territory in the agriculturally critical Artibonite region. In October, the United Nations said least 70 people, including women and children, were massacred by the Gran Grif gang in the same Artibonite town where the officer was killed on Tuesday. Violence in Port-au-Prince has led to record levels of displacement, exacerbating humanitarian conditions, UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said during a press briefing on Wednesday. Nearly 23,000 people were displaced in just one week in March, he said. The crisis has also cut into vital supply lines across the country. “Beyond the worrying situation in the capital, almost half of the entire population – that’s 5.5 million human beings – is going hungry, one of the highest proportions in any crisis around the world,” Dujarric said.

"Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action. It’s been 30 years, but Dr. Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka still remembers the first time she ever saw a mountain gorilla. It was the summer of 1994. Deep in the jungle of Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, the then-24-year-old student was hundreds of miles from her home in the country’s capital, Kampala. Bwindi is one of only two places in the world where mountain gorillas live, and after graduating from the Royal Veterinary College in London, Kalema-Zikusoka had her heart set on seeing the great apes. For the first week of her month-long placement, she’d been stuck at base camp with a terrible cold, unable to join the jungle treks, with her frustration and anticipation rising every day. Finally, after what felt like endless waiting, Kalema-Zikusoka was cleared to hike. Pushing through tangled vines and roots in the thick forest, she could hear bubbling waterfalls, birds squawking, and chimpanzees hooting. But gorillas, she says, are silent. “You don’t hear them, but you see their trails as you’re walking,” says Kalema-Zikusoka. “You can be looking for them, thinking will I ever see them? Then suddenly — they’re there. It’s such a magical feeling.” Sitting in a forest clearing was a silverback gorilla, called Kacupira. “When I got to see Kacupira, having wanted to see gorillas for so long — suddenly this gorilla was sitting there chewing on a piece of bark, and I was like, ‘wow,’” recalls Kalema-Zikusoka, now 55. “I looked into his very intelligent brown eyes, and I felt a really deep connection. He was just willing to let us into his presence, and not at all threatening.” After this encounter, Kalema-Zikusoka decided to stay at Bwindi. Her one-month summer placement turned into three decades of conservation work at the park, where she became the nation’s first wildlife veterinarian in 1996. With her help, Bwindi’s gorilla population grew from less than 300 to 459, and the subspecies is no longer critically endangered, according to the IUCN Red List. “The mountain gorillas have really shaped my life,” says Kalema-Zikusoka. And in turn, “the gorillas have really transformed Uganda, and brought Ugandan conservation and tourism back on the map.” A violent history For millennia, mountain gorillas roamed across the forests of Uganda, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But in the last 100 years, rampant deforestation, poaching, and conflicts have left them on the brink of extinction, clinging to just two surviving habitats: Bwindi and the Virungas. In the 1970s, Uganda’s gorillas faced another existential threat. The eight-year dictatorship of Idi Amin — who was known as the “Butcher of Uganda” for his brutality — devastated the country, killing up to 300,000 people, destroying land and resources, and slaughtering much of the nation’s wildlife. Kalema-Zikusoka was just two years old at the time of the military coup, and her father was a minister in the government that was overthrown by Amin. “When Amin came into power, my dad was one of the first victims,” she recalls. “He was abducted when he was taking a relative back home; he was followed by a vehicle, and never seen again.” Growing up in political turmoil, Kalema-Zikusoka found solace with her many household pets: her older siblings often rescued stray cats and dogs, who became her companions, and she decided at “a very young age” that she wanted to be a veterinarian. It was her neighbor’s pet monkey, Poncho, that sparked her interest in primates: the mischievous creature would sneak in through the window and pull the dog’s tail, steal food, and even plunk keys on the piano. As a teenager, Kalema-Zikusoka joined her school’s wildlife club, and on a field trip to Queen Elizabeth National Park she saw firsthand how little wildlife remained, even in conservation areas. “I started thinking to myself, why can’t I become a vet who brings back the wildlife to Uganda?” While Kalema-Zikusoka’s veterinarian studies took her to the UK, she always planned to return to Uganda and build on the work of her father. “When I was old enough to understand what had happened to him, I felt like I wanted to continue his dream, his legacy, of a prosperous Uganda, through my passion for wildlife.” Health for all Less than a year after Kalema-Zikusoka began working at Bwindi, there was an outbreak of an unknown skin disease among the gorillas: they were losing hair and developing white, scaly skin. Kalema-Zikusoka consulted with a doctor friend, who told her about the human disease scabies, common at the time among low-income communities in rural Uganda. After chimpanzees and bonobos, gorillas are our closest genetic relatives, sharing around 98.4% of their DNA with humans. This genetic similarity also makes gorillas vulnerable to many of the same diseases as humans. Related article
      A conservationist is building bridges in the Amazon so monkeys can cross the road Kalema-Zikusoka and the team tracked down the afflicted gorilla family: it was Kacupira’s group, the gentle giant she had met on her first trek. Many of the apes were extremely unwell, including a baby gorilla that, despite medical interventions, died. “This made me realize that you couldn’t protect the gorillas without improving the health of their human neighbors,” she says. Bwindi is located in one of Uganda’s most densely populated rural regions, leaving limited space for a buffer zone. Instead, farmland and villages are pressed up against its borders. The park is also relatively small — at just 321 square kilometers (123 square miles), it is just 2% of the size of the 14,700-square-kilometer (5,600-square-mile) Serengeti in Tanzania — which puts further pressure on its borders and resources and increases the likelihood of human-gorilla interactions. To help remedy the situation Kalema-Zikusoka founded Conservation Through Public Health (CTPH) in 2003, a non-profit that has worked with around 10,000 households around the national park to improve the community’s health and well-being. Local farmers are trained to safely herd gorillas back to the forest when they venture onto community land, and a network of village health teams educates families on ways to improve hygiene and reduce the spread of disease. And now that the gorilla population is growing, so is tourism in the area: 27 gorilla families are now habituated to people, and the number of “gorilla tourists” in Uganda has risen from around 1,300 in 1993 to almost 39,000 in 2023. It’s improved the well-being of villagers living near the park, says Joshua Masereka, the community conservation warden at Uganda Wildlife Authority. “When tourists come to this place, there’s more money and therefore more benefits, more jobs, more opportunities, more developments,” he says, adding that the park allocates 20% of its revenue to community projects, such as building schools and roads. Related article
      This tourism experience costs $800 for an hour. Here’s why it’s worth it CTPH is one of the wildlife authority’s “prime partners” and has been pivotal to the conservation work at the park, says Masereka. “Gladys, I think she’s born with conservation in her blood. If you go through the life of her family, how she was brought up, she was brought up in that life of being a conservationist and I think she’ll die a conservationist.” Kalema-Zikusoka’s dedication has inspired others in the community into action. Born and raised around Bwindi, Alex Ngabirano worked for CTPH for 15 years, before starting his own non-profit organization, Mubare Biodiversity, which focuses on reforming poachers around the park. Gorillas are rarely poached intentionally, but subsistence hunters looking to put food on the table sometimes go after pigs or antelope in the forest, and accidentally snare or spear gorillas in the process. By educating the local community on the benefits of gorilla tourism, Ngabirano and his team have convinced more than 300 former poachers to give up their tools, and are now retraining them as rangers, guides, and farmers. “Dr. Gladys has done amazing work in Bwindi community. She’s the first person to introduce the one health approach in this area,” says Ngabirano. “The (community) started understanding that in the future, their children will become rangers and guides, all those jobs associated with conservation and tourism activities.” Kalema-Zikusoka’s conservation efforts have been recognized internationally, too: she is a National Geographic explorer, and her many accolades include the Whitley Gold Award in 2009, the Leopold Award in 2020, and the Tällberg-SNF-Eliasson Global Leadership Prize in 2022. And her hard work continues to show in the expanding gorilla population: in the last two months alone, three baby gorillas were born in the forest. “I always get very excited when I hear that a baby mountain gorilla has been born,” says Kalema-Zikusoka. “It gives me hope that the numbers are continuing to grow. It means that we’re bringing the gorillas back from the brink of extinction.” This story has been updated to correct Kalema-Zikusoka’s age when she first saw a mountain gorilla, and the year her father went missing.",,0.23683948814868927
"Britain’s Prince Harry said he was “in shock” after quitting as a patron of Sentebale, a British charity he set up to help young people with HIV and AIDS in Lesotho and Botswana, following a row between trustees and the chair of the board. Harry, the younger son of King Charles, co-founded Sentebale in 2006 in honor of his mother, Princess Diana, nine years after she was killed in a Paris car crash. Sentebale means “forget-me-not” in the local language of Lesotho in southern Africa. Co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, as well as the board of trustees, joined Harry in leaving Sentebale following a dispute with chair Sophie Chandauka, who has taken legal action to try to retain her position. In a joint statement with his co-founder, Harry said on Wednesday that it was “with heavy hearts” that they had resigned from their roles “until further notice.” Related article
      Heavily redacted documents reveal little in lawsuit over Prince Harry’s immigration records The trustees had acted in the best interests of the charity in asking the chair to step down, the joint statement said. “Although we may no longer be patrons, we will always be its founders, and we will never forget what this charity is capable of achieving when it is in the right care,” it continued. The specifics of the row within the charity are not yet clear. But in her own statement, Chandauka appeared to take a swipe at the 40-year-royal for “playing the victim card.” “Everything I do at Sentebale is in pursuit of the integrity of the organisation, its mission, and the young people we serve,” she said in a statement reported by Britain’s PA Media news agency. The news agency said she claimed she had reported the trustees to the UK’s Charity Commission and that a UK court had issued an injunction to stop her dismissal. CNN has not seen a copy of the alleged injunction from the UK’s High Court. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that no such order had been issued. “My actions are guided by the principles of fairness and equitable treatment for all, regardless of social status or financial means. There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct,” Chandauka said. She continued that the situation was “the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir – and the coverup that ensued.” Harry, who lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and two children, stopped working as a member of the royal family in 2020. While he gave up his military appointments and royal patronages when the couple stepped back from royal duties, he maintained many of his private causes and patronages, including Sentebale. • Sign up to CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls. Stepping away from the charity will be a blow to the prince, as the project is particularly close to his heart. He was inspired to set up Sentebale while visiting the kingdom of Lesotho during his gap year in 2004. The small African nation has some of the highest rates of HIV and AIDS in the world. Harry spoke passionately in 2020 about being “struck by the hardship and challenges so many children faced” and how the charity was set up “as a memory of both Prince Seeiso’s mother as well as my own.” He has traveled back to Lesotho a number of times over the years, most recently in October when he joined a fireside discussion to hear how Sentebale had improved people’s lives. It’s one of a number of causes Harry has worked on in Africa. Britain’s Charity Commission said in a statement reported by PA that it was “aware of concerns about the governance” and was “assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.” Sentebale said in a statement to PA that it had not received resignations from its royal patrons and described the “recalibration of the board” as “part of Sentebale’s ambitious transformation agenda.” This story has been updated with developments.",,0.26394566893577576
"Six Russian tourists were killed on Thursday after a viewing submarine sank near the Egyptian resort city of Hurghada, according to the local governor. Maj. Gen. Amr Hanafy confirmed the deaths in an update on the Red Sea Governorate’s official Facebook page. He said there were 45 passengers – including tourists from Russia, India, Norway and Sweden – onboard when the accident occurred, in addition to five Egyptian crew members. Apart from the six Russians, all the other tourists had been rescued, he said. Hanafy added that four of the tourists were in critical condition and currently receiving treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) at local hospitals. The incident – involving a vessel operated by Sindbad Submarines – took place in the waters off Egypt’s eastern coastline on Thursday morning. The submarine “crashed at a distance of 1 km from the shore” at around 10 a.m., according to the Russian consulate in Hurghada. The vessel was on a regular underwater excursion to inspect the coral reef, it continued, adding that most of those on board were rescued and taken to nearby hotels and hospitals. The governor said “investigations by the authorities are underway with the vessel’s crew to determine the cause of the incident,” but he noted that the submarine held a valid operating license and the crew leader held the required “scientific certificates.” In an accompanying video, Hanafy could be seen visiting nearby hospitals and talking with survivors, some of whom were wrapped in emergency blankets while others sat on hospital beds. Hurghada is a popular resort on Egypt’s Red Sea coast, roughly 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Cairo. The company that runs the submarine tours claims to be well-established in exploring the region’s dramatic seabed. Thursday’s forecast showed clear skies, light winds, and warm conditions. The temperature was around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) with winds under 10 kph, according to CNN meteorologists. CNN has reached out to the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities for comment. ‘Years of experience’ The operator of the submarine has an “expert team” with “years of experience,” according to its website, adding that its vessels were “engineered in Finland to sustain underwater pressure up to 75m, ensuring safety and reliability.” In an emergency, the company says “oxygen masks are located overhead and life vests under the seats.” Sindbad Submarines says it has two “recreational submarines” in its fleet, each of which could carry 44 passengers and two pilots with a “sizable round viewing window” for each passenger. The vessel could reach a depth of 25 meters (82 ft) below sea level for 40 minutes, allowing passengers to explore “500 meters of coral reef and its marine inhabitant.” The “spacious air-conditioned cabin” is also said to feature “comfortable seats and personal TV monitors.” In November, at least 16 people went missing after a tourist yacht sank in the Red Sea following warnings about rough seas. At the time, it was not immediately clear what caused the four-deck, wooden-hulled motor yacht to sink. Egypt’s tourism economy is among its key sources of revenue.

"Four women’s soccer players from Zambia have been removed from the national team ahead of upcoming internationals due to added challenges entering the United States. The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) announced on Wednesday that captain Barbra Banda, Racheal Kundananji, Prisca Chilufya and Grace Chanda, all of whom play for clubs in the US, won’t be traveling to China for the Yangchuan International Tournament. Travel to and from the US has become more difficult under the Trump administration with reports of detentions and visas being revoked for those entering the country. The FAZ said that the decision to exclude the quartet from upcoming games owed to “additional travel measures” being introduced by the new administration. “I wish to confirm that the Orlando Pride trio of Barbra Banda, Grace Chanda and Prisca Chilufya as well as Rachael Kundananji of Bay FC will not be available for the two international friendly matches in China,” general secretary Reuben Kamanga said in the announcement from FAZ. “After working through the process instigated by recently introduced measures it was decided that it is in the best interest of our players to skip this assignment. “They will definitely be available for future assignments as they were for the last window when we played Malawi. The technical bench has since roped in replacements to ensure that the team remains competitive.” Kamanga added that the decision was made after receiving advice from the United States of America Zambian mission in Washington, as well as Orlando Pride and Bay FC. Zambia’s women’s national team, nicknamed the Copper Queens, will face Thailand at the Yangchuan International Tournament in Chongqing, China on April 5.

Each design takes four to eight weeks to create, using carefully conceived geometric shapes to create an optical illusion of depth, and patterns she describes as “moving in a four-dimensional way.” “I realized that in designing, the Pythagoras theorem comes to play,” said Oliseh-Amaize, referencing the formula for calculating the relationship between the sides of a triangle. “My designs are all mathematics. You need to think of shapes and even calculate shapes that do not exist.” “Pyramids” is a knee-length dress made from one of the most common ankara fabrics and inspired by the pyramids of Giza, with prism-like shapes arranged in alternating directions. “Mpi” is Oliseh-Amaize’s take on a varsity jacket, embellished with rows of protruding cones, a nod to the animal horns used in Nigeria’s traditional Igbo culture for weddings, chieftaincy titles and as a musical instrument. “For Pyramids, I used geometric calculations, which is a very complex technique in fashion design,” Oliseh-Amaize said, while for Mpi, “I manipulated the fabric in geometrical dimensions to create each one of those horns. I thought that the real beauty of executing this inspiration would be more impactful if I have them all together in a cluster around the outfit.” “Taking it to the next level” Oliseh-Amaize’s design journey started out in the UK, at Middlesex University London, where she studied Fashion Product Management at the start of the millennium. A major break came after she returned to Nigeria and was crowned the country’s best designer at the 2006 Nigerian Fashion Show competition. She began designing for TV shows, and eventually relocated to the US, which she said “was like starting afresh.” Unlike Nigeria, where there’s a ready demand for ankara clothing, she had to prove her creativity to an American clientele, which meant “taking it to the next level.” Now based in Washington, DC, her eye-catching designs are increasingly in the spotlight. Last September she was invited to close the Ankara Festival Los Angeles, which celebrates African fashion, and her works were also shown at the Congressional Black Caucus and Philly Fashion Week that month. After the Ankara Festival, she said in a statement, “Outside Africa, when people hear “African prints,” it is as if the expectation is that it’s not truly African unless it looks primitive or poorly made. I’m rebelling against that. African fashion is rich, diverse, and deserves to be seen as sophisticated and high-quality.” Related article
      For Nigerian artist Nengi Omuku every painting has two sides It’s a stance that’s earning her celebrity supporters. Folake Olowofoyeku, star of US sitcom “Bob Hearts Abishola,” wore Tesslo’s “Hollywood” dress at the Ankara Festival, a design inspired by old-school Hollywood glamour, with sleeve cuffs shaped like mid-century lamps. Oliseh-Amaize has also received a commission by celebrity stylist J. Bolin for one of his high-profile clients. As Oliseh-Amaize establishes her own identity, she is stepping out of the shadow of her famous brother, who played for European soccer teams including Ajax and Juventus in 1990s and 2000s, as well as playing for and managing Nigeria’s national team. Growing up, “Everyone calling me Sunday Oliseh’s sister didn’t mean I had it easy,” she told CNN, saying that she would be overcharged when buying equipment, because people assumed she had money. “I had to work extra hard to get things,” she added. “Fashion Professor” Now, Oliseh-Amaize is helping younger designers through her “Fashion Professor” project. She has held 35 mentoring sessions on Instagram about everything from understanding different fabrics to knowing how to bill clients, teaching young designers to navigate the industry and to aspire beyond Nigeria.

      How African designers are making their mark on global fashion “I looked at how I could inspire the next generation of fashion designers within and beyond Nigeria and decided to mentor them and help them avoid my own mistakes while charting their own unique paths,” she explained. Her innovations in ankara designs come at a time when more Western designers are exploring the fabric. Oliseh-Amaize says they have the opportunity to do so because they can more easily access funding, which is not always the case for Nigerian designers. She emphasizes that African designers should not limit their thoughts to designing or selling to only Africans, and Oliseh-Amaize would like to see a time when a Nigerian brand can sell out in international department stores like Harrods or Macy’s. While her fashion creations are deeply rooted in Africa, Oliseh-Amaize insists that her identity as a designer goes beyond that. “I don’t want to be put in a box and labeled an African designer,” she said. “I want to be identified as a global brand designing for the global market. This is what would make me fulfilled.”",,0.3079403042793274
"When Innocent James completed his chores after school, he would light a kerosene lamp and lay down to read his books. There was no electricity in James’ part of Arusha, a region in northern Tanzania, and so his family was forced to burn expensive oil for him to learn after dark. Today, James is 33, and many parents in rural Tanzania – where all year round the sun sets at around 7pm – must still choose between saving money and allowing their children to read at night. But now, James’ company, Soma Bags, is providing a solution: backpacks equipped with solar panels that charge a reading light. What started as a small-scale project with some discarded cement bags, a sewing machine, and a solar panel, has become a business attracting charities and fashion brands from around the world. Last year, Soma Bags (“Reading Bags” in Swahili) sold 36,000 solar backpacks to people across Africa, providing an invaluable energy source for when the sun goes down. Affordable light for rural households James was brought up by his mother and grandmother, both schoolteachers, to love reading. At university in Mwanza, James was shocked at the number of schoolchildren he noticed on the street skipping class to ask for money, largely to spend in local video game cafés. He wanted to help them find the taste for learning that he remembered from his childhood. “I was frustrated,” James said, “I could see that the problem was much, much bigger than I thought.” Before his last semester, James dropped out of university and used the last of his tuition money to buy a mobile library cart. He began visiting schools, attracting hundreds of children to his reading clubs. But for all his hard work, there was a problem: children would borrow books from him and then return them unread. James soon realized that while they were eager to read, they could not afford to do so. Fewer than half of households in mainland Tanzania are connected to electricity. This falls to just over a third in rural areas. Consequently, many families rely on kerosene lamps to provide light after dark. These lamps produce dim light and are expensive to fill. They also pollute the air and carry the risk of burns. Parents often opt to send their children to bed, James explained, rather than allowing them to use the lamp to read. James’ solution – flexible solar panels sewn onto the outside of bags to power a reading light – was inspired by a university professor who carried around a solar charger for his phone, sewn into a fabric pouch. “It gave me the confidence that what I want is going to work,” said James. He started in 2016 by handmaking 80 backpacks per month, sewing on a solar panel sourced from China that charged during the children’s walk to and from school. By the time they returned home, they would have enough power for a reading light. A fully charged bag can power a light for six to eight hours, meaning that one day of bright weather can allow for multiple nights of reading, even if cloudy weather arrives. James says the solar backpacks are more affordable than using an oil lamp. A solar bag costs between 12,000 and 22,500 Tanzanian shillings (approximately $4-8), with the reading light included – the same price as 12-22.5 days of using a kerosene lamp, according to an average cost estimated in a survey of Soma Bags customers. Building the business Sold mainly from his growing franchise of mobile library carts, the bags became popular, and James increased production. He founded Soma Bags in 2019 and oversaw the construction of his own factory in the village of Bulale, in the Mwanza region, in 2020. The company now employs 65 staff. Made from repurposed cement bags found on the streets of Mwanza, where James lives, the backpack material is durable, lightweight, zero waste, and comes at no cost. The backpacks look good, too – in the middle of the bags, the white silhouette of a giraffe appears within bright yellow or green stripes. “It’s innovative,” said Joseph Manirakiza, of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which has supported Soma Bags since 2023. “I never thought someone would think of turning waste cement bags into something useful.” James’ customers are, in the main, families and schools in rural Tanzania – people and institutions with whom he is familiar from his library cart days. But the company is expanding; over 200 charities have bought bags from James to distribute amongst children in need, and Soma Bags is becoming increasingly popular in urban areas. While inside Soma’s smaller backpacks are battery-powered reading lights, its bigger bags now have in-built charging systems with a greater capacity, enabling them to power other electronic devices, like phone chargers. The company has also branched out into travel, sports, and cosmetic bags that aren’t solar-powered. James has sold backpacks to charities in Nigeria, Rwanda, Madagascar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and to fashion brands in Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Kenya. A growing industry Around 600 million Africans do not have access to electricity. Companies that produce solar-powered lamps are abundant on the continent, and the UN’s Solar Light Distribution Programme is part of a global effort to light up rural areas with affordable and sustainable energy. The hybrid social enterprise Smart Girls Uganda has produced and distributed over 12,000 of its own solar bags to children in Africa. “It is important for multiple companies to produce solar-powered bags across the continent,” said its CEO, Jamila Mayanja. “It’s more than just lighting; it’s about giving them control over their education, their future, and ultimately helping to break the cycle of poverty in their communities.” Soma Bags has been recognized by numerous awards and institutions, including the UNDP and the British government. “There is a crop of young people [in Tanzania] who are coming up, and they have realized that they have to take the future into their own hands,” said Manirakiza. “Innocent represents a group of young people using their talent to do something meaningful.” As his company continues to expand, James is becoming increasingly busy, but he still finds time to run reading groups for children from his mobile cart twice a week. Now, kids arrive for his readings with his bags on their backs. “Sometimes I see a kid with the bag, and I’m like, wow,” said James, smiling, “I can’t really believe it.”",,0.23237749934196472
"Nigeria is going to Cannes. In what is understood﻿ to be a first in the film festival’s near-80 year history, a movie from Africa’s most populous nation has been chosen as part of the Cannes Film Festival’s Official Selection. “My Father’s Shadow,” directed by Akinola Davies Jr. and co-written with his brother, writer Wale Davies, stars Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù (“Slow Horses,” “Gangs of London”). The film is set in Lagos in the aftermath of the 1993 presidential election and follows Dìrísù’s father and two sons Remi and Akin, as they attempt an odyssey across the city amid the election’s turbulent fallout. Davies Jr.’s semi-autobiographical debut feature, produced by Element Pictures in association with Fatherland Productions and Crybaby, already has strong support in the form of distributor MUBI, which snatched up the rights to the film in North America and other territories long before the news of its Cannes debut was announced – lending additional hype to an already buzzy title. The movie will screen in the Un Certain Regard strand – a competition for debut and ascendant filmmakers. Fatherland says it will be the first Nigerian film to do so. Reacting to the announcement, Davies Jr.’ told CNN in a statement, “This is a testament to everyone dedicated to telling authentic Nigerian stories: from crews, to the countless technicians who power our film industry. “It honors all those – past, present, and future – who laid the foundation for Nigerian cinema. I’m excited to be an ambassador for arthouse film in Nigeria, and even more excited for our cast and crew, whose talent and hard work truly deserve this spotlight.” “My Father’s Shadow” is produced by Rachel Dargavel for Element Pictures and Funmbi Ogunbanwo for Fatherland Productions. Fatherland’s CEO Ogunbanwo told CNN, “It’s an incredible feeling to see our fully Nigerian story – rooted in Wale and Akin’s experience of losing their father at a young age – come to life on a world stage. “We wove in Yoruba, Pidgin, familiar street names from Lagos and Ibadan, capturing the essence of our home. I feel both excitement and a weight of responsibility, representing independent Nigerian filmmakers who create against the odds. We hope people who watch this film will discover who we are as a people, understand where we come from, and see that this is only the start of how far our stories can go.” Africa at Cannes 2025 The Cannes Film Festival announced it had screened 2,909 feature films to curate its 2025 lineup. Of those selected, “My Father’s Shadow” won’t be the sole representative from Africa this year. Also in Un Certain Regard is “Aisha Can’t Fly Away” by Egyptian filmmaker Morad Mostafa, about a Somali woman working in Cairo, and “Promised Sky” by French Tunisian Erige Sehiri. Meanwhile, Swedish director Tarik Saleh, who has Egyptian heritage, is in competition for the Palme d’Or with “Eagles of the Republic” telling the story of an adored Egyptian actor who falls into disgrace. The US-set “The History of Sound,” starring Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor, is directed by South African Oliver Hermanus. African cinema, particularly from Francophone nations, has a long history at Cannes, the world’s most prestigious film festival. Directing giants including the late Djibril Diop Mambéty of Senegal, the late Souleymane Cissé of Mali and Chadian Mahamat-Saleh Haroun all made the festival a home from home. Recently, a new guard of young filmmakers has emerged – notably, with more women – including Welsh Zambian Rungano Nyoni, French Senegalese Mati Diop (niece of Djibril), Senegalese director Ramata-Toulaye Sy and Tunisian Kaouther Ben Hania. But despite having the continent’s largest and most prolific filmmaking industry, Nigeria has had little representation at the festival. Nigerian productions have appeared in festival sidebars like the International Critics Week (where “Ezra” by Newton I. Aduaka screened in 2007). ﻿But a search of the festival’s online archives shows no evidence a Nigerian movie has ever been a part of Cannes’ Official Selection – comprising the competition for the Palme d’Or, Un Certain Regard, Cannes Premieres, Special Screenings, Midnight Screenings and Cannes Classics. Thierry Frémaux, general delegate of the festival, said at the press conference announcing the 2025 lineup on April 10 that the festival would be checking to confirm if indeed “My Father’s Shadow” marks a historic first Nigerian feature. Nigeria’s big moves Nigeria will have a big presence at Cannes this year. At the festival’s international village, Nigeria is back with its own national pavilion. There, the Ministry of Arts, Culture, Tourism and the Creative Economy will launch Screen Nigeria as part of the “Destination 2030; Nigeria Everywhere” campaign – a broad plan to create 2 million jobs in creative and tourism industries, and contribute $100 billion to Nigeria’s GDP by 2030. The goal is to showcase the nation’s talent and promote international collaboration and attract foreign investment. With the likes of “My Father’s Shadow” and other recent festival titles like “Mami Wata,” the first Nigerian film to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2023, there are signs that Nigeria’s film industry is diversifying. The 78th Cannes Film Festival runs from May 13-24. The premiere date for “My Father’s Shadow,” and its theatrical release date, are yet to be announced.",,0.4169280230998993
"Every year, about one billion tires around the world reach the end of their life according to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Many of them end up piled in landfills posing potential health and environmental risks. In Africa, one Rwandan entrepreneur has found a way to upcycle the rubber to create fashionable footwear. While studying creative design at the University of Rwanda, Kevine Kagirimpundu felt she had limited employment options, so she took matters into her own hands. She began researching how to make her own products and stumbled upon the idea of using old tires for shoe soles. In 2013, she and her friend Ysolde Shimwe officially launched Uzuri K&Y, a name incorporating the founders’ initials and a Swahili word meaning beauty and goodness. The eco-friendly shoe brand offers a range of handcrafted sandals for men, women and children. “We wanted to be different but also be part of the problem-solving process because Rwanda at the time was banning plastic bags, which was such a huge inspiration for us. So, we thought how do we play a part in that and how do we contribute?” Kagirimpundu said. “We thought this creates something that would become a source of income for ourselves but also for other young people like us.” In 2008, the government banned the manufacturing, importation and use of plastic polyethylene bags, and took a step further in 2019 by prohibiting single-use plastics, like straws, bottles, and containers. As CEO and managing director, Kagirimpundu says the brand’s mission aligns with Rwanda’s efforts to cut back on waste. The company buys tires from local landfills and makes the sandals in its Kigali production facility. When running at full capacity, Kagirimpundu says it can produce more than 4,500 pairs of sandals a month, which it sells online and in several stores across Rwanda and Nairobi, Kenya. A report from the Rwanda Environment Management Authority found the country discarded more than 5,000 tons of tires in 2022. Kagirimpundu said to date Uzuri K&Y has removed 10 metric tons of rubber from landfills in Rwanda. Still, the CEO believes the company’s human impact is just as important as the environmental aspect: “We had to create a business that actually became a source of employment for women,” she said. Empowering women Reflecting on the company’s humble beginnings, Kagirimpundu said one of the biggest challenges was a lack of skilled labor. “Nobody knew how to make shoes,” she said, so she decided to set up a training program to teach locals the skills they need to become artisans and entrepreneurs. Kagirimpundu says 1,500 young people have gone through the program, about 70% of them women. She added that it’s “priceless” to give a woman a steady income when Rwanda has an unemployment rate of 13%, 14.5% for women. “It’s the whole collective of women working together to create something big, something important,” she said.",,0.36986595392227173
"Millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa rely on money sent to them by relatives living abroad. But it costs more to send this money — known as remittances — to sub-Saharan Africa than any other region in the world, according to the World Bank. In recent years, a number of African-founded financial technology (fintech) companies have emerged, with the aim of bringing down costs and carving into the dominant market share of traditional players like Western Union and MoneyGram. The potential benefits are huge; the less it costs to send money to Africa, the more money is likely to be sent. An increased flow of foreign currency can act as a lifeline for both individuals and national economies. Worth $54 billion to sub-Saharan Africa in 2023, remittances account for more than a fifth of GDP of the Gambia, Lesotho, and Comoros, and more than a tenth of Liberia, Cape Verde, and Guinea-Bissau. They are more valuable to Kenya than its key exports. And estimates are generally assumed to be lower than the real figure due to the prevalence of unrecorded payments made through informal networks. “Not only do (remittances to low-and-middle income countries) exceed foreign direct investment and official development assistance (combined), but it also somehow remains constant,” said Christian Kingombe, managing partner of “impact investment” advisor 4IP group, and formerly with the African Development Bank. “So it is really a very important source of development,” he added. The problem with cash Sending money to sub-Saharan Africa costs the sender an average of 8.37% of the total value of the transaction, as of Q2 2024, according to the World Bank, compared to 5.53% in South Asia. How can fintechs bring that number down? The first challenge is to move customers away from making cash payments. A survey by Visa found that 12% of global consumers still send remittances by mail as cash, checks or money orders. Processing cash is more expensive than digital money, explained Andy Jury, CEO of Mukuru, a big remittance player serving Africa and founded by a Zimbabwean entrepreneur, that processes both cash and digital payments, because cash requires a large physical infrastructure, including booths, tellers, and supplies of cash. While the average cost of sending money to sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world, the cost of digital remittances to the region is less than the global average. If more Africans sent money home via digital services rather than cash, average remittance fees should fall, but receiving money online requires the internet, which is used in sub-Saharan Africa by only 37% of people, according to the World Bank. Even when users have access to mobile apps, it’s not always easy to persuade them to move over from the tried and trusted cash model. “Imagine a world in which you’ve grown up in a cash-to-cash ecosystem — it’s a sort of leap of faith to leave your money in this esoteric, intangible thing,” explained Jury. “(But) if you get somebody to use it, they educate themselves on the benefit, and they can get that ‘aha!’ moment. That’s the most powerful conversion tool.” It’s mainly young people who are making the switch, said Nicolai Eddy, COO of NALA, a remittance fintech founded in Tanzania that facilitates payments to 11 African countries and last year raised $40 million from investors. “It’s really like 35 (year olds) and below where there’s a huge focus on the digital side of things,” he said. “People in their fifties and sixties, they’re used to the person at the shop who they know, and they just continue to go there.” Building trust is a challenge, but with a growing youth population and a steady flow of migrants moving abroad, the potential user base is expanding. Bypassing the middlemen Luring customers over from cash is one piece of the puzzle. But digital payments have their own costs. Historically, sending money to Africa via a remittance company has been a complex process involving many different parties. “It’s so bloody difficult to move money around,” said Jury. The middlemen — mainly the third parties used to move money between banks, and the foreign exchange traders who find and negotiate the best rates — all want a cut, and they can drive up costs and cause delays. In recent years, fintechs — like NALA, Flutterwave, LemFi, Chipper Cash, Leatherback, and many more — have emerged with a model of cutting out the middlemen and enabling instant payments. Many of these new fintechs hold liquidity in every country in which they operate, explained Eddy. This allows them to deposit funds directly into the local bank account or digital wallet of the receiver instantly. Often, these companies use their own software wherever possible to move money around, as well as having their own teams to negotiate on the foreign exchange market, removing the reliance on third parties. “We’re cutting out two steps, in some cases it’s like five or six steps,” explained Eddy. But bypassing the middlemen is not easy. As well as developing in-house software, it means working directly with banks and governments to acquire licenses to transfer money internally within African countries, each of which has different requirements. Sending money between African countries can be especially costly; in Q4 of 2023, fees were an average of 33% for remittances of $200 from Tanzania to neighboring Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. “We’ve got 50 different payment use case licenses in 15 different territories, and that’s taken nearly two decades to build up,” said Jury. “Very few environments have alignment in terms of what they require; one market might require a passport as proof of identity, another one might take a driver’s license. All of that variability increases the costs.” Although still in its infancy, the Pan African Payment Settlement System (PAPSS) is designed to unify regulation across different African countries. “I love that sort of stuff because it creates harmony,” said Jury. “Whether it’s centrally dictated, whether it’s ourselves creatively integrating (with other fintechs), we’re constantly on the lookout for those things.” Regulation The UN has targeted a global average of 3% for remittance fees. According to Eddy, the biggest inhibitor for fintechs in Africa to lower their costs is the fees charged by banks and digital wallets for locally depositing money to receivers. He wants governments to limit fees for things like sending money to family. “If they cap those fees for those types of transactions, we could be processing at 1% (total fees),” he said. But according to Dr Joseph Antwi Baafi, senior lecturer at Akentien Appiah-Menka University of Skills Training and Entrepreneurial Development in Kumasi, Ghana, governments should focus on helping to reduce operating costs for remittance fintechs and the companies that operate digital wallets in Africa. “Governments (can play) a huge role in terms of infrastructure support, in terms of tax support, to help these network operators to operate at their full capacity and full efficiency. And that will bring down charges,” he said. For Jury, the key to success is to tailor the product to the user’s needs. “If you come at this with a Silicon Valley mind(set) where you’re going to take a small proposition, throw lots of money (at it) and scale it up, you come unstuck very quickly,” Jury said. “But if you can take a global platform or infrastructure and ensure you appreciate the local idiosyncrasies and invent something that’s relevant to a customer, there’s a massive, massive tidal wave of opportunity coming.”",,0.21295291185379028
"Africa’s electric vehicle (EV) market is accelerating. But so far, one particular group of potential users — rural women — has largely been left behind, with investors favoring electric motorbike start-ups that serve a predominantly urban and male clientele. One company thinks it has the answer: electric tricycles. “The boys with the two-wheelers get all the money,” said Shantha Bloemen, founder of Mobility for Africa, a Zimbabwean start-up with a 77% female customer base and one of a handful of EV companies in Africa operating solely in rural areas. Bloemen exclusively supplies tricycles, generally preferred by female riders in rural areas due to their non-straddling seat and greater stability on uneven roads. “Three-wheelers mean you’re inclusive of women,” she said. Bloemen sees tricycles as the key to unlocking for rural women the potential of Africa’s EV market, which is expected to grow to $28.3 billion by 2030, according to data from Mordor Intelligence. She wants the continent to follow in the footsteps of Asia-Pacific, where tricycles are popular. “I want to be everywhere,” she said, “I want to be the queen of tricycles.” For her customers, the vehicles, designed to cope with the unsurfaced roads, are transformative. “It has changed (our) way of life,” said Beauty Simango, 33, resident of the Zimbabwean village of Hauna and, since May last year, one of more than 300 people to lease or buy an electric tricycle from Mobility for Africa. Simango no longer spends hours each day walking to fetch water or deliver crops to the market. By transporting goods and running a taxi service, her weekly income has increased from $30 to $150, although she now pays $65 towards her lease and regular battery swapping. Within 12 months, she will have paid off the price of the vehicle ($2,340). With her weekly profit, Simango pays her children’s school fees and funds farming projects. “It has helped our self-esteem as women,” she added. Related article
      Electric motorcycle completes solar-powered 6,000-kilometer journey through Africa But Mobility for Africa has struggled with a lack of investment. While Bloemen has raised a total of $6 million since 2019, half of which is from grants, including $380,000 from the Toyota Mobility Foundation, companies selling motorbikes in cities have been far more successful. Ampersand in Rwanda, whose clientele is, according to CEO Josh Whale, “overwhelmingly” male, raised over $21 million in a single year ending in August 2024. Spiro, the giant of the sector, has tens of millions of dollars in financing. Most EV companies are focused on urban areas due to greater population density, said Tom Courtright, research director at the Africa E-Mobility Alliance think tank. Currently, most electric bikes and trikes must regularly swap their batteries at purpose-built facilities (Mobility for Africa currently has six such facilities) — but the cost of building and running these facilities can deter investors in areas with low populations. Currently, Courtright said, “urban areas are a better bet.” For now, women in rural Africa must wait for the EV revolution to reach them. “Things are definitely moving in that direction,” said Ampersand’s Whale, “it’s just that the low hanging fruit is in the cities.”",,0.24408768117427826

It’s a world of endless parties and sleepless nights. A relentless celebration that turns West Africa – and especially Nigeria’s largest city, Lagos – into one of the hottest destinations on the continent, if not the planet, right in the middle of winter. Detty December is a magical time between December and early January when diaspora communities and tourists flock to Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa for an unforgettable experience filled with flavourful food, soulful African music and sunshine. Beach parties, festivals and top-tier performances fuel the energy, while fashion takes center stage, with everyone dressing to impress. Nearly two-thirds of Nigeria’s population is under 25, according to the United Nations Population Fund, making this one of the world’s youngest countries. Internationally renowned Afrobeats performers and foreign artists make surprise appearances. DJs take to the streets, blasting powerful beats from consoles mounted atop bright yellow minibuses. At times it’s all-consuming. Good luck getting hair salon appointments, affordable air tickets or navigating Lagos’ already notorious traffic when the party crowds are in town. Detty December (“detty” is a playful corruption of “dirty”) is a triumphant celebration of culture, music and good vibes that has evolved in recent years during the traditional holidays influx of diaspora returnees, which heightened in 2018 when Ghana ran a launched a successful “Year of Return” campaign actively encouraging people to visit their ancestral homelands. It’s gathered pace over the past five years, gaining an international reputation, as IJGBs (“I Just Got Backs”) and their friends arrive in batches, eager to unwind and blow off steam after the fast-paced, hard-working year they’ve had overseas. For many in the vast Nigerian diaspora, it is a deeply personal homecoming, a chance to reconnect with their heritage, traditions and families while immersing themselves in the lively energy of Nigerian life. ‘Everyone is on a vibe of happiness’ Cynthia Eniola Oyeneyin, who moved from Nigeria to the UK at the age of nine, is a Detty December regular. Despite living abroad for most of her life, she returns to Nigeria every year to reunite with family and friends. “It’s always important for me to go back to my roots and to go back to my culture,” she says. “Nigeria, for me, will always be home, so when I go back, I’m happiest. And mainly because, especially in December, everyone is on a vibe of happiness.” Many locals also look forward to joining the party. “I also look forward to attending Christmas parties and family Christmas gatherings which is a cultural thing in Nigeria where we cook and host each other and it’s always a good time,” says Ademidun Akindele. “This December was really good. Lagos is extremely populated during this time of the year but I can’t complain because it’s good for the economy and it’s amazing to see people.” Related article
      ‘Black is beautiful’: Why Nigerians think their Guinness is better than Ireland’s What makes the Nigerian Detty December unique? For starters, Nigeria’s entertainment scene is buzzing during Detty December, offering an abundance of performances headlined by some of the biggest Afrobeats stars, like Burna Boy, Wizkid, Ayra Starr and Tems. Festivals such as the Calabar Carnival in Cross River State, referred to as “Africa’s biggest street party,” and the Flytime Fest music festival in Lagos provide once-in-a-lifetime experiences, drawing massive crowds eager to immerse themselves in the culture. Many events are organized by Cultur FM, an influential brand that boasts a large global presence and serves as a unique platform celebrating the richness of African music. It aims to spotlight the often-overlooked talent in the genre, shifting focus from Western DJs who have embraced these sounds to the African artists and DJs who define them. During the latest Detty December, Cultur FM staged a series of creative events in Lagos. Collaborating with brands like Air Peace, Pepsi Nigeria and Hennessy Nigeria on gatherings that celebrated African pride while connecting deeply with local communities. ‘Back where it all started’ “We wanted to go back to where it all started,” a Cultur FM founder told CNN Travel. He didn’t want his name revealed in line with the organization’s brand anonymity. “It was essential to involve local people and celebrate the vibrant creativity of these streets.” He said the standout from the 2024 lineup was an unforgettable block party in Surulere, the iconic Lagos neighborhood that birthed music legends like Wizkid and Oxlade. Departing from the typical glitzy beach club scene, this free community event aimed to honor its roots. DJ booths were set up on yellow mini-buses, Oxlade delivered an electrifying performance, and brands distributed free merchandise and drinks. As Detty December gains prominence each year, so does Cultur FM’s influence. The group plans to expand into Ghana and South Africa, continuing to disrupt the music scene, inspire pride in African heritage and connect the diaspora with its roots. But it’s not just the events — FOMO (fear of missing out) is real! Lagos during Detty December is bustling with energy, and even if you’re not there, social media feeds will be packed with pictures and videos of people’s highlight reels from their vacations. From glamorous weddings — because, lest we forget, December is peak wedding season in Nigeria — to house parties, beach day parties and long-awaited family reunions, there’s never a dull moment. For most tourists and the Nigerian diaspora, the trip feels worth every penny. The favorable currency conversion for travelers from countries such as the UK, the US and Canada makes luxury experiences and indulgences more accessible. This affordability, combined with the promise of unforgettable memories, makes it hard to resist hopping on a plane for the ultimate holiday. And that’s not all: Local businesses thrive during this period, with vendors, restaurants, and hotels reaping the rewards, in turn providing a boost to the Nigerian economy. Related video
      How one woman drove from London to Lagos in her old Peugeot 107 “One of the things I’ve observed the most is the positive economic impact this December has on Nigeria,” says Cynthia. “People are coming to Nigeria to have fun and pumping money into the economy, bringing in more jobs for, you know, the less fortunate as well, and it’s so beautiful to watch.” Of course, no good thing comes without challenges. While Detty December feels like a haven of fun, there are certainly drawbacks. Flights to Lagos from the UK, US, and Canada become expensive, especially during this period, prompting  IJGBs and frequent visitors to book within the first three months of the year to avoid sky-high costs. Additionally, as an emerging market, Nigeria’s infrastructure often struggles to handle the influx of visitors during Detty December, leading to severe traffic jams that are a nightmare to navigate. “Lagos is already populated, but come December, you know most people in the diaspora come to Nigeria,” says Ademidun. “This year, I even noticed more people who aren’t even of Nigerian heritage coming into the country to participate in the events, which was interesting, but it just meant everywhere was packed. So, getting a nail appointment, or a hair appointment wasn’t impossible but it was tricky. There is also a lot of traffic, which we expected but traffic jams are a major hindrance of enjoyment.” Ademidun’s experience highlights the strain on everyday life during Detty December. But beyond the inconvenience, there’s a deeper issue at play – the impact the celebration has on locals. Many would like to experience the festivities in full but are met with soaring prices driven up by tourists with deep pockets. This effectively excludes some from enjoying simple pleasures like food, events, beach clubs, and getaways in their own country. Despite these challenges, Detty December has elevated Nigeria’s global profile, drawing visitors eager to immerse themselves in the festivities. The rich culture, nonstop entertainment, and viral #DettyDecember posts have transformed the country into an even more sought-after vacation destination. Beyond the partying, it serves as a stage for cultural exports, from authentic traditional cuisine to Afrobeats and the resurgence of Y2K fashion, infused with fashions inspired by Nigeria’s “Nollywood” movie scene, turning every moment of Detty December into a celebration of Nigeria’s cultural richness. Detty December is no ordinary festive season, it’s a movement that unites people from all walks of life in a celebration of African excellence. It places West Africa in the spotlight and as Lagos shines brightly for the world to see, it’s evident that this isn’t merely a homecoming for the diaspora or a festive holiday destination — it’s an ode to Nigeria’s unyielding spirit and its ever-growing influence on the global cultural stage.",,0.23533007502555847
"When Delphyne Dabezies first announced her plans to launch Africa’s first caviar manufacturer, some in the luxury food industry were incredulous. But now, 15 years since founding her company, Acipenser, with its Rova and Kasnodar Caviar brands, Dabezies’ products have made their way into some of the most prestigious kitchens in the world. High in the mountains of Madagascar, just east of the capital Antananarivo, Lake Mantasoa has emerged as an unlikely source of this opulent ingredient. “Every expert was saying it was impossible,” Dabezies told CNN. The history and luxury of caviar Caviar is a delicacy made from the salted eggs of sturgeon fish. Traditionally sourced from Russia’s Caspian Sea, it gained luxury status in the 17th century after Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich I made caviar a state monopoly. Production soon spread around the world. With the establishment of Acipenser in Madagascar, caviar is now produced on every inhabited continent other than Australia. Due both to its cultural significance and the long maturation period of sturgeon fish – between eight and 20 years – caviar can fetch﻿ prices as high as $27,000 a teaspoon. And then there is the coveted taste. “You just sort of press it against your palate,” Nichola Fletcher, author of “Caviar: A Global History,” told CNN, “and the little eggs dissolve into deliciousness.” Inspired by a television program on sturgeon farming in France, French trio Dabezies, her husband Christophe, and their friend Alexandre Guerrier, decided to pursue a similar project in their adopted home of Madagascar, where they were already working in the textile trade. Dabezies said they began “without any knowledge” of caviar production. “Nobody in the beginning though it was possible, and nobody wanted to help us,” Dabezies said. It took the arrival of a retired sturgeon farming expert Francoise Rennes, on vacation in Madagascar, to help them get their project of the ground. And then one day, driving to their weekend house, they saw the lake. Lake Mantasoa is situated at an altitude of approximately 1,400 meters (4,590 feet) in the Madagascan highlands, a temperate zone atypical for the tropics. It turned out to be “absolutely the perfect environment to grow the sturgeon,” said Dabezies. Unlike in the Northern Hemisphere where low water temperatures can cause the fish to stop growing, Lake Mantasoa ranges between 13 and 23 degrees Celsius, allowing the fish to grow year-round. Consequently, Dabezies’s fish mature around two years faster. Soon, the dream of three novice sturgeon farmers became a reality. Today, their caviar production comprises both land and lake-based ponds in Madagascar, farming six species of sturgeon. Breaking into the global market The culinary world was wary when Acipenser produced the first batch of its premium Rova Caviar, named after the historical Madagascan Queen’s Palace in Antananarivo, in 2017. Madagascar is known for its vanilla, not its fish eggs. “At the beginning it was difficult,” said Dabezies. “Everyone was laughing – it was a joke. But the only way to prove that the caviar is excellent is to taste it.” The opportunity arrived when Europe’s top chefs sampled the produce at the prestigious culinary expo Sirha Lyon in 2019. Since then, Rova Caivar has appeared on high-end menus around the world, including the five-star Hôtel de Crillon in Paris and the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz. “Here we have a caviar that is full of indulgence,” said Julia Sedefjian, who was the youngest ever chef to run a Michelin-starred kitchen in France, and who created a dish with Rova Caviar for last December’s La Grande Tablée in Paris, a gala dinner presented by nonprofit La Tablée des Chefs. “A caviar that could suit all palates, (with a) buttery, brioche-like and hazelnut flavor on the finish.” The caviar has proved popular in Africa, too; Le Saint-Gerán Hotel in Mauritius, and the Constance Lemuria and Constance Ephelia in the Seychelles have all served it. “For chefs now, it’s a selling point to have caviar from Madagascar on the plate,” Dabezies argued. Rova’s most expensive product sells for €11,670 (around $11,960) per kilogram. Investing in the community Madagascar is one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth and is home to thousands of species found nowhere else in the world. Dabezies, along with Christophe and Guerrier, has lived there for nearly 30 years. “It’s given us a lot,” she said, and so “the most important thing is that the business provides a profit to local people and to the country.” Acipenser employs around 300 people, 80% of whom are from the local municipality of Ambatolaona. The company provides training in fish farming and caviar production, and offers medical coverage, literacy courses and family planning education. It has recently been granted a lease by the government that will allow it to re-forest and protect 200 hectares of hills around Lake Mantasoa. Acipenser says it is taking steps to ensure the lake’s sustainability, including by restocking it to support local fisheries, installing a water monitoring system, and facilities to prevent water pollution. “A unique place with incredible potential” The ultimate goal for many caviar makers is to produce Beluga caviar, the most expensive and luxurious form of caviar, made from the Beluga sturgeon, the species that takes the longest to mature and that produces the biggest eggs. As of last year, Acipenser had its first Beluga fish in Madagascar. This year, it is aiming to produce Beluga caviar for the first time. “Madagascar is a unique place with incredible potential,” Dabezies said, “We are proud to be a part of its story and to share its treasures with the world.”",,0.2547375559806824
"Only 26 African countries had achieved independence when, in February 1961, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie ascended a sloping staircase to inaugurate Africa Hall in Addis Ababa, which he gifted as the new headquarters for the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). A dominating presence in the heart of the Ethiopian capital, adorned with a sweeping 150-square-meter (1,614-square-foot) stained-glass window, the structure, designed by Italian architect Arturo Mezzedimi, had taken just 18 months to build. Fittingly then, it didn’t take long before the building became the site of a landmark event in the story of modern Africa. Just over two years later, Selassie once again made the climb to welcome the founding members of the newly formed Organization of African Unity (OAU) to their home — a meeting place intended to foster cooperation, drive economic progress and eradicate colonialism across the continent. Addressing representatives of the then-32 independent African states, Selassie declared that the continent was “at midcourse, in transition from the Africa of yesterday to the Africa of tomorrow.” “We must act to shape and mold the future and leave our imprint on events as they slip past into history,” he continued. More than 60 years later, Selassie’s message has come full-circle: Africa Hall has been shaped and molded anew. Last October marked the completion of a decade-long renovation across the entirety of the 12,800 square-meter site, commissioned by the ECA in 2013 with a $57 million budget to revitalize the landmark as a world-class conference and cultural venue. Australian design practice Architectus Conrad Gargett was entrusted with leading the re-design, giving project architect Simon Boundy a mission with dual themes — modernization and conservation. “The two go hand-in-hand with projects like this,” Boundy told CNN, “Where you’ve got an aging asset, but if it doesn’t get used, it falls into disrepair.” “It’s about bringing the building back to life, making it accessible to the public and celebrating the story of the building for future generations.” Building balance The conundrum for Boundy and his team was that those two aims threatened to undermine the historical significance of Africa Hall. In essence, how do you modernize a historical landmark without losing some of its soul? As a heritage architect — regularly tasked with making sensitive changes to buildings of historical or cultural importance — Boundy is well-versed in answering that question. The first step was understanding Africa Hall’s importance and history, which was aided by hiring local architects and engineers to work on the renovation. Among them was Mewded Wolde, who, a day before her university graduation in 2014, found herself on the roof of Africa Hall taking measurements. Born and raised in Addis Ababa, Wolde says the building — which hosted OAU meetings until the organization was replaced by the African Union (AU) in 2002, which eventually moved into new headquarters in Addis Ababa — is a source of pride for herself and many others given its role in helping countries across the continent achieve independence from colonial rule. “This building, still for the African Union, is a symbol,” Wolde told CNN. “It’s an artwork in itself that symbolizes the struggle that we have gone through in the past 60, 70 years to get to African unity.” Local knowledge helped Boundy navigate the “balancing act” of modernizing Africa Hall without devaluing its legacy. Roughly 13 million new tiles were fabricated and reinstalled to exactly match the original material, staying true to the brown, orange and off-white color palette of Mezzedimi’s modernist design.

      This Nigerian designer is making waves with her ‘four-dimensional’ fashion The old layout of the Plenary Hall was deemed to lack seating space, so after consulting the building’s original architectural drawings, the team designed new furniture in the same style and added an extra ring of seating. Hidden in each desk is a digital screen, a subtle addition that — along with the arrival of a 13-meter-wide (42-foot-wide) LED display — leaves Africa Hall well suited to meet the technological requirements of modern conference hosting, while preserving the original architecture. “We don’t want to leave our mark on the building,” Boundy said. “We want to just bring the original design to life again and hopefully everything that we do is behind the scenes, concealed in the ceilings, and it’s not the feature.” Some aspects, however, demanded more radical change, especially those concerning accessibility and safety. The building — “quite dilapidated” — was stripped back to its structural core and strengthened with carbon fiber and steel before being built up again, Boundy explained, to protect the concrete from the damage caused by rusting steel and the threat of seismic activity. Total Liberation Protective measures also included a strengthened frame for the crown jewel of Africa Hall: the two-story stained-glass window that has adorned the foyer since 1961. Titled “The Total Liberation of Africa,” it was Ethiopian artist Afewerk Tekle’s signature piece and is split into three panels; Africa Then, Africa Then and Now, and Africa Now and in the Future. Featuring a knight in shining armor emblazoned with the UN logo, a dragon and the grim reaper, the work tells a story of liberation, of “slaying the demons” of colonization, Boundy explained. Tekle’s work is Africa Hall’s definitive symbol, and can be seen splashed across shirts, ties and more in the city. “The symbolism of the artwork is something that’s really hard to overstate, how important that is,” Boundy said. “It really tells the story of what Africa Hall is trying to represent, which is the very best of what Africa can do, quite literally shedding the recent history, and looking very much forward … You can sit and spend hours staring at it.” With various original pieces either loose or missing, the entire artwork was meticulously disassembled, cleaned and restored panel-by-panel by Emmanuel Thomas, the grandson of the person who originally made the stained glass from Tekle’s design. Its refreshed look was unveiled alongside a new permanent exhibition to highlight the key events at Africa Hall that have helped to shape Pan-African history. For Wolde, both the artwork and the renovation itself are reflective of Selassie’s 1963 address, where he spoke of molding the Africa of tomorrow. “Even now, even with all the upgrades that have happened in Africa Hall, this quote is actually true,” Wolde said. “This is the space that we’re going to use to shape the future. Even then it was where they were having meetings … to shape the future of Africa, and even now, it symbolizes that. I really love this.”",,0.23375296592712402
"Alma Asinobi’s mission to break the world record for the fastest time to visit every continent came to an unsuccessful conclusion at the end of March. But she succeeded in calling attention to the issue she aimed to highlight through the trip: just how hard it is to travel with certain passports. The 26-year-old Nigerian travel content creator was attempting to beat the current record of 64 hours, held by an American traveler who broke the record in February 2025. When she was initially planning her attempt, the time to beat was 73 hours. She completed the trip in 71 hours and 26 minutes, after flight delays and visa issues derailed her journey. Asinobi says she wanted to spotlight the issue of “passport privilege.” The Nigerian passport is 92nd on a list of 102 on the Henley Passport Index, a ranking of all the world’s passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa. During the journey, she says there were “access and options” denied her, and extra checks she was subjected to because of her “low-mobility” passport. And so despite traveling from Antarctica to South America, to North America then Europe, Africa and Asia within the space of a few days, bureaucracy was one headwind she could not overcome. How the other half travel The vlogger took her first international trip to Benin, West Africa, in early 2020, a trip she said made her curious “to see what else was out there.” Since then, she has visited about 35 countries, including her recent record attempt. While documenting her travels, Asinobi says she noticed that influencers focused more on the destinations, and not their efforts to get there. She experienced lengthy, expensive and difficult visa processes and decided to create social media content catering to fellow low-mobility passport holders. In 2024, after applying for a visa to a European country three times before getting approved, she decided it was an issue worth taking to the global stage. “This is something that … more than half of the world population actually experience,” she said. “They don’t have passport privilege. But we don’t talk about this enough. I just thought … what better way to talk about it than to show the world how tough it is to travel with a passport like mine?” But, she added, it goes beyond traveling for pleasure. “There’s so much at stake,” she said. “People have missed opportunities to go abroad for meetings, for conferences … I know of someone who lost his mom because they couldn’t get her visa to a (different) country in time for her to get surgery done. That is a life-changing event.” Before beginning the journey, Asinobi drew up contingency plans in case of delays or missed connections, but days before setting out, she says one country on her route didn’t give her a visa, which meant fewer options if anything went wrong along the way. She began her record attempt from Antarctica on March 19, and then flew to Chile, and on to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, where her flight to Paris was cancelled due to the closure of the UK’s Heathrow Airport after a fire at a nearby substation. That led to a two-hour delay and reroute to Spain, where she missed her connecting flight and instead flew to Egypt. She the flew on to Dubai, where she says she wasn’t allowed to board for Perth, Australia, after being told at the gate that the authorities needed to re-confirm her visa. “This is the issue that we’re trying to highlight” she told CNN at her homecoming event in Lagos, Nigeria. “I stood there and watched everyone board that flight … I was there until I saw them shut the flight and I saw the flight actually take off. It was very heartbreaking.” Despite knowing she couldn’t break the record, after receiving confirmation that her visa was valid, Asinobi took the next available flight to Australia — choosing Sydney to complete the trip, saying the most important thing is that she chose to finish. She says the process taught her the importance of “Surrendering to faith and … to the unpredictability of things and just embracing the uncertainties.” Raising awareness around passport privilege was her primary goal, but Asinobi was also attempting to gain another world record: most signatures on a single piece of travel memorabilia — the Nigerian flag she took with her on the journey. Asinobi says she got over 600 signatures on the flag, and once certified, she will be an official Guinness World Record holder. She says she intends to continue having conversations about passport privilege and inequality “with the people who are the biggest stakeholders in this issue: the government,” citing a need for better diplomatic relations so people from developing countries don’t miss out on career and educational opportunities.",,0.20891568064689636
"As a child growing up in northern Nigeria, Dr. Funmi Adewara experienced a severe hand injury that required multiple surgeries and frequent hospital visits. These visits exposed her to the harsh realities of the country’s healthcare system. “I remember sitting in overcrowded waiting rooms, watching doctors stretched thin, unable to meet the needs of so many patients,” Adewara recalls. This formative experience ignited her passion for transforming healthcare in Africa. Growing up with a mother who worked as a nurse, Adewara’s understanding of healthcare challenges deepened through her mother’s stories. “I knew early on that healthcare wasn’t a privilege — it was a necessity, and I wanted to be part of changing the system,” she explains. After training as a physician, Adewara worked for 15 years in the UK’s National Health Service before founding the telemedicine platform Mobihealth in 2017. Since its launch, Mobihealth has impacted thousands of lives, connecting patients with doctors and healthcare professionals across Nigeria and beyond. The platform has 20 integrated telehealth clinics that offer remote consultations, diagnostics, and access to specialist care via digital health tools. Located primarily in Nigeria, these clinics are accessible to patients through various subscription plans, and are often financed through partnerships with global donor organizations and private donors. In addition to the clinics, Mobihealth has partnerships with over 200 hospitals, labs, and pharmacies, Adewara says. The company has earned global recognition, including a $1 million grant from the US Trade and Development Agency in 2022. Adewara was also one of the World Bank’s seven 2020 SDGs & Her award winners, selected from over 2,400 entries worldwide. Connecting rural patients Across sub-Saharan Africa, millions struggle to access basic healthcare. According to the World Health Organization, the region bears 25% of the global disease burden but has only 3% of the world’s healthcare workers. “In rural Africa, a trip to the nearest hospital can mean the difference between life and death,” says Adewara. Mobihealth’s latest initiative offers healthcare for $1 a month for rural and underserved populations. It allows Africans in the diaspora — and global supporters — to sponsor essential services like doctor consultations, diagnostic tests and access to telemedicine clinics. The scheme is not solely based on donations; individuals can also subscribe to the service for themselves. “Healthcare systems across Africa are under immense pressure,” Adewara explains. “Our initiative is a direct response, using technology to connect rural patients with doctors thousands of miles away.” For Adewara, Mobihealth’s telemedicine platform is not a temporary fix; it represents the future of healthcare in Africa. “This is about creating a resilient, sustainable and inclusive system, where people, no matter where they are, can access the care they need,” she says. “Telemedicine brings doctors to people, wherever they may be. By integrating AI and remote monitoring, we are improving the speed and accuracy of care, saving lives in the process,” she adds. A number of African companies provide telemedicine services, but researchers have pointed out that there are obstacles that could hinder the growth of telemedicine in the continent. Rural areas can have an unreliable electricity supply and poor internet connectivity, and there is often a lack of government policies and funding around virtual healthcare. “A healthcare system for the future” Adewara envisions scaling her company’s model to reach millions more across Africa, particularly in countries like Ghana, Kenya and Ivory Coast. “Our work is just beginning,” she says. “We are building a healthcare system for the future — one that is resilient, inclusive and capable of meeting Africa’s growing population’s needs.” However, partnerships are crucial to achieving this vision. “We can’t do this alone. Our collaborations with the African diaspora, hospitals, governments, and international organizations allow us to reach more people and ensure that healthcare is affordable, efficient and accessible,” Adewara adds.",,0.24340671300888062
"There’s excitement bubbling in Kigali, Rwanda, ahead of the Global AI Summit on Africa, which opens today, promising economic opportunities and innovation. Not least because of last week’s announcement from Cassava Technologies, a tech firm founded by Zimbabwean telecoms billionaire Strive Masiyiwa, that it would be building Africa’s first “artificial intelligence factory,” in partnership with leading AI chipmaker Nvidia. Nvidia’s supercomputers, which use graphic processing units, or GPUs, (the chips that often power AI), will be deployed at Cassava’s data centers in South Africa from as early as June, before being rolled out across the company’s other facilities in Egypt, Kenya, Morocco and Nigeria. Africa has fallen behind the global AI boom due in part to a lack of computing power. Analysis from Zindi, a community of 80,000 AI builders across 52 African countries, found that only 5% of Africa’s AI practitioners have access to computational power for research and innovation. Better access to GPUs will help to “drive the AI revolution” across the continent, says Alex Tsado, founder and director of Alliance4AI, a non-profit that helps African institutions adopt emerging technologies. Currently, there are no big GPU clusters in Africa and this is holding innovators back: “If you don’t have access to GPUs, it takes you many more hours, if not days, to build the same solutions (or AI systems) than it would take someone else who is in a place where they do have access (like the US or Europe),” he tells CNN. Related article
      ‘We don’t want to leave anyone behind,’ says Google’s Alex Okosi on the company’s drive to cut data costs in Africa “People start to see more reasons to gather data, because now they can process it; people start to see more reasons to train talent, because now there’s GPUs … (It) triggers the ecosystem to accelerate all the progress that they’ve already been making.” While Cassava is yet to divulge details of its deployment plan, it said in a press release that Nvidia’s GPU-based supercomputers will enable faster AI model training and that the data centers will ensure businesses and researchers have access to the AI computing power required to build, train, scale and deploy AI in a secure environment. “Our AI factory provides the infrastructure for this innovation to scale, empowering African businesses, startups and researchers with access to cutting-edge AI infrastructure to turn their bold ideas into real-world breakthroughs — and now, they don’t have to look beyond Africa to get it,” said Masiyiwa in the press release. Democratizing AI The high cost of hardware relative to income levels in Africa has been one of the main barriers to AI adoption. Some of Nvidia’s most powerful GPUs sell for as much as $40,000. According to AI4D, an African AI development program, the price of buying a GPU in Kenya represents 75% of GDP per capita, making it 31 times more expensive than one in Germany, in relative terms. This has led to a heavy reliance on foreign cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure – but these too are expensive, since it costs more, and takes longer, to transmit data between geographical regions. For Zindi’s network of AI builders, the development of local data centers with Nvidia GPU-powered supercomputers will be a “game-changer,” according to Celina Lee, its CEO and co-founder. “By establishing Africa-based AI infrastructure, ‘Zindians’ would benefit from more affordable compute resources, faster access to AI tools, and lower latency, making it easier to develop and deploy AI models efficiently,” she says. Use of Nvidia’s cutting-edge technology – the same that is used by OpenAI, Tesla, Meta, Google and other tech giants – will be a great equalizer, she adds: “This would democratize AI development, strengthen local AI ecosystems, and drive innovation across industries like agriculture, healthcare, and financial services, enabling more homegrown solutions tailored to Africa’s unique challenges.” Related article
      It costs more to send money to sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere else in the world: these companies are trying to change that It could also help to increase Africa’s representation in global AI training datasets. Currently, African languages and dialects are underrepresented due to a lack of data and there are often biases in training data, such as facial recognition systems that struggle with darker skin tones. “With increased access to AI infrastructure, African practitioners could train models using local datasets that better represent diverse demographics, economic systems, and environments,” says Lee. Tsado notes that there are still questions around how Cassava will overcome infrastructure challenges when building the factories – for instance Africa’s unreliable power grids, which have put people off doing this earlier. And beyond access to GPUs there are still challenges with African end users running AI models efficiently because of their reliance on lower-grade smartphones with limited access to internet apps, says Lee. But both agree that Cassava’s move is a big step in the right direction. “This is a very welcome boost that Africa’s big tech is finally joining the African AI communities … and spending some money on GPUs,” says Tsado. “Strive (Masiyiwa)’s announcement is the first big public commitment that’s been made, and it can trigger other people like him to do the same.”",,0.23619648814201355
"Nigerian Afro-pop sensation Yemi Alade has history with the Grammys. She’s featured on a Grammy-nominated album by Beyoncé and a Grammy-winning one by Beninese-French star Angelique Kidjo; but despite her popularity in Africa and her multilingual songs, Alade has yet to win a solo Grammy. On February 2, that could change, with her song “Tomorrow” nominated in the Best African Music Performance category. For Alade, her latest nomination is particularly special. “This time around it was for my own song, it was for my own crown,” she told CNN. A post shared by CNN Africa (@cnnafrica) “Tomorrow” features on Alade’s sixth studio album “Rebel Queen,” which the Recording Academy said “solidifies her reputation as “Mama Africa” — the title of a previous Alade album and a term associated with iconic South African singer Miriam Makeba. Alade first found fame with her 2014 single “Johnny,” which in 2019 made her the first Nigerian female artist to hit 100 million views on YouTube. She has also recorded the song in Portuguese, Swahili, and French. She was inspired to record the French version by hearing her francophone African fans singing it word for word at her shows and thought that would show them her appreciation. As she began to tour Europe, she recalls the song became one of the pillars of her career. “Paris is one of the cities that opened its borders to my music, and I fell in love with French even more,” Alade told CNN. “I wanted to communicate, so I decided to make versions of my songs (in other languages). That’s how the love story with languages started off.” “My own superwoman” Alade was born in Abia State, southeastern Nigeria, to a Yoruba father and an Igbo mother, and historically, “intertribal relationships were frowned on,” she explained. As a teen growing up in Lagos, she and her friends were also immersed in African American culture listening to rap music and making mix tapes. That context played a key role in Alade’s development as an artist and intentionality became paramount, from her lyrics to her album titles. “King of Queens,” “Woman of Steel,” “Mama Africa,” “Empress”, and “Rebel Queen” all speak of her struggles as a female artist in the industry, women’s empowerment and the unification of Africans across the world. “I needed to be my own superwoman. I think that spirit became what you see today,” she said. Rebel Queen mixes genres like R&B and pop with dancehall, highlife, and amapiano, with Alade singing in English, French, Igbo, Yoruba, and Swahili. It is the climax of a decade-long musical career that has taken her on a rich cultural journey. “My love for Africa just genuinely grows,” she said. “I do not do this with an agenda. When I travel, I see the different cultures, I easily accept it, appreciate it, from the food to the language to the way of life. In every country I go to there’s something that’s culturally appealing.” Staying independent Alade has become known as a champion of African culture and for her international collaborations. She featured in Beyoncé’s 2020 musical film and visual album “Black is King,” and on her song “Don’t Jealous Me” from the album “The Lion King: The Gift.” A post shared by CNN Africa (@cnnafrica) New album “Rebel Queen” features Ziggy Marley on the song “Peace and Love” and Kidjo on “African Woman.” The latter, Alade says, was one of the most challenging and fulfilling songs to make because she got to know one of her heroes even better, describing Kidjo as “my musical mother.” Despite her growing success, Alade has chosen to remain independent, working with the same management team for over a decade in the music industry and recording with Effyzzie Music Group, rather than a major label. “Other labels have made offers and we haven’t accepted, not because they’re not good enough. (But) if your goals are not in alignment with the goals that I’ve set for myself for over 10 years, then we should not be in the same boat. If you have a team of two people, trust me, that’s all you need,” she added.",,0.29184386134147644
"While fans worldwide know him for his chart-topping hits, behind the scenes, Nigerian Afro-dancehall artist Patoranking has set out to change the lives of one million young people by 2035. Born Patrick Nnaemeka Okorie, Patoranking rose from the slums of Ebute Metta, Lagos, to become one of Nigeria’s most versatile and successful musicians. Blending reggae, dancehall and Afrobeats, he has captivated audiences globally. However, beyond his musical talents, Patoranking is working to uplift African youth. “I’ve always had a picture of what my family and community should look like,” he told CNN. “Coming from a place where the chances of making it were slim, I knew I had to step up — not just for myself but for those around me.” Overcoming adversity through music Growing up in a slum, Patoranking faced harsh realities early on. His father, a “petty trader,” struggled to make ends meet. Higher education seemed out of reach, so instead, Patoranking turned to his natural gift — music. “I was influenced by the ghetto sounds of Daddy Showkey, Baba Fryo, and Tuface. Music was a way to express the struggles of my people, and I wanted to be the voice of the voiceless,” he recalled. His breakthrough came in 2013 when Nigerian singer Timaya took him under his wing  collaborating on and releasing the hit track “Alubarika” on Timaya’s record label. The following year, Patoranking’s song “Girlie O” earned him a spot on MTV Base’s Official Naija Top 10 chart, as well as numerous awards. Giving back to the community Despite his meteoric rise, Patoranking never lost sight of his roots. In 2018, he launched the Patoranking Foundation, which aims to help one million youth with initiatives focused on education, sports and community development. “One of the dreams I had growing up was to be a footballer,” he said. “Since I couldn’t achieve that, I want to create opportunities for others.” As part of this vision, Patoranking is building sports facilities in underserved communities, providing safe spaces for young people to play, learn and connect. The first was in his hometown, Ebute Metta, an area historically plagued by gang clashes. “This is a genuine sports center, and by the grace of God, we’ve been able to build something that unifies our people,” he said. A vision for Africa’s future Over the next five years, Patoranking plans to build 100 such facilities across Africa, creating safe havens for young people in slums and marginalized communities. His foundation also supports education and vocational training. “For me, philanthropy is personal. Before I became Patoranking, I prayed to God, saying, ‘If you put me in a position to make money, I want to touch lives,’” he said. While the singer’s initial aspirations to become a professional footballer led him to build community soccer fields, it was his passion for technology and the financial barriers he faced in pursuing an education that drove him to make his biggest philanthropic investment. “I’ve always wanted to become an information technologist, but my parents were not financially able to send me to university,” he said.

      ‘I wanted to communicate’: Grammy-nominated Yemi Alade embraces multiple languages and genres to showcase Africa to the world He launched the Sky Level Initiative to provide access to advanced technology training and education for 170 children in Ebonyi State in southeastern Nigeria. In partnership with the African Leadership University (ALU), one of the continent’s leading tech and skills training institutions, in 2020 Patoranking launched a scholarship to help young people further their careers in tech and entrepreneurship. The program began with 10 scholars, and this year, the Patoranking Foundation invested $500,000 more into the program, allowing 40 additional scholars to alleviate the financial burden of pursuing their dreams. “Being a Patoranking Scholar gave me the opportunity to focus on what I want to do for my country and my continent,” Hardness Range, a 2024 graduate of ALU told CNN. Fred Swaniker, founder of the ALU, said the scholarship “Creates tremendous opportunities, because young people tend to be more creative, more entrepreneurial, hungry, and passionate. I believe that many of the world’s problems will be solved by harnessing the power of African youth.” Last year, Patoranking was appointed UN Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador for Africa, tasked with championing youth innovation and enterprise development. As he continues to break boundaries in the music industry and beyond, he remains optimistic about the future of the next generation. “Anything they want to achieve is achievable,” he said.",,0.27650707960128784
"It’s a familiar, beloved scene for millions across America: snow drifting outside and Christmas music playing while families decorate their homes with string lights, stockings and a star atop the tree. But few know exactly where those iconic holiday items come from. Most of the time, they hail from just one city in China’s Zhejiang province: Yiwu, nicknamed “Christmas Town,” which supplies nearly 90% of all decorative Christmas goods used in the United States, according to state media. And many of those products can be traced back to Yiwu’s wholesale market — the biggest in the world. It’s a labyrinthine complex measuring nearly 1,000 acres, the equivalent of roughly 750 football fields. Inside, foreign buyers browse narrow corridors overflowing with merchandise, ranging from piano-playing musical Santa dolls to artificial Christmas trees — as well as countless other items destined for American homes, including “Make America Great Again” hats, massage guns and foldable camping chairs. But these days, there’s an undercurrent of anxiety. These vendors are on the front lines of global trade — and are now grappling with triple-digit tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which have sent shockwaves across the world and upended relationships forged over decades between the US and China, two superpower economies. America’s overall tariffs on China now exceed a staggering 145%, the highest trade penalties imposed by the US in nearly a century, with Trump’s most recent “reciprocal” tariffs on Chinese imports coming after earlier rounds related to fentanyl. For many vendors, the measures have already cost them customers, slashed their profits and forced them to pivot to other markets. When CNN visited the market earlier this week, many voiced both concern and bewilderment at Trump’s actions, but also desire for a peaceful resolution as they pick up the pieces of their disrupted businesses. “Some of our long-term clients have stopped dealing with us and we are all very sad,” said Ran Hongyan, 43, who has been selling Christmas decorations for 15 years. After the tariffs hit, she tried offering her American customers a discount to save the relationship, but it didn’t work. Eight out of ten canceled their contracts this year, representing a loss of more than $135,000, she said. Ran said the US exports made up only a portion of her total clientele, but they’re not just numbers on a screen or an accounting ledger. Many were longtime partners. She had met one American customer at a trade fair in China years ago, and they had worked together for nearly a decade; he even traveled to visit her factory where the products were made. “Because of the tariff issue, he said he had no choice but to cancel it this year and see what happens later,” she told CNN, standing amid rows of reindeer plushies and festive teddy bears in her small store. “We have been working together for a long time.” Countries are spending less. That’s bad for Yiwu Much of President Trump’s tariff rhetoric has been about restoring US factory jobs that he says had been destroyed by bad trade deals. But it’s difficult to see a future where the kind of products on display at Yiwu could be made by American hands — unless consumers are willing to pay much more for something as ubiquitous and currently inexpensive as plastic Christmas ornaments. The second-biggest exporter of Christmas decorations to the US is Cambodia, where factory wages are even lower than China, but Trump also imposed 49% tariffs on the small Southeast Asian nation, before the recent 90-day pause. The city of Yiwu is relatively small by Chinese standards, home to fewer than two million people, but it has an outsized footprint in global trade. Last year, it sent $81 billion of goods overseas, of which about $11.5 billion went to the US, according to local customs data. This massive impact is clear from the moment you land in the city. As you step off the plane, the boarding bridge connected to the airport is plastered with English ads that read: “China goods! Do global business in Yiwu!” When CNN visited the wholesale market, it was still bursting with activity. After all, the US is currently alone in slapping universal tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy. The multi-story, multi-block complex boasts different types of goods on each floor, with coffee shops and snack stalls scattered throughout. Everywhere you turn, there is an explosion of color and sound, with an estimated 70,000 stalls crammed inside, according to local authorities. But the escalating trade war is already making a mark. CNN saw buyers from various countries perusing the booths and negotiating contracts with sellers, but there wasn’t a single American in sight. Shopkeepers were on edge, too — with many declining to speak and cautious of local Chinese officials wandering the market. Even vendors who don’t sell to the US are nervous. Trump may have delayed his so-called reciprocal tariffs on other nations besides China, prompting many to suspend their own counter-measures, but talks are still ongoing, and there’s no telling if the announced tariffs might be reinstated. Many economists, even Trump allies, are warning a global recession could still take place if the trade war continues. The back-and-forth means that the world’s economies remain in flux, with consumers potentially tightening their purse strings and reassessing where they’re spending their money. That could spell deep trouble for the people of Yiwu, whose livelihoods depend on overseas customers, particularly in the run-up to Christmas. Li Xinyao has been working at her family’s imitation flower business at Yiwu market since it was established in 1993, selling plastic bouquets of roses, sunflowers, daisies and more. Though they don’t currently have any American customers, their revenue has still taken a hit since the trade war kicked off. “Even though we think China will be better (and recover), but the United States is still the best country in the world, the richest,” she said. “The Americans always impact the world. When they start the trade war, all the people will worry about that, and our customers will maybe hold on (orders).” The turbulent global economy could also hurt her sales, since decorations, like plastic flowers, could be first on the chopping block for clients needing to cut expenditures, she said. “If we cannot lead a happy life, who will care about decorations?” she asked. Pivoting from the US For many other vendors, whose customer base is concentrated in the US, Trump’s trade war means they will now need to look for other opportunities. In some ways, this pivot has been happening for years on a national level. The idea of decoupling, a scenario where two countries have virtually no trade or investment, has been bandied about in US-China circles for years, though such a historic rupture would cause enormous pain for both of the deeply intertwined economies. Tensions have been rising since the US-China trade war during Trump’s first term, and China has been quietly bracing for a showdown in the years since. Since 2018, Beijing has diversified its supply chains and expanded trade relations with the rest of the world, thereby reducing the share of US exports. China’s exports to the US made up 19.2% of its total overseas shipments in 2018 – but dropped to 14.7% in 2024, according to official figures. This means China now relies less on US businesses than it did before, an attitude the Yiwu sellers are adopting too. “I am now taking all goods that are halted by my US customers to the EU route. I will push all these goods to our EU customers,” said 39-year-old Nie Ziqin, who sells Halloween decorations. Up to half of her exports used to go to the US. Like Ran, she had cultivated trade relationships with “old customers for many years,” she said. But now, many of those orders have been suspended, even though they were negotiated before the tariffs were announced. Although her sales have dropped “significantly,” she voiced optimism about her other options. “I still have the domestic market, and the EU market. I am also doing cross-border e-commerce online,” she said, gesturing to the walls of ghostly masks, pumpkin lanterns, dancing ghouls and giant eyeballs around her. “Last year, we had already started to design products that (we) could sell to the Chinese domestic market.” Some of the vendors praised China’s response to the trade war, echoing sentiments expressed on China’s tightly controlled social media, where online users vented anger toward the US and supported Beijing’s firm stance against Trump’s tariffs. Last week Beijing raised tariffs on US goods to 125%, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping saying his nation was “not afraid.” Officials indicated Beijing would not raise rates further since it would be meaningless to continue escalating. “Our government is doing good in these things,” said Li, the imitation flower seller. But that doesn’t lessen their fear, as they brace for impact and worry about what the trade war could mean for Yiwu and the families who live there. Li, the plastic flower seller, worries about how the state of the world will affect her six-year-old daughter “every day,” she said, adding that Chinese people “always worry about the next generation.” And even as a history buff, she remains confused about why Trump would launch such a trade war in the first place. “We want world peace. From my perspective, I really don’t understand why they would do this,” she said. She and the other vendors all voiced hope that the two countries’ leaders can reach an agreement and end the tit-for-tat tariffs that have plunged their lives and businesses into uncertainty. But as the trade war drags on, it’s not clear whether that relationship can be repaired — or whether it will ever look the same again, even if vendors eventually resume selling to their long-time customers. For some, the damage has already been done. “When we do daily shopping, if we want to buy a bag or buy some daily necessities, we will now start considering whether these products are imported from the United States,” said Ran, the Christmas decorations seller. And if those goods are American-made: “I will definitely choose not to buy them.” CNN’s Martha Zhou contributed reporting.",,0.3102112114429474
"US stocks were mixed Thursday as President Donald Trump touted trade deal progress with Europe and China and investors digested a threat from the president to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Stocks initially wavered Thursday morning after Trump called for Powell’s “termination” for not cutting interest rates fast enough — a criticism he has levied multiple times in a long-standing feud between the president and the Fed chair. However, markets shrugged off the jab at Powell and got a boost in the afternoon as Trump said there will “100%” be a trade deal with the European Union and a “very good deal” with China. Investors have been on alert for progress in trade talks during the 90-day pause on most “reciprocal” tariffs. “Oh, there will be a trade deal, 100%,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. “Of course there will be a trade deal. They want to make one very much. We’re going to make a trade deal. I fully expect it. But it’ll be a fair deal.” Trump also said he’s not worried about US allies turning to China due to his tariffs. “Nobody can compete with us,” Trump said. “Nobody.” “I think that you will see we’ll make a very good deal with China,” he added. The Dow fell 527 points, or 1.33%. The broader S&P 500 held on to its gains and edged higher by 0.13% after dipping into the red in the morning. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.13% after fluctuating between gains and losses. All three major indexes were coming off back-to-back days of losses and finished the week in the red. Trading in the US will be closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. Dow futures had dropped steeply Thursday morning as Trump posted on social media lambasting Powell. The Dow was also dragged lower by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which sank 22.38% after the health care giant cut its profit forecast for this year. The Dow is weighted by share prices, and UnitedHealth has a significant influence on the index’s performance. Related article
      Trump blasts Fed Chair Powell, saying his ‘termination cannot come fast enough’ “Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete ‘mess!’” Trump posted on social media. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump on Thursday told reporters at the White House that Powell would “leave” if he asked him to. Trump then ignored a follow-up question on whether he is trying to remove Powell. “Fed independence is more important than ever at a time when there is risk to underlying inflation and inflation expectations from Trump tariff inflation, and global portfolio reallocation out of the US at the margin amid erratic US decision-making,” said Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, in a Thursday note. Powell said Wednesday at an economic event in Chicago that Trump’s tariffs are unlike anything in modern history, with the potential to stoke inflation and drag on economic growth, complicating the Fed’s job and the outlook for the economy. That led to a rapid selloff on Wednesday, with the Dow closing 700 points lower, or 1.73%. The S&P 500 fell 2.24% and the Nasdaq Composite closed 3.07% lower. “We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension,” Powell said. ‘Trade policy uncertainty is literally off the charts’ Investors this week also digested earnings results for the first quarter. Companies on earnings calls have said that uncertainty makes it extraordinarily difficult to plan ahead. United Airlines (UAL) this week offered two versions of guidance: one for a recession scenario, and one for a non-recession, “stable” scenario. “It’s really difficult to have conviction today with the humongous uncertainty in the economy and in trade policy,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management. “Recent developments are a reminder that market swings are likely until there is greater certainty over the outlook for tariffs,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Thursday note. A new International Monetary Fund report to be released next week will include “notable markdowns” in economic growth forecasts, Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said in a speech Thursday.

The chipmaker on Tuesday said it would take a $5.5 billion hit because the US government imposed fresh export restrictions on the the sale of its H20 chips to China. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), another chipmaker, said in a regulatory filing this week it could take an $800 million hit because of similar export restrictions. Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a Thursday note that there has been “much angst in the market” since Trump unveiled his plan for “reciprocal” tariffs on April 2. “This week were the first shots fired in the trade war in the tech world as the White House has essentially blocked Nvidia from selling its key H20 chips to China,” Ives said. Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a note: “We are staying sway from Big Tech as we believe that it could be used as a leverage in trade talks.” Stock futures had gained overnight as investors enjoyed a moment of relative calm. Trump posted on social media Wednesday afternoon that he had met with the Japanese delegation on trade. “Big Progress!” Trump wrote. Trump on Thursday morning said he had a “very productive call” with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday. “Likewise, I met with the highest level Japanese Trade Representatives,” Trump wrote. “It was a very productive meeting. Every Nation, including China, wants to meet! Today, Italy!” The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.326%, up from Wednesday.

"Less than a year into Donald Trump’s first trade war with China, Chinese leader Xi Jinping made a high-profile visit to an unassuming factory in Ganzhou, an industrial city nestled among rolling hills in the country’s southeast. Touring its exhibition hall in 2019, Xi examined row upon row of unremarkable gray metal blocks and declared to his entourage of Communist Party officials: “Rare earths are a vital strategic resource.” Nearly six years on, China’s dominance of the rare earths supply chain has emerged as among its most potent tools in a renewed trade war with the United States president. The minerals – used to power everything from iPhones to electric vehicles – are vital components for the kinds of advanced technology that will define the future. And unlike tariffs, it’s a front where Trump has little room to retaliate in kind. Rare earths are a group of 17 elements that are more abundant than gold and can be found in many countries, including the United States. But they’re difficult, costly and environmentally polluting to extract and process. For decades, the US and other countries have been dependent on Beijing’s supply of these processed metals. China accounts for 61% of global mined rare earth production, but its control over the processing stage is 92% of the global output, according to the International Energy Agency. On April 4, after years of veiled warnings, the Chinese government placed export restrictions on seven types of rare earth minerals, as part of its retaliation against Trump’s initial 34% “reciprocal” tariffs on Chinese goods. The new rules require all companies to secure government permission to export the seven minerals as well as associated products, such as magnets. Magnets made of rare earths enable smaller, more efficient motors and generators used in smartphones, car and jet engines, and MRI machines. They are also essential components in a range of big-ticket weapons, from F-35 stealth fighter jets to nuclear-powered attack submarines. “It’s China showing that it can exert incredible economic might by being strategic … and surgical and really hitting American industry right where it hurts,” said Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. On Tuesday, Trump ordered a probe into potential tariffs on critical minerals, a broader category of resources that include rare earth elements, to evaluate the impact of these imports on America’s security and resilience. “The dependence of the United States on imports and the vulnerability of our supply chains raises the potential for risks to national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience,” Trump said in an executive order. Since the first Trump administration, the US has been trying to play catch-up and build up its own domestic rare earths supply chain. Three American rare earth industry companies told CNN that they are in the process of expanding production capacities and sourcing materials from US allies and partners. But those efforts will take years to meet the enormous demand from key US industries. Suspended orders For now, the impact of Beijing’s export controls is being swiftly felt on the ground. John Ormerod, founder of rare earth magnet consultancy JOC, told CNN that shipments of rare earth magnets belonging to at least five American and European companies have been halted in China since the imposition of the order. “They were taken by surprise so there’s a lot of confusion on their side and they needed clarification from the authorities of what’s required (to obtain the required export licenses),” he said. Joshua Ballard, CEO of USA Rare Earth, said the export controls focus on “heavy” rare earths, which are 98% controlled by China. (Heavy rare earths are less common, harder to process and more valuable.) This means that companies must now seek Beijing’s approval to deliver these critical materials to key American industries, he added. “Right now, literally these exports are being suspended,” Ballard said. “We don’t hold a lot of back stock of this in inventory here in the US … This is China’s best play. They don’t have much leverage when it comes to tariffs on us, but they sure do have leverage here.” The export controls not only target single materials but also alloys and products where the elements are contained even in minimal quantities, said Thomas Kruemmer, director of the Singapore-based mineral and metal supply chain firm Ginger International Trade and Investment. “A lot of exports now fall under this licensing system,” he added, noting that some delays are expected as exporters navigate the new system. Decades in the making China got an early start in rare earth extraction, beginning in the 1950s, according to state media, but the industry only really began to develop in the late 1970s. During that time, China combined its low labor costs and relatively lax environmental standards with the adoption of foreign technologies, according to Stan Trout, founder of the rare earths and magnetic materials consultancy Spontaneous Materials. “Much of the technology that they brought in was developed here in the US, or in Japan, or in Europe,” he said. “And over time, I’m sure they’ve made improvements to it.” As the country’s rare earth production increased, Beijing gradually understood the strategic importance of the minerals. “There was a recognition that this could be a very important technology for them to master,” Trout added. In 1992, during a visit to one of the country’s main rare earth production hubs in Inner Mongolia, Deng Xiaoping, the former Chinese leader who spearheaded the country’s economic reforms, famously said: “While there is oil in the Middle East, China has rare earths.” Today, China has fulfilled Deng’s vision by dominating the entire supply chain for the materials. While labor costs are now higher, China’s control of the industry has been cemented because of its “willingness to invest in the technology, the R&D, and automation” in an industry that is highly capital-intensive, said Ormerod. There were once American companies making these rare earth magnets. But Ormerod noted that they gradually exited the business as lower-cost Chinese alternatives emerged. “We’ve lost the know-how, we’ve lost the human resource capability and it’s a very capital-intensive operation,” he said. Now, it is difficult to compete with the “Chinese price,” because of the country’s greater economies of scale, as well as government incentives that gave them an additional edge, Ormerod added. Between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals, according to a US Geological Survey report this year. Challenge and opportunity for the US The latest export controls are not the first time Beijing has leveraged its dominance in the industry. In 2010, China halted shipments of rare earths to Japan for nearly two months over a territorial dispute. In late 2023, Beijing imposed a ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies. Beijing has also curbed exports of other critical minerals that are vital to the economy and global supply chains. Experts and industry insiders said China’s export controls have left the rest of the world with very limited alternatives. But the US is working to fill the gap. Since 2020, the US Department of Defense has awarded more than $439 million to establish domestic rare earth element supply chains. And it has set a goal to develop a sustainable, mine-to-magnet supply chain capable of supporting all US defense requirements by 2027. Some American companies see China’s export controls as an opportunity to expedite domestic production and push for a stronger supply chain outside China. Nicholas Myers, CEO of Phoenix Tailings, a Massachusetts-based rare earth processing start-up, said his company has developed technology to refine rare earth minerals with “zero waste, zero emissions” into metals and metal alloys, sourcing the materials from domestic ores as well as Canada and Australia. His company currently produces 40 metric tons of rare earth metals and alloys per year and aims to scale up to 400 tons with a new facility in New Hampshire. “It’s all domestic processing. We don’t rely on anything from China,” he said. “The United States absolutely has the capabilities to be able to produce the rare earth metals at the timelines that we really need it. We just have to make sure that all the customers, all the policymakers are focused on supporting the industry to really scale up,” Myers added. American businesses are making inroads in parts of the supply chain too. USA Rare Earth is building a magnet plant in Texas, aiming to produce 5,000 tons of rare earth magnets annually; it also owns a deposit rich in heavy rare earths in West Texas, including all the minerals on China’s latest export control list, according to its CEO Ballard. (The deposit is also rich in gallium, a critical material banned by China for export to the US in December.) But the company is still working on the processing technology to extract minerals from the rocks, Ballard said. “The question is how do we do this faster? How do we unlock these assets that we have in the US, as few as they are? We need to unlock what we have and build as quickly as we can,” he said. After years of talk, American companies may finally have the impetus they need to do the difficult work of re-establishing the industry for extracting and processing raw materials that is key to winning a tech race with China.

"Shares of Boeing fell Tuesday following a report that China has halted the delivery of all its jets to airlines in the country as part of  an escalating trade war that has enveloped the world’s two biggest economies. Boeing (BA), a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell in early trading after a Bloomberg report that Chinese authorities had ordered its airlines not to take any further Boeing deliveries. Shares were down 1% by midday. Neither Chinese authorities, Boeing nor the White House immediately responded to CNN requests for comment on the report, ﻿although President Donald Trump said in a social media post Tuesday that China “just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will ‘not take possession’ of fully committed to aircraft.” The move would be a blow not just to Boeing, America’s largest exporter, but also to the US economy, the world’s largest. As Trump has levied tariffs on trading partners - including at least 145% on many Chinese products – other nations have retaliated as well, in some cases sparking a tit-for-tat that now threatens to hurt companies, manufacturing and jobs around the world. Trump’s acrimony toward China has been particularly acute, with a spiraling trade war with that nation threatening everything from American farmers to iPhone shipments – even as confusion has mounted over exemptions and delays. Boeing is particularly vulnerable to the current trade disputes between America and its trading partners. Unlike many multinational companies, Boeing builds all of its planes at US factories before sending nearly two-thirds of its commercial planes to customers outside the United States. And Boeing is a major part of the US economy, contributing an estimated $79 billion and supporting 1.6 million jobs both directly and indirectly. It has nearly 150,000 US employees of its own. Boeing has been struggling for six years, racking up $51 billion in operating losses since 2018, the last year it reported an annual profit. China is the world’s largest market for aircraft purchases, with Boeing’s own recent analysis estimating that Chinese airlines are expected to purchase 8,830 new planes over the next 20 years. Boeing was already dealing with a drop in sales for years in China, even before the introduction of tariffs. China has put tariffs of 125% on all imports from the United States. Boeing’s jets cost tens of millions of dollars each, so tariffs that more than double the price would make them unaffordable to any Chinese customers even without any new limits on deliveries. Boeing has largely been shut out of the Chinese market since 2019. Part of that was due to the the trade tensions between China and the United States that started during the first Trump administration. Boeing took orders for 122 planes from Chinese customers in 2017 and 2018. In the six years since then, Boeing has only received orders for 28 planes, and that was mostly for freighters or from Chinese leasing companies, which could be buying them on behalf of airlines outside China. It has not reported a single order for a passenger jet from a Chinese airline. But the drop off wasn’t all due to trade tensions. Some was due to problems at Boeing itself, including the grounding of its best-selling 737 Max following two fatal crashes in late 2018 and early 2019. Deliveries to China came to a near halt after the second crash. That’s because aviation authorities around the world grounded jets in the wake of the disasters and China did not immediately allow for them to return to service even when countries cleared the plane to carry passengers in late 2020. Deliveries only started to rebound last year. Deliveries are crucial to Boeing, since that’s when it gets paid. The company builds the plane first and gets most of its payment after delivering the finished product. Choking off these deliveries is a particularly big blow for Boeing, which had a total of 55 planes in inventory at the end of 2024 that it has not been able to deliver to customers, primarily those in China and India, according to the company.",,0.21839861571788788
"Those shopping for a new smartphone or computer may be spared from tariff-induced sticker shock. At least, for now. President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on April 11 saying certain electronics — including computers, smartphones and some components — won’t be subject to the reciprocal tariffs imposed on imports from China. While tariffs on virtually all other products from China are now at least 145%, prices of smartphones and certain other devices should avoid completely skyrocketing, at least for a little while. But with comments from the Trump administration indicating an upcoming wave of tariffs on semiconductors — a critical part of the chips that power electronic devices — it’s still unclear if and when tech products could get more expensive in the US. Plus, the current exclusions aren’t expected to cover many everyday tech products that consumers are likely to buy more frequently than new phones — such as some charging cables and earbuds. That makes it challenging for shoppers to know what to expect, but also for tech companies to adjust their supply chains and shipments as demand potentially fluctuates due to tariff-induced price swings — all while keeping prices reasonable. “It’s completely impossible for any company to plan,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president of client devices for the International Data Corporation, a firm that tracks global shipments of tech devices. “So the best, the only thing they can do at the moment is… ship as many products as they can while the exemption lasts to the US.” Some reports indicate that companies may be doing just that. Apple’s India-based suppliers shipped a record number of iPhones to the US in March, nearly $2 billion worth, according to Reuters. PC shipments grew by 12.6% in the US during the first quarter of 2025 as vendors increased shipments ahead of potential tariffs, market research firm Gartner said in a press release Monday. ‘No tariff exception’ The exception is a major win for Apple, which relies on iPhone sales for most of its revenue — about $69 billion of its roughly $124 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2025 — and has much of its smartphone supply chain located in China. But the Trump administration has indicated that more tech tariffs are coming. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” when it comes to tariffs, adding that “there was no tariff exception” announced and these products are still subject to a 20% tariff on Chinese imports. The excepted products will be moved to a “different tariff bucket” as the administration examines the “whole electronics supply chain,” the post said. The Trump administration on Monday began investigating semiconductor imports to set the stage for tariffs. Kevin Hassett, national economic council director, said when speaking with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that “it was always the case” that semiconductors would be covered under a separate action rather than reciprocal tariffs. The exception came after Trump’s tariff policies resulted in a whirlwind couple of weeks for the stock market, with the S&P 500 having its worst week since 2020 earlier this month. But the stock market saw massive gains last week when Trump announced a 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs, a sign that investors were seeking a reprieve from his levies. The tech products that are — and aren’t — excepted The exclusions specifically mention smartphones, computers (described as “automatic data processing machines”), monitors, storage devices and various components that power those devices, including integrated circuits and transistors. But a host of other tech products don’t appear to be included in the exceptions, such as USB charging cables, portable battery packs, headphones and video game consoles, a public affairs officer for the US International Trade Commission said in response to a CNN inquiry about whether these products fall under the exceptions. But it’ll likely depend on which components are inside these devices and how they’re categorized. The US ITC also said computer mice and keyboards are covered under the exceptions, but added that US Customs and Border Protection has the final say on how imported goods are classified and whether they’re exempted from tariffs. “It’s a gray area,” said Dave Marcotte, a senior vice president and analyst with market research and consultancy firm Kantar. “This is where you get creative about describing your products when you move to Customs. If you look at the scheduling and say, ‘Okay, well, I have, I have peripherals. Are peripherals covered? Or (are) computer cables covered?’ Well, they’re the same thing.” Even before Trump specified these exclusions, some analysts had expected smaller items like charging cables and headphones to be among those most heavily impacted by tariffs. “I think the first things you’re going to see (are) the stuff we don’t really pay attention to, like… USB chargers and batteries and stuff that’s less than, say, $20, $25,” Marcotte said last week ahead of Trump’s exception on smartphones and other select tech products. “It’s going to be the small stuff.” Smaller companies don’t have the supply chain flexibility of a stalwart like Apple, for example, and the margins on cheaper items such as charging cables are much lower. That means these firms don’t have as much flexibility to absorb additional tariff costs and would likely have to pass it down to consumers to turn a profit. And many of these ancillary tech gadgets appear to be from China. When CNN searched Amazon for earbuds under $50, iPhone charging cables and portable battery packs, many of the top five results for each product either had China listed as the country of origin, or mentioned a manufacturer based in China. Some of the results didn’t name a country of origin, but other product pages from the same sellers listed products as coming from China. Trump also got rid of the “de minimis exemption,” which allowed packages valued at less than $800 to enter the US tax-free — another change that’s expected to impact the prices cheap goods from China. Price hikes on these smaller, cheaper items could feel more impactful to consumers in some cases since the difference in price may feel more drastic. “A $40 increase to an $80 increase looks a lot worse for a consumer than, say, a $1,200 to $1,500,” said Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys. What’s happens next Although some tech products got a break on certain reciprocal levies, new tariffs on semiconductors are expected to arrive in the “next month or two,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC News on Sunday. It’s part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to reduce US reliance on China while reshoring manufacturing. But tariffs or not, the chances of an American-made iPhone seem slim. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump believes iPhone production could move to the US, but higher labor costs and the logistics of shifting Apple’s massive production network to the other side of the world — further away from Asia, where many components would likely still be sourced — present major challenges. And it’s not just the components. Finding workers would be an issue, too. “It’s very hard to find skilled labor in the numbers they need,” Jeronimo said. Apple in February announced a $500 billion investment to expand its US operations. But that commitment is largely focused on building production facilities for Apple Intelligence servers and boosting education in manufacturing, not building iPhones. And while several tech leaders like chipmaking giants TSMC and Nvidia have announced major US expansions, the tech supply chain is largely expected to remain in China, says Jeronimo. Companies are more likely to shift some production to other regions, like the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, according to Jeronimo. Trump’s tariff policy is already seems to be impacting some tech product launches and shipments. The US smartphone market grew more than 5% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the IDC, partially driven by a “sense of urgency to buy before potential price increases,” the IDC’s research director for client devices Anthony Scarsella said in a Monday press release. Nintendo also postponed US preorders for its new Switch 2 game console in early April as it assesses the tariff situation. “You stockpile during a hurricane because it happens for five days,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at market research firm Forrester. “There is no pantry in the world that’s large enough where you can stockpile four years’ worth of trade policy uncertainty.”",,0.33095961809158325
"China has posted unexpectedly strong economic growth in the first three months of 2025, before the full force of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs took effect, and sent an upbeat message about how it plans to weather an ongoing trade war with Washington. Growth in China’s gross domestic product (GDP) hit 5.4% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That was considerably higher than the expectations of more than 50 economists surveyed by Reuters, who had predicted expansion of 5.1%, and continues a recent run of surprisingly strong export-driven growth seen at the end of 2024. “The national economy had a steady and good start, continuing the upward trend,” Sheng Laiyun, deputy director of the NBS, told a news conference. “However, we must also see that the current external environment is becoming more complex and severe, and the effective domestic demand growth momentum is insufficient.” Growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, is in the spotlight as it deals with the fallout of an escalating trade war with the United States. And that’s on top of the economic problems it has faced for years: a crisis in the property sector, the specter of falling prices and a reluctance among consumers to spend. The data announced by the NBS covers growth in the first quarter, a particularly eventful time for US-China trade relations. During that period, Trump imposed two rounds of tariffs totaling 20% on China related to fentanyl. The figures do not include the impact of Trump’s additional “reciprocal” tariffs on Chinese imports, which took effect in April. The overall tariffs on China now exceed a staggering 145%. Asked about the impact of the tariffs, Sheng noted that China opposes the US tariff barriers and “trade bullying.” While the tariffs will bring “certain pressure” to bear on the Chinese economy, they “cannot change the general trend of China’s continued long-term economic improvement,” he said. “China’s economic foundation is stable, resilient and has great potential, so we have the courage, ability and confidence to cope with external challenges and achieve the established development goals,” Sheng added. Consumer spending and production also beat expectations, with retail sales rising by 5.9% in March compared with the same month last year, and factory output expanding by 7.7% last month compared with 5.9% in the January to February period. Growth prospects downgraded Last month, Beijing set an ambitious target of “around 5%” growth for this year, in a defiant show of confidence in its export-driven economy. However, economists believe it will be tough to meet this target. This is in part because export growth has been particularly buoyant since the waning months of 2024, when overseas companies increased their orders in anticipation of tariffs to be imposed by Trump. Experts believe exports, which surged by 12.4% in March compared with the year before, will not be able to maintain that strong momentum in the coming months because of the triple-digit levies. “We think the tariff shock poses unprecedented challenges to China’s exports and will set forth major adjustment in the domestic economy as well,” UBS economists led by Tao Wang wrote in a Tuesday research note. They have downgraded their economic growth forecast for 2025 to 3.4% from 4%, with the assumption that the bilateral tariffs remain, and that Beijing will eventually announce additional stimulus measures. Last week, investment bank Goldman Sachs said the US tariffs will “significantly weigh” on the Chinese economy. It has downgraded its GDP growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 to 4% and 3.5%, respectively, from previous projections of 4.5% and 4%. Zichun Huang, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a Wednesday research note that the government is likely to announce more measures to strengthen domestic consumption in the coming months, which she said should be enough to keep growth above 4%. “The budget announced in March allows for a further ramp up in fiscal spending. And further monetary easing is likely to happen soon,” she said, referring to spending by government and moves by the central bank to make borrowing more accessible. Diversifying trade Like Chinese leaders at the opening of China’s parliament last month, Sheng has sought to project optimism in the country’s ability to stay the course, despite mounting trade pressure from the world’s largest economy and its mercurial president. Sheng pointed out to reporters that China has been diversifying its trading relationships beyond the US since the first trade war with the US. China’s exports to the US as a percentage of total overseas shipments dropped from 19.2% in 2018, to 14.7% in 2024, he added. “A diversified market pattern is taking shape, which also means that our dependence on a single export market in a certain country is declining,” he said. “Therefore, China’s foreign trade is relatively resilient. The just-released first-quarter foreign trade data also shows that despite the increase in external restrictions, exports still grew by 6.9%.” On Wednesday, Beijing named Li Chenggang to the position of international trade negotiation representative and vice commerce minister. He replaced Wang Shouwen, who had played a major role in trade negotiations during Trump’s first term. China is going on a global charm offensive to promote itself as a more politically and economically stable partner than the United States. Chinese leader Xi Jinping is currently on a week-long tour of Southeast Asia with that mission in mind. As a bloc, the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations overtook the US and the European Union as China’s largest export market in 2023. In meetings with Vietnam’s top leadership on Monday, Xi said the two countries should work together to maintain “the stability of the global free trade system and industrial and supply chains,” according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.

"US stocks fell Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are unprecedented in modern history, with effects that “remain highly uncertain.” The Dow tumbled 700 points, or 1.73%. The broader S&P 500 fell 2.24%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.07%. “The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated,” Powell said at an event in Chicago. “The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.” Wall Street has been mired in uncertainty as investors wrestle with the Trump administration’s back-and-forth on trade policy. Related article
      Fed Chair Powell gives starkest warning yet on potential economic consequences from tariffs Powell’s comments echo concerns that emerged in recent weeks as consumers and businesses grapple with Trump’s tariffs. Spending at US retailers surged in March at the strongest monthly pace in more than two years, according to Commerce Department data, as Americans rushed to beat Trump’s massive tariff hikes. Nvidia (NVDA) slumped 6.87% on Wednesday after the chipmaker said it would take a $5.5 billion hit because the US government placed new restrictions on the export of its artificial intelligence chips to China. The export restriction on Nvidia is another step in the growing contest between the US and China for dominance in AI. That battle has heated up since January, when upstart DeepSeek caught Silicon Valley by surprise with its lower cost, ChatGPT-like AI model that has spurred an AI boom in China. “While we expect that trade talks will ultimately yield progress, the brinkmanship between the US and China looks set to continue in the near term,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Wednesday. Stocks are coming off slight losses on Tuesday. Investors are on alert for updates from the White House that might signal developments in trade policy. The Trump administration on Monday kicked off investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductor chips (a precursor to potential tariffs), according to notices posted to the Federal Register. Trump said on Sunday he would be announcing a tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be flexibility with some companies in the sector. The S&P 500 on Monday had posted its first back-to-back gain in two weeks after the Trump administration announced exemptions on tariffs on electronics imported from China, in addition to Trump saying he is considering exemptions on tariffs on automakers. Despite the brief rally, the S&P 500 was down Tuesday and Wednesday and is still trading below its closing price on April 2, just before Trump initially laid out his “reciprocal” tariffs. “In the interim, if the recent flip-flopping around US tariffs and their implementation (as with last Friday’s reprieve for tariffs on tech) is anything to go by, the only certainty is that market participants will be forced to endure a period of extended market uncertainty,” analysts at Citi said in a Monday note. The prospects for the global economy have taken a knock because of Trump’s trade war, according to a new report by the World Trade Organization. The WTO said it expects global gross domestic product to expand by 2.2% this year. That growth would be 0.6 percentage points lower than the rate it would expect in a scenario with no additional tariffs. Meanwhile, gold surged more than 3% on Wednesday to a fresh record high above $3,300 a troy ounce. Gold is considered a safe haven amid economic and geopolitical turmoil. Analysts at Goldman Sachs on Friday raised their year-end price forecast for gold to $3,700, underscoring how demand for the yellow metal is expected to continue amid an escalating US-China trade war. Tariffs are clouding Wall Street’s outlook Investors this week are also digesting earnings results for the first quarter. Wall Street’s banking giants like Bank of America posted strong earnings, though chief executives on calls with analysts acknowledged that uncertainty looms. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase all posted record revenue from equities (activities related to the stock market) in the first quarter as the banks’ trading desks benefited from volatility in the market. Despite strong results, the chief executives at the major banks have warned of continued uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement Friday that the economy is “facing considerable turbulence.” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in a statement Monday that the climate is a “markedly different operating environment than earlier this year.” Related article
      The global trade war will badly hurt the US and global economies, WTO says “The prospect of a recession has increased with growing indications that economic activity is slowing down,” Solomon said on a call with analysts. “Our clients, including corporate CEOs and institutional investors, are concerned by the significant near-term and longer-term uncertainty that has constrained their ability to make important decisions.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement on Tuesday that “we potentially face a changing economy.” The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six major foreign currencies, slid 0.8% Wednesday and hit its lowest level in three years. The dollar index is coming off its biggest single-week decline since 2022. “All eyes are on Washington,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management Group. “The tariff decisions are what will impact sentiment and equity prices.” The yield on the 10-year Treasury note traded around 4.28%, down from Tuesday, as investors snapped up government bonds. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Wednesday, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. The index has been staunchly in “extreme fear” since the end of March. CNN’s Anna Cooban, Bryan Mena and Tami Luhby contributed reporting.",,0.27825963497161865
"Nvidia is caught in the middle of an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Nvidia on Tuesday said it will take a $5.5 billion financial hit after Washington placed fresh restrictions on the export of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, in the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance. Nvidia (NVDA) slumped 6.87% Wednesday after tumbling during premarket trading. The export restrictions on Nvidia come as President Donald Trump’s tariffs are roiling global markets and raising concerns about the prospects for global economic growth. The World Trade Organization on Wednesday said its expectations for global trade this year have “deteriorated sharply” owing to the battery of new tariffs on goods and uncertainty around future trade policy. The H20 chip, released just last year, was purposefully made to accommodate stringent US export controls to China and allowed Nvidia to continue selling to the country. The model has less computing power than the more powerful H100 AI chip, which has already been banned for sale to China. “Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to comply with US exports restrictions…now the rules change and they lost $5 billion,” said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “So this inconsistent trade policy is costing companies a lot of money.” The H20 is believed to have contributed to DeepSeek’s successful development of its ChatGPT-like reasoning AI model, R1, which was said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of American equivalents. The development stunned the tech industry and sparked an AI revolution in China. Nvidia said in a Tuesday regulatory filing that it was informed by the US government last week the H20 chips would now require a special license to be exported to China, which accounted for 13% of sales last year. The chipmaker said it will report approximately $5.5 billion worth of charges in its first quarter’s earnings on May 28, associated with H20 products for “inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.” Analysts led by Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said the financial impact is small relatively, but the restrictions mark a “strategic blow” for Nvidia’s efforts to continue engaging its Chinese customers. “This disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China as the Trump Administration knows there is one chip and company fueling the AI Revolution and it’s Nvidia,” they said in a Tuesday research note. New export rules The industry-leading AI chip designer has been caught in the crossfire in recent years as the US seeks to block China’s use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems. The US Commerce Department confirmed on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements on China-related exports of Nvidia’s H20 and another American AI chipmaker AMD’s MI308 chips, as well as their equivalents, according to Reuters. “The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President’s directive to safeguard our national and economic security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson was quoted as saying. Nvidia was told the license requirement would be in place indefinitely, the company said in the filing. It is unclear how the US government would grant the licenses. The company declined to comment beyond its filing. While the Trump administration’s imposition of curbs on the H20 chips was widely expected, the restriction was more abrupt than anticipated, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Wednesday note. Since DeepSeek’s R1 model shook global markets earlier this year, American lawmakers on both sides of the aisle jointly called for tighter export controls on AI chips. In the months since, China has seen an AI boom, with DeepSeek’s reveal galvanizing investment and pressure on Chinese companies to advance its AI sector. Investor confidence in the country’s tech sector has surged, driving rallies in China and Hong Kong stocks. DeepSeek, along with many of China’s established tech giants, have been major consumers of Nvidia’s H20 graphic processing units. While Chinese tech heavy weight Huawei and AI chipmaker Cambroon have developed alternatives to H20s, those China-made chips generally lag in performance, particularly in software maturity, according to Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, a market analysis firm. The performance gap between Chinese chips and Nvidia’s is expected to widen, Wang said, because of “Nvidia’s superior ecosystem and manufacturing advantages,” even as  DeepSeek’s rise demonstrates that high-performing AI models can be trained with lower-spec hardware. Tariffs will sharply reduce global and US economic growth, WTO forecasts The prospects for the global economy have taken a knock because of Trump’s trade war, according to a new report by the WTO. The WTO projects global economies will grow more slowly than they would without tariffs — especially in North America, a region dominated by the United States, which will see a greater slowdown than other areas. The WTO said it expects global gross domestic product to expand by 2.2% this year. That growth would be 0.6 percentage points lower than the rate it would expect in a scenario with no additional tariffs. In North America, the impact will be more severe still, with GDP growth expected to be 1.6 percentage points below what it would be otherwise. More trade restrictions coming With the escalation of an aggressive trade war between the US and China, Ives said further restrictions may be coming. “While the Nvidia news is concerning, it’s not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,” he said. In 2022, President Joe Biden began curbing the sale of advanced semiconductors from chipmakers like Nvidia to China over concerns that they could power its military. The controls have subsequently expanded to include restrictions on sales of chipmaking equipment, high-bandwidth memory chips and products manufactured outside the US using American technology in order to limit China’s technological progress. Related article
      Biden unveils last round of AI chip curbs aimed at China, Russia Before Biden stepped down, his administration also broadened the geographic scope of those restrictions, unveiling a global export framework that subjects countries to different restrictions in a bid to prevent advanced AI technology from getting into the hands of adversaries like China through third countries. The new rules are expected to take effect next month. The series of restrictions have come under repeated criticism from US tech giants, particularly Nvidia, which says they will undercut US competitiveness. Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, wrote in a company blog post that the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad. But the restrictions put that global progress “in jeopardy” and threatened to “derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” he said.",,0.3252503573894501
"China is taking the trade war to a new battleground: America’s TikTok feeds. Chinese suppliers have been flooding American social media this week, urging users to outflank President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs on Beijing by buying directly from their factories. One TikTok user, who goes by Wang Sen, claims that he is the original equipment manufacturer for most luxury brands, while standing in front of a wall of what appear to be ultra-spendy Birkin bags. OEMs work behind the scenes to make the products that another company then sells under its own brand. “Why don’t you just contact us and buy from us? You won’t believe the prices we (will) give you,” he said in one clip. His video was later taken down by the app. In the meantime, though, DHgate, an online wholesale store infamous for selling Chinese dupes of luxury goods, has shot to #2 on the US Apple app store. Another app, Taobao, China’s OG e-commerce site, is at #7. It’s highly improbable that these are real suppliers for brands like Lululemon and Chanel, multiple experts told CNN. Legitimate manufacturers usually sign non-disclosure agreements, so it’s unlikely that these creators are selling the real thing. But the videos are highlighting not only the anxiety that the tariffs are causing consumers, they also reveal how much shoppers rely on China. These Chinese creators are pushing the message that, despite the White House’s insistence that their economic policies put America first, those same policies will cause the American consumer to lose access to their favorite products or pay more for them. “Now this is how you do a trade war,” read one comment under a video claiming to feature the suppliers of Lululemon leggings with over 1.5 million likes. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. You’re not really buying direct from these brands In one video, an influencer who goes by the name LunaSourcingChina touts two factories they say are located in Yiwu, a city famous for its wholesale market, claiming that activewear brand Lululemon sources its $98 leggings directly from them. “I guess most of you know the price of Lululemon or other big brands … and guess what, here in these two factories, you can get them for around five to six bucks,” she said. Lulu, however, quickly refuted those claims. In a statement Monday, Lulu said it “does not work with the manufacturers identified in the online videos and we urge consumers to be aware of potentially counterfeit products and misinformation.” The two factories mentioned in the TikTok aren’t included in Lululemon’s April 2025 supplier list. The company does work with a number of factories in the Chinese mainland, but it also has suppliers in countries like Vietnam, Peru and Cambodia. However, any factory offering direct orders to American consumers is probably not legit, experts say. Any manufacturer producing for big name brands is likely under strict contractual obligations to not disclose that fact, Hao Dong, a senior lecturer in operations and project management at the University of Southampton, told CNN. They definitely wouldn’t be publicly selling those big-name products on the internet. The products in the TikTok videos could also be high-quality dupes and counterfeits, which Lululemon has previously tried to combat. The truth behind luxury So, are the expensive handbags watches labeled made in Italy or Switzerland actually produced in China? The answer is “neither a clear yes, nor a clear no,” Regina Frei, professor of sustainable and circular systems at University of the Arts London, told CNN. Many luxury brands will preassemble some items or hardware in China before assembling the final product in France and Italy. That could be things like the complicated hardware for an expensive watch or the packaging for a designer tote. But there’s no way to fully know because of the famously opaque luxury supply chains, Frei said. Even factories located in Italy or other countries can still have links to China, such as foreign ownership or management. “If you talk about very expensive handbags that involve a lot of manual work, they will probably be preassembled somewhere, and then they will be finalized, say, in France,” she said. So even if some of the parts of luxury goods do come from China, there’s no guarantee of proper safety and quality control measures if you buy the final product from these warehouses on TikTok. There also aren’t any warranties or returns. And it’s unclear how these products, even if bought directly from Chinese manufacturers,  could escape Trump’s 145% tariffs. Experts predict that even goods bought directly from manufacturers on sites like Temu and Aliexpress will face price increases with the upcoming elimination of the de minimis exemption for packages worth less than $800. Facing consumerism As these videos from Chinese manufacturers go viral, America’s dependence on Chinese and international supply chains ﻿are under a spotlight. That transparency is forcing some consumers to contend with a question long buried in the back of the American psyche: Where do my favorite products actually come from? “If China stopped producing, our shops would be empty,” Frei said. But the attention is also highlighting the environmental impact of ordering en masse from Chinese manufacturers – a practice that exploded in popularity with the rise of shops like Shein and Temu, which benefitted from the soon-to-be-defunct de minimis tax exemption. The individual shipping of packages around the world is an “environmental disaster,” Frei said. These packages are individually wrapped in plastic and sent by airplanes or cargo ships around the world, creating a massive carbon footprint, Frei said. And oftentimes, these cheap items end up as rubbish. “Are we witnessing the death of capitalism?” one user joked on TikTok.",,0.35431551933288574
"Hong Kong’s postal service will stop handling packages coming from or going to the United States, in the latest retaliatory move amid an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing. In a statement published Wednesday announcing the decision, the government of Hong Kong cited US President Donald Trump’s decision last week to eliminate the so-called de minimis exception for items posted from the city to the US. The exemption applied to international shipments worth $800 or less entering the US. “The US is unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively,” the government said in the statement. “The public in Hong Kong should be prepared to pay exorbitant and unreasonable fees due to the US’s unreasonable and bullying acts.” The government said the postal service, Hongkong Post, will stop accepting packages transported by sea with immediate effect and stop taking airborne packages starting from April 27. Other postal items containing only documents, for example letters, will not be affected. The retaliatory move means companies and individuals in Hong Kong will have to pay private couriers such as DHL, FedEx and UPS to deliver packages, further driving up costs for consumers on top of US levies. A DHL spokesman told CNN that it will continue to process shipments to the US, monitor the situation and work with customers to help them keep up with latest changes. FedEx said it’s “business as usual.” CNN has reached out to UPS for comment. Trump signed an executive order earlier this month raising tariffs on goods worth $800 or less sent from China, including Hong Kong, arguing it was being used by retailers to avoid import taxes and customs inspections. Related article
      China posts unexpectedly strong economic growth before tariffs bite Initially, the exemption was set to expire and those goods were set to face tariffs of 30% on May 2. But Trump’s latest executive order last week hiked the rates to 120% (or a “per postal item” cost of $100 starting May 2, which goes up to $200 on June 1). Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese city, has long been known as a free and open international trading port, which charges minimal import levies and no sales tax. It previously had a special trading status with the US, which allowed goods from the city to be subject to lower tariffs and a customs process separate to that for goods from mainland China. Trump revoked the special trade status in 2020 during his first administration, voicing concerns over the city’s deteriorating freedom and autonomy as Beijing cracked down on protests and imposed a sweeping national security law on the financial hub. As tensions flare between Washington and Beijing, Hong Kong is increasingly caught in the crossfire. Exports from Hong Kong are now subject to the same 145% tariff the Trump administration has slapped on imports from China, even though the city has decided not to follow Beijing’s lead in retaliating with a 125% levy on American imports. Hong Kong’s leader John Lee, who was selected for the job by a largely government-appointed, pro-Beijing committee, joined Chinese officials on Tuesday to hit back at Washington with a stern rebuttal.

"President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted what he calls the return of manufacturing to the United States, hailing companies that have vowed to pour large amounts of money into making everything from computer chips to cars in America. But announcements are easy to make. In the long term, why would companies and other countries decide to invest in the US, which has upended the global economic order in just weeks? The United States moved from a stable economy, a trusted partner in trade agreements and global security, to a source of confusion and doubt in mere weeks after Trump assumed office on January 20. Perhaps no one has put it more bluntly than Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, on Wednesday, when she said to a news outlet in Germany: “The West as we knew it no longer exists.” In other words: The United States isn’t the only trade game in town. Sure, the US is the world’s biggest economy, with a gross domestic product of almost $30 trillion. But China, the world’s No. 2 economy, is at about $18 trillion, according to the World Bank. And the total value of the European Union’s economy is around 17 trillion euros, or about $19 trillion. “We have 166 members in the organization. US trade is 13% of world trade. That means that there’s 87% of world trade happening between the other members of the WTO,” Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CNN’s Richard Quest on Wednesday. Trump has repeatedly claimed that other countries have been “ripping off” the United States for years, despite American growth rates that have been the envy of the developed world. So far, he has imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel; 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada that aren’t compliant with a free-trade agreement; a massive 145% duty on Chinese imports; a 25% tariff on cars, with separate tariffs on auto parts coming at a later date; and a 10% baseline tariffs on all US imports. But those numbers don’t quite capture the whiplash-inducing speed with which Trump has levied tariffs, then walked them back, only to announce more tariffs, with another policy change soon after. The constantly changing playing field has made it even more difficult for businesses and nations to contend with the new policies. The tariffs in place now “will likely slow global economic growth significantly,” Moody’s Ratings said in a recent report. “And the inconsistent approach to policymaking has undermined confidence globally.” The changes have been not only swift but also deep. “These are very fundamental policy changes,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday. “There isn’t a modern experience of how to think about this.” His comments sent US stock markets slumping, with investors clearly uneasy about what it means when a usually staid central banker suggests the world economic order is being turned topsy-turvy. (Trump ripped Powell on social media the next day, ostensibly for not lowering interest rates quickly enough, writing: “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!”) Related article
      Cheap things from China are poised to get pricey. Secondhand retailers are ready to take advantage Already, as CNN’s Allison Morrow points out, companies and individuals are seeing real-world effects, from chipmaker Nvidia to aircraft maker (and top US exporter) Boeing, all the way to people shopping for cheap clothing or makeup hauls on Temu and Shein. China, for its part, has been diversifying its trading relationships beyond the US since its trade war with the US during Trump’s first administration. China’s exports to the US dropped from 19.2% of its total overseas shipments in 2018, to 14.7% in 2024, said Sheng Laiyun, deputy director of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, at a news conference Wednesday. Reuters reported last week that Beijing is trying to strengthen trading with the EU, despite the occasional past spat over cheap goods and trade flows. When asked by a reporter on Thursday if he was worried about China cozying up to US allies, Trump denied the possibility. “No, no,” he said. “Nobody can compete with us, nobody.” But China isn’t alone in distancing itself from the US. Many Canadians have already canceled trips to the US to boycott Trump’s tariff policy. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney last week posted on social media about speaking with von der Leyen. “Throughout our history, Canada and Europe have worked together to build up our economies and bolster our shared security,” he wrote. “In this time of global uncertainty, we’re focused on making our relationship even stronger.” Von der Leyen echoed those comments Wednesday, noting that more governments, including Canada, Mexico and India, have said they want to work more with the EU. “Everyone is asking for more trade with Europe — and it’s not just about economic ties,” she said. “It is also about establishing common rules and it is about predictability. Europe is known for its predictability and reliability, which is once again starting to be seen as something very valuable.” Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, pressed for European unity ahead of Trump’s April 2 announcement on so-called “reciprocal” tariffs. “I consider it a moment when we can decide together to take our destiny into our own hands, and I think it is a march to independence,” she told France Inter radio.

"The United States has unveiled plans to impose new port fees on Chinese ships, saying it aims to revive American shipbuilding against China’s dominance in the industry. President Donald Trump has embarked on a sweeping trade war with China, a move his administration portrays as a bid to bring manufacturing back to the United States but that critics and many economists fear could trigger a global recession and increased prices for consumers. The Federal Register notice posted by the US Trade Representative (USTR) on Thursday said the US government will charge fees on all Chinese-built and -owned ships docking in US ports based on net tonnage or goods carried on each voyage. The new fees will be enforced in around 180 days’ time, rolled out in a phased manner, and may be raised in coming years, according to the USTR notice. The latest announcement backtracks from proposals floated in February to charge China-built ships of up to $1.5 million per port call, which had prompted a widespread industry backlash, Reuters reported. “Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce,” US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement. “The Trump administration’s actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain, and send a demand signal for US-built ships.” The US plan provoked a robust response from Beijing. “China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to this,” China’s commerce ministry said in a statement Friday. “China will closely follow the relevant developments of the US and will resolutely take necessary measures to safeguard its own rights and interests.” And at a regular press conference, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian said that imposing port fees and adding tariffs on loading and unloading equipment were “measures that harm others and the US itself.” “It not only raises global shipping costs and disrupts the stability of the global industry but also increases inflation pressures in the US, harming the interests of American consumers and businesses,” Lin said, adding that the measures would “eventually fail to revitalize the US shipbuilding industry.” From October 14, Chinese-owned and operated ships will be charged $50 a net ton, a rate that will increase by $30 a year over the next three years. Chinese-built ships owned by non-Chinese firms will be charged $18 a net ton, with annual fee increases of $5 over the same period. The new levies on Chinese cargo vessels add to escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Trump has already hiked tariffs to a combined 145% on Chinese-made goods while Beijing has retaliated with 125% duties on US goods. Speaking to reporters about tariffs at the White House earlier Thursday, Trump signaled a potential halt of the tit-for-tat tariff hikes, which China has described as a “meaningless” numbers game. “I don’t want them to go higher because at a certain point you make it where people don’t buy,” he said. Beijing said last Friday it does not intend to lift tariffs on US goods higher than the rate it has announced. Trump also told reporters on Thursday that he wants to negotiate trade deals with every country, including China. He noted that his administration is speaking with Chinese officials in an effort to work out a deal. The day prior, a person familiar with the Chinese government’s thinking said China is open to trade negotiations with the United States but that any talks should be based on “respect” and greater “consistency and reciprocity” from the Trump administration.

"In Flushing, Queens, fresh produce, soy sauces and seaweed-flavored snacks line the aisles at Chang Jiang Supermarket. Chang Jiang sits amid a row of stores in this majority-Asian community, where colorful storefronts feature signs in Chinese and fresh fruit is sold in boxes on the sidewalk. Local grocers are often the lifelines of the communities they serve. Indian grocers offer cake rusk biscuits to accompany chai tea, and Chinese grocers reliably keep red jars of Lao Gan Ma chili oil and dried plums in stock. Related article
      Here’s which grocery store items will get more expensive because of tariffs But Chang Jiang Supermarket — like other Asian American grocery stores — is caught in President Donald Trump’s trade war. Most imported goods face a 10% tariff even after the Trump administration suspended reciprocal tariffs against a laundry list of countries. But his biggest target, by far, is China. Last month, it began with Trump raising US tariffs on Chinese goods by 20% before tit-for-tat escalation rose levies to a whopping 145%. With no negotiations in sight for the two nations, that’s putting community ties under growing strain — especially for Chinese grocers like Chang Jiang. “With the way things are now, if the tariff doesn’t come down, after two months, there won’t be any more inventory (from China) in the market,” said Wu, the Queens supermarket’s manager, who spoke to CNN on the condition that only his last name is used. Across the US, shoppers can expect to see prices rise on seafood, coffee, fruit, cheese, nuts, candy bars and other imported foods due to Trump’s across-the-board 10% tariffs. The anticipated price hikes will hit low-income shoppers the hardest, because they spend a greater share of their incomes on essentials like groceries. And for those who depend on produce and other items from China, the astronomical tariffs on Chinese goods will have an even greater impact. “Companies in China still depend on us consumers. However much they increase, it all impacts us consumers,” he said. ‘Unimaginable’ consequences loom ahead During a phone interview in Mandarin, Wu said the suppliers he buys from are raising prices on all products. While manufacturers have not increased prices for the goods they currently have on hand, new inventory could see significant hikes of 30%, 40% or even 50%. It’s often not even the cost of items that’s an issue right now, Wu said. Some manufacturers have stopped shipping goods to the US entirely due to the tariffs, he said, leading to limits on sales and possible shortages in the short term. “The price hasn’t increased very much (for what suppliers currently have on hand),” he said. But instead of selling him the 50 or 100 items he needs, “they’ll say, ‘I’ll just give you five or 10 items, and that’s it.’” The supermarket hasn’t raised prices for its customers just yet. But in two months, when his inventory from China will run out, Wu says he’ll be forced to turn to suppliers in other countries — perhaps Taiwan or somewhere in Southeast Asia — to make up for the loss. “We hope that (the trade war between the US and China) is solved as soon as possible,” he said. “If it keeps on getting delayed for two months, the consequences will be unimaginable.” But it’s not just this New York community — a similar pain is felt across the coast at Wing Hop Fung in Arcadia, California. The family business imports teas, Chinese herbs and other Asian products in this majority-Asian community near Los Angeles. “Our biggest trading partner is China, so when we hear that these tariffs are going up, we definitely feel it’s a threat to small minority family businesses like ours,” Lan Ong, whose parents started Wing Hop Fung in 1985 and who now runs the business, told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS earlier this month. She said containers were arriving from China with six-figures worth of products, and she isn’t sure how the business will absorb tariffs that will more than double the costs. Ong has been trying to work with her suppliers and vendors, she added, but “as soon as that import, that container, arrives to our warehouse, that tariff has to be paid right away.” A staple for immigrant communities — and beyond The demand for specialty and ethnic grocery ingredients has only been rising over the past decade, Phil Lempert, editor of trade publication Supermarket Guru, told CNN. The market for these specialty ingredients is expected to reach $153.2 billion worldwide in 2032, up from 2023’s $81.6 billion market, according to estimates from Fortune Business Insights. That’s largely because of broadening American tastes for Asian, Hispanic and Middle Eastern dishes, among others. “The internet has exposed us to foods from all over the world,” Lempert said. “You have a whole bunch of people going to the stores to be able to find foods they can’t find in their traditional supermarket.” That interest had led to a transformation of the supermarket industry in the United States. H Mart, a Korean grocery store with a dedicated online fanbase, has grown to nearly 100 locations across the nation since its founding in Woodside, Queens, in 1982. Patel Bros, founded in Chicago in the 1970s, says it is now the largest Indian grocery chain in the United States. Asian supermarket chain 99 Ranch also has locations in multiple states from California to New Jersey. The H Marts of the world have the resources to prepare and fortify their supply chain, Lempert said. But for small, locally owned grocery stores, there isn’t much they can do. In Honolulu, the uncertainty of Trump’s tariffs has rattled small businesses in Chinatown. Chu Lan Shubert-Kwock, who founded the local Chinatown Business & Community Association, said that the trade war “will set us back.” “(Businesses are) not going to stock up until they sell their stuff,” she told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB last week. “You are not going to buy until you’re sure how much your goods are going to be, and how much you can sell them for.” She added: “Nobody wins in this trade war.” In time, shoppers at these stores might see less product in the store. They’ll also see higher prices, Lempert said. At Chang Jiang, Wu had a warning for customers who are worried about their favorite products going away or getting more expensive. “I’m calling for everyone to stock up during this short period of time when goods are still at their current prices,” he said, “because prices will definitely skyrocket later.”",,0.3300369083881378
"With every race, 17-year-old Australian sprinter Gout Gout seems to reach yet another milestone and further underscore his immense potential. On Sunday, he won the men’s 200 meters title at the Australian Athletics Championships in Perth in 19.84 seconds, an extraordinary time that would have propelled him into the record books but for an illegal wind reading of 2.2m per second. The wind-aided time was the second fastest 200m ever recorded by an under-20 sprinter in all conditions – faster than Olympic gold medalists Usain Bolt, Justin Gatlin and Leslie Tebogo clocked at the same age category. It would have been a new championship record too, surpassing Gout’s own mark he set in the heats by 0.37 seconds, but for times to stand in the official history books they must have been recorded with less than a 2m/s tailwind. His latest accolade came after he broke the 10-second barrier for the 100 meters twice in the same day on his way to winning the men’s under-20 100m title at the national championships on Thursday, albeit also assisted by illegally high tailwinds. “Feels pretty good,” Gout said after winning the senior 200m title on Sunday, per Reuters. “That’s what I’ve been chasing, I’ve been chasing getting that sub 10, focusing on my first hundred and that’s exactly what I did. “I got out, I sent it. Top speed is my gift. I used it, took off and I got sub 20 so I couldn’t be happier. “I think (I’m) maybe one of the youngest to ever win a men’s national title, so it definitely feels great. Couldn’t be happier for sure.” At times during the 200m on Saturday, it seemed as if Gout’s springy, languid strides were twice as long as those of his rivals as he powered away from the rest of the field around the bend and crossed the line meters ahead of anyone else. His archrival Lachlan Kennedy, who had looked best placed to challenge him, was disqualified for a false start.",,0.29140159487724304
"Long lines have been forming at gas stations in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, amid fuel shortages and a price spike in recent months. But electric vehicle driver Mikial Belayneh avoids them completely. “I no longer line up for petrol on the road,” Belayneh, an Addis resident, told CNN. A full charge of his imported Toyota bZ4X – a popular EV in the country – “is more than enough for two days.” Belayneh, who charges his car at home, is part of rapid transition to EVs in Addis Ababa, a fast-growing city in the horn of Africa at the center of Ethiopia’s goal to hoist millions of people out of poverty. In addition to the polluting cars and trucks rumbling along the roads, cleaner — and quieter — vehicles are joining the traffic. Electric buses, smaller 15-seat minibuses, cars and motorbikes are popping up on the streets of the capital. There are around 100,000 EVs in Ethiopia so far. The Ethiopian government estimates that number will more than quadruple by 2032. That’s largely because the national government took the extraordinary step earlier this year of banning the import of all gas-powered passenger vehicles — becoming the first nation in the world to do so. It also effectively slashed the customs tax on imported cars: The tax on gas vehicles was up to 200% before they were banned, while the import tax for fully assembled EVs is just 15%, according to the country’s finance ministry. It’s part of a government-led effort to get more EVs on the streets. The lower rates are also spurring more local EV manufacturing. Hundreds of the vehicles were assembled by Ethiopia-based Belayneh Kindie Group using parts imported from China. Besufekad Shewaye, manager at the company, told CNN that import tariffs are “almost zero percent” for EV parts that are assembled in Ethiopia. “Nowadays most vehicle owners prefer EVs, especially light vehicles,” Shewaye said. “The demand is increasing from day to day.” A rapid shift from gasoline Ethiopia is leaning hard into EVs in part because importing fuel is expensive, and 96% of the country’s electricity comes from clean hydropower – a dual win for the country’s finances and the environment. “They really are a clean-energy country,” said Jane Akumu, a Kenya-based program officer at the United Nations Environment Programme. “Why are you importing oil while you have local electricity that you can actually use for your vehicles?” The government recognized it had a bountiful renewable energy source in the country when it started shifting towards EVs, said Assefa Hadis Hagos, a transportation adviser for the Ethiopian Ministry of Transport and Logistics. Yet the total ban on gas-powered car imports, passed in January, took many in the region by surprise. “We didn’t know that the government was going to fully back a total ban,” Akumu said. Ethiopia, which has for years been ruled by a one-party authoritarian government, has shown it can quickly implement environmental policies that would likely take longer in more democratic nations. In the early 2000s, the nation moved rapidly to ban inefficient and dangerous leaded gasoline. “Other countries require more consultative process, more participation,” said Akumu, who also spearheaded the effort to eradicate leaded gasoline in Africa. The number of cars on the road in Ethiopia is still quite low, about 1.2 million in total — or roughly one car for every 100 people. In the US, more than 91% of Americans own at least one car. In Africa’s most populous of country Nigeria, it’s 11.8 million cars total, or between 5 and 6 cars per 100 people. The Ethiopian government had kept car ownership rates low with its dramatically high taxes on gas-powered vehicles that cost consumers up to three times the value of car imports — part of an effort to get more people to use public transportation. Related article
      Americans have saved billions with a law they know next to nothing about Even though the government has reduced or eliminated some of the taxes for imported EVs, buying an electric car is still expensive. “In terms of who is buying EVs, it’s definitely those in the high-income groups,” said Iman Abubaker, who is based in Ethiopia and works on sustainable transportation for the World Resources Institute, a global nonprofit organization. For this reason, Abubaker’s group and others are working to push the Ethiopian government and others around the continent to invest more in electric buses and public transport, so the efficient vehicles can be used by people of all income levels. Despite the cost, Ethiopia’s vehicle fleet has seen a gradual but sustained rise in the number of EVs displacing combustion engine cars. Within two years of the country’s 10-year goal to bring in more than 100,000 EVs — started in 2022 — EVs already account for nearly 10% of its vehicles, according to CleanTechnica. Ethiopia’s government “feels good” about the pace of the transition, Hagos, the transportation advisor, told CNN. He added the government has a “commitment” to reducing climate and environmental pollution from gas cars. EV buses and boda bodas For now, Ethiopia stands alone in its ban of imported gas cars. The country’s ban is “definitely a one-off,” said Moses Nderitu, the Kenya managing director of electric bus company BasiGo. But EV growth around the continent is happening even without such bans. In Nairobi, Kenya, electric motorbikes are seeing startling growth. Last year, Uber rolled out a fleet of eye-catching yellow motorbikes – known locally as boda bodas. After the Kenyan government passed tax incentives, there was a 500% jump in electric motorbikes on the road in a single year, industry experts told CNN, going from the low hundreds to about 3,000 bikes on the streets of Nairobi. That number is still a small fraction of the 200,000 total bikes on Nairobi’s streets, but it has already helped cut down on noise pollution in parts of the city, said Hezbon Mose, the Kenya country director for e-bike company Ampersand, which has fleets of bikes in both Kenya and Rwanda. In the Ethiopian capital, stricter measures, which include the non-issuance of licenses for fuel-run motorbikes, have been implemented by the city’s authorities who approved a timeline in April for gasoline motorcycles to be converted to electric-powered models. Earlier in March, the city introduced its first fleet of electric buses for public transit. American-style electric public buses — more drab than the colorful and music playing gas-powered matatu buses in Kenya — are also starting to be driven more on Nairobi streets. Both Mose and Nderitu see EVs on the rise across the continent, as some countries look to get off oil in favor of cheaper electricity. Much more infrastructure and government subsidies are needed in many countries to get more people to go electric. “I look at electric vehicles exactly as we looked at the mobile telephone market 30 years ago,” Nderitu told CNN. “When the rest of the world started adopting mobile phones, there was no infrastructure (in Africa). There was a very small amount of people who were connected to phones. Today you look at Nairobi, you hardly find anybody without a phone.” Correction: A previous version of this story had some bad math in it with respect to the number of cars in Ethiopia. It’s roughly one car for every 100 people. This story has been updated.",,0.22433073818683624
"“La tasweer! La tasweer!” (“Don’t film! Don’t film!”) the general shouted, his eyes flashing with anger, his jaw clenched as he stormed towards us. A couple of fighters hopped off the back of the militia’s lead truck, fanning out around our vehicle, their rifles drawn. The second truck that had been following us, tan-colored and laden with a heavy machine gun abruptly pulled over to our side, hemming us in. There was a moment of panic — were they going to shoot us? We had come to Darfur to report on the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, never intending to become part of the story. But months of planning came apart in moments when we were detained by a militia led by the man everyone called the general. Cameraman Scott McWhinnie handed him the camera, assuring him, “We’re not filming, we’re not filming.” Producer Brent Swails quickly got out of our truck to try to defuse the situation. “Are we OK? Are we OK?” he asked. Abruptly, the general turned his back on us and grabbed a rifle from one of his soldiers, before taking aim across the tree-dotted savanna. I was relieved that the gun wasn’t pointed at us but still disturbed by his erratic behavior. I looked pleadingly at our driver. “What’s going on?” His face was ashen. “I don’t know,” he said. The general fired off a round. The target appeared to be a bird. He missed. We had arrived in North Darfur the previous day. The goal was to get to Tawila, a town under the control of SLM-AW, a faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement, led by Abdul Wahid al-Nur, a neutral party in Sudan’s bitter civil war. Tawila is just 32 miles (51 kilometers) southwest of the besieged city of El Fasher which is the frontline of the grisly fight for the Darfur region. As a result, it has become a refuge of sorts for the tens of thousands fleeing the city. The 18-month conflict in Sudan has been drastically overshadowed by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza but the UN fears it could become far deadlier: a cruel confluence of hunger, displacement, and disease with both the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the two main warring parties in this conflict, accused of war crimes. According to the UN, more than 10 million people have been displaced in the violence, almost a quarter of Sudan’s population. More than 26 million people — over three times the population of New York City — face acute hunger. In particular, all eyes are on Darfur, where a genocide was perpetrated from 2003 to 2005 and where vicious war crimes have heightened fears that the worst could be realized again. In August, a famine was declared in the Zamzam displaced people’s camp in Darfur. And yet, only a handful of international journalists have been able to get in since the start of the war to report on what is happening. After many months of failing to get permission to visit Darfur from the SAF or the RSF, the invitation from the SLM-AW leadership to visit Tawila seemed the safest way to get in and tell the story. But when we reached the agreed meeting spot in the town of Abu Gamra, our hosts were nowhere to be found. Instead, a rival militia stood in their place. They had two Toyota Land Cruiser pickup trucks, weighed down with rocket propelled grenades and heavy machine guns. Our driver was led off in chains to the town jail. For three hours we were interrogated, one by one, in a small, windowless room. About eight men asked the questions. “Why are you here?” “Who sent you here?” “Who gave you permission to be here?” We answered their questions but got no information in return: who these men were or what they wanted with us. When the driver returned later without the chains, there was a brief moment of optimism. Perhaps, we would be escorted to the border and simply instructed not to return. But the militants bundled us into our vehicle and ordered us to follow them. Our convoy quickly veered off onto a dirt track, heading deeper into Darfur. It was at this point that the general suddenly stopped his vehicle and started shouting at us, before shooting his gun. The goal, presumably, to scare us. It worked. We stopped again, maybe an hour later, by a dry riverbed lined with trees. The youngest fighters laid out a mat and brought out a flask of camel milk for the general and another older man known as the security chief, who wore a turban and sunglasses to hide a missing eye. Trembling, I took off my shoes and sat down in front of them. “Please, we are very frightened,” I told them in halting Arabic. “I am a mother. I have three little boys.” The general looked disinterested, but I could see the security chief’s face soften. “Don’t be frightened, don’t be frightened,” he assured me, “We are human beings.” The security chief asked us for our partners’ phone numbers, so that he could call them and assure them that we were OK. Grudgingly, I handed him my husband’s number — reluctant to put my family through any stress but conscious that it might also be a way for our captors to check my story. Later, we would find out that an English speaker had called my husband and Scott’s wife from the city of Port Sudan, thousands of miles away from where we were held, to say that we were safe and in good health but threatening that we would be imprisoned for many years if they spoke about it to anyone. For the next 48 hours, we were held under armed guard by the general, the security chief and roughly a dozen soldiers, some who looked no older than 14. Our detention was spent out in the open, underneath acacia trees. As the only woman, and with no private space to relieve myself, I limited my water and food intake. Sleep, when it came, was a mercy, a reprieve from the clawing sense of panic at not knowing when I would be able to see my children again. As a journalist, one never wants to become the story. And yet our experience is instructive in understanding the complexities of the conflict in Darfur and the challenges of getting food and aid to those who need it most and getting the story out to the world. During our journey in and out of North Darfur, we spent many hours traversing the remote region on sandy tracks. We had to dig ourselves out more than 10 times and had a flat tire at least once a day. There are no paved roads in the area, which makes the distribution of aid even more challenging. But where sturdy trucks with the appropriate tires may help expedite that process, the issue of gaining access to the territory is a much harder problem to solve. The state of North Darfur is the center of some of the heaviest fighting between the RSF and SAF. Swaths of it are under the control of a patchwork of different militias with competing agendas who regularly shift allegiances.  You can have a guarantee of safe passage from one, only to be blocked by another 10 miles down the road. In August, at US-led talks on Sudan in Geneva, the Sudanese Armed Forces agreed to allow the flow of aid through Adre, the largest border point between Chad and Darfur. But fewer than 200 trucks have entered in the last two months — a fraction of what is needed on the ground — and only a handful of those have reached the famine-hit Zamzam camp outside El Fasher, where close to half a million people are struggling to survive. Earlier this month, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) announced it was having to suspend its operations in Zamzam. photo essay
      Millions have escaped Sudan’s civil war. But their nightmare isn’t over “This is a disaster for us. Knowing that we have the team on the ground capable to work and that this suspension is due to either administrative impediments or blockages by the warring parties is, of course, frustrating. We keep trying to push … We cannot abandon these people,” Michel Lacharité, MSF’s Head of Emergency Operations told me. Compounding the chaos is the difficulty of communications. During our time in North Darfur, we passed at least six cell phone towers but none of them were operational. The pecking order of any group is clearly marked by who is carrying the satellite phone. Our captors confiscated our satellite phone but allowed us to keep our cell phones — confident that they would never work. And they did not. Some of the groups have Starlink satellites that they use to stay in touch. But for most ordinary people, there are few ways to have contact with the outside world. The net result of these manifold challenges is that NGOs, human rights organizations and journalists have almost no access to North Darfur. “The world doesn’t see us, the help doesn’t come,” the security chief mused to me one afternoon. Instead, the most valuable and reliable data we have about the situation on the ground in Darfur comes from satellites. According to the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, which uses satellite imagery to build up a picture of the situation on the ground, in the first two weeks of October at least 14 villages in Darfur were set ablaze by the RSF, heightening concerns that after a relative lull during the rainy season, the conflict is once again ratcheting up. But satellite images can only tell part of the story. They don’t allow us to connect, to empathize, to engage. On our last day in detention, the general and security chief disappeared for about six hours, leaving us in the custody of their young fighters. At one point, several of them told us to remove our bags from our vehicle, saying they were taking our driver to the local market. The four of us looked at each other uneasily. Were they planning to abandon us? Or hand us over to another group? We had no choice but to do what we were told and unload our gear. Later, when the general and the security chief returned, they were in good spirits. “It has been decided you will be released tomorrow,” they told us. “We thought you were spies but now you can go home.” A wave of relief crashed through my body. There were smiles and handshakes with our captors. We posed awkwardly for a photograph at the edge of the mat that had been our makeshift prison. Our ordeal was over. We were unharmed and soon to return home. The fear and worry quickly replaced by a feeling of bitter disappointment, of failure. We never made it to Tawila. Never managed to talk to the people in Darfur whose lives have been chewed up by this vicious civil war. Untold stories that the world may never hear.

"This week, the United States accused the RSF militia in Sudan’s brutal civil conflict of committing genocide. It’s the second time in two decades that genocide has been declared in the northeast African nation, where thousands have died and millions are in the grip of a humanitarian crisis. How did the country get here? For 20 months, two of Sudan’s most powerful generals – Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – have viciously competed for territory in a country still reeling from the massacre of tens of thousands of people in the early 2000s and the displacement of millions more. The two men – former allies – jointly ousted President Omar al-Bashir from office in 2019. Together, they also contributed to another coup in 2021 when al-Burhan seized power from the country’s transitional government. Today, Sudan is riven by conflict, with the RSF believed to be in control of much of the country’s western and central regions, including Darfur and parts of the capital Khartoum. More than 11 million people have been internally displaced since the fighting erupted in April 2023, according to the United Nations, while millions more have fled Sudan. Hunger is widespread and famine conditions are now present in several areas of the country, the UN has warned. Who has been cited as responsible? US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Hemedti’s RSF and its allied Arab militias had perpetrated “direct attacks against civilians” including the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.” They also “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” Blinken said, adding that the same forces “targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.” “Based on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan,” he announced. The RSF described the decision by the US as “unjust,” adding in a statement on its Telegram channel that “the State Department’s claim that the RSF committed genocide in Sudan is inaccurate.” Related article
      At least 127, mostly civilians, killed in two days in Sudan bombardments “The decision fails to specify the group against which the alleged genocide was committed or the location of the genocide … The decision vaguely refers to the Sudanese people, of whom RSF fighters and supporters are an integral part,” the RSF statement said. The RSF has a history connected to ethnic-driven violence. The paramilitary group grew out of the Arab Janjaweed militia that oversaw the genocide of the early 2000s. That carnage left an estimated 300,000 people dead. Since fighting erupted in mid-April 2023 between the RSF and the SAF,  ethnically motivated killings have intensified, particularly in the western Darfur region. This mirrors the pattern of targeted killings that typified the first genocide. West Darfur witnessed some of its worst ethnic-related killings in 2023, when hundreds of people from non-Arab ethnic groups were massacred by the RSF and forces linked to it. On Tuesday, the US imposed sanctions on their leader Hemedti, “for his role in systematic atrocities committed against the Sudanese people,” and sanctioned seven RSF-linked companies and one individual “for their roles in procuring weapons for the RSF.” Are both warring factions complicit in abuses? In September last year, a United Nations fact-finding mission accused both the SAF and the RSF of complicity in war crimes. And in his statement, Blinken laid blame for abuses at the door of both parties. “The United States does not support either side of this war, and these actions against Hemedti and the RSF do not signify support or favor for the SAF,” he said. “Both belligerents bear responsibility for the violence and suffering in Sudan and lack the legitimacy to govern a future peaceful Sudan.” Sudanese activist, Hala Al-Karib, who heads the regional arm of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, told CNN that her organization had documented cases of sexual violence and sexual exploitation allegedly committed by fighters from both the SAF and the RSF. In Darfur, she said, where she has worked for over 20 years, sexual violence has been “used as a tool of terror to force communities to submit to the RSF,” – a pattern seen in previous conflicts that has been replicated by the militia group, she claimed. “It’s the same method and strategy,” she said of the alleged sexual crimes. “It’s also used for retaliation in their war against SAF and it has ethnic elements to it.” Al-Karib said that between October and January, her organization had handled cases of at least 10 girls, some as young as 14, who took their own lives after being gang-raped by RSF militia men in Sudan’s Al Jazira state. This had followed the defection of an RSF commander in the area to SAF, she said. “The RSF has been completely emboldened by impunity, a lack of accountability, and the fact that they were not seriously subjected to any sort of accountability,” she said, welcoming the US sanctions against Hemedti. Civilians and aid agencies have also borne the brunt of frequent shelling and staged raids by the Sudanese army and the RSF – targeting civilian areas and causing multiple casualties. Last month, more than 100 people were killed after bombs fell on a crowded market in North Darfur. In the same month, three staff members of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed in an airstrike on the agency’s office in Blue Nile State, wrapping up “the deadliest year on record for aid workers in Sudan,” the UN said. Dozens of airstrikes with multiple fatalities are reported daily by Sudanese media. A senior procurement official who led the SAF’s acquisition of arms was sanctioned by the US last October. The RSF and the Sudanese military typically blame one each other for such attacks, with a recent statement from the RSF criticizing the US for overlooking “widespread atrocities committed by the SAF, including aerial bombardments that have claimed the lives of more than 4,000 civilians.” CNN has reached out the Sudanese government on the matter but has not yet received a response. What is the impact on civilians? Before the deadly power tussle erupted between the SAF and the RSF, Sudan already ranked among the world’s poorest countries with decades of conflict hindering its economic growth. Their war, now in its second year, has displaced more than 11 million people within Sudan, while some 3.2 million others have fled to neighboring countries, according to UN figures. Some of those unable to flee are harbored in Darfur’s Zanzam camp, where famine was declared last month. The camp, home to around half a million displaced people, has also come under RSF bombardment. Hunger in Darfur has sometimes forced people to eat “grass and peanut shells” to survive, the then WFP regional director for Eastern Africa, Michael Dunford, said last year, amid warnings by the UN that some 26 million Sudanese were facing acute hunger. Food deliveries to Darfur resumed last August after a key border crossing was reopened by authorities for aid to enter Sudan. But in parts of Darfur, aid organizations are still impeded by restrictions and famine conditions area spreading to additional areas, a UN report said this week. On Friday, humanitarian group Médecins Sans Frontières, or, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was suspending activities at one of the last operating hospitals in the RSF-controlled south Khartoum, citing recurring attacks from armed fighters. “The medical needs are overwhelming. Injuries are often horrific. Mass casualty incidents have become almost routine,” MSF’s Emergency Coordinator, Claire San Filippo said in a statement. How has the world responded to the war? The Sudanese conflict has been largely overshadowed by hostilities in other parts of the world such as in Ukraine and Gaza, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said last year. However, warring factions in the African nation have also defied global efforts to end the conflict. Last month, Blinken told the UN Security Council that foreign actors were fueling the war in Sudan, but he did not name who they were. “To the foreign sponsors sending drones, missiles, mercenaries – enough. To those profiting off the illicit oil and gold trade that fund this conflict – enough,” he said. Sudan’s military government has frequently accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the RSF, but the Gulf nation denies this. The seven RSF-linked companies that were sanctioned by the US on Tuesday are all based in the UAE. In a statement to CNN, the UAE Foreign Ministry said: “The UAE has made absolutely clear that it is not providing any support or supplies to any of the two belligerent warring parties in Sudan. Our primary focus remains on addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Sudan. We continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to this man-made conflict.” A CNN investigation in 2023 found evidence that Russian mercenary group Wagner had been arming the RSF. The militia and the then Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied this at the time. In November, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called on Sudan’s warring factions to end the fighting, strengthen protections for civilians and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid. Sudan’s military-backed foreign ministry welcomed Russia’s action, saying the UN resolution undermined Sudan’s sovereignty. Will the US genocide determination make a difference? Sudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali told CNN that the US’ determination of genocide in Sudan was “long overdue” and should have happened sooner. Nonetheless, it is “a form of justice because it recognizes victims’ grievances,” he said. “It is a step towards peace and accountability by paving the way to hold actors responsible to account, not only perpetrators themselves but actors complicit in genocide,” added Ali, a legal adviser at the Canada-based Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. For activist Al-Karib, US sanctions against Hemedti and the declaration of genocide could be crucial in not only reining in his militia but also curbing the support he receives from foreign actors. “We don’t think that the scale of these atrocities happening in Sudan and Darfur would have been this big without the support of the UAE to the RSF,” she said. “So, we hope that the US decision to sanction Hemedti will send a strong message to the UAE to rethink its position and engage in a serious political process to end these atrocities and genocidal acts happening across the country.”",,0.2829168438911438
"While Russian ally Bashar al-Assad was being toppled by rebels in Syria, another friend of Moscow, President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, was being chaperoned by Kremlin-backed mercenaries in the conflict-ridden Central African Republic (CAR), where armed groups are yearning to oust him. “Without the protection of Wagner (a private Russian military force), he (Touadéra) could not be president at this time,” Aboubakar Siddick, spokesperson for an alliance of rebel groups in CAR, known as the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC-F), told CNN. Siddick said that the CPC-F rebels were feeling “inspired” by Assad’s ouster, stating: “Touadéra’s dismissal is imperative.” In a sign of the importance Russia places in its relationships in Africa, Vladimir Putin met Thursday with Touadéra in Moscow, in what were the Russian president’s first international talks this year.

      Russian weapons and trainers arrive in Niger weeks after US military agreement ends “This is connected to the fact that we are developing relations with the Central African Republic in all possible areas, including highly sensitive areas related to security. And we intend to develop this cooperation further,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov ahead of the meeting. Decades of conflict in CAR mirror the instability in other fragile African states where reliance on Russia’s military offerings has become increasingly prevalent, amid an aggressive push by Moscow to lessen Western influence on the continent. As Russia’s foothold in Africa expands – notably in the mineral-rich Sahel region that is beset by recurring coups, armed rebellion and extremist insurgency – anti-Western sentiments, partly fueled by Russian propaganda, are engineering the exit of Western troops from swathes of territory. The Kremlin is the most favored to fill the vacuum they leave. Ivory Coast and Chad are the latest in a string of former French colonies in West and Central Africa to demand the withdrawal of French and other Western forces from their territories, treading in the path of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Those three, all now controlled by juntas, have since turned to Russia for security support, ignoring calls from their Western ex-partners for a swift return to civilian rule. Moscow is also a sought-after partner by non-French former colonies such as Equatorial Guinea, which hosts an estimated 200 military instructors deployed by Russia in November to protect the Central African nation’s presidency. Its authoritarian leader President Teodoro Obiang, 82, has ruled the tiny, oil-rich country for 45 years following a coup in 1979. Outside West and Central Africa, Russia is bolstering its presence in the continent’s north, where Wagner forces back eastern Libya’s de facto ruler, Gen. Khalifa Haftar. Following Assad’s ouster as Syrian leader last month, Moscow has operated multiple flights to and from an airbase in eastern Libya — some headed to Mali, CNN found — suggesting a shift from the Syrian bases that have served as a hub for its military operations in Africa and the Mediterranean region. Statues honor Wagner figures in CAR In CAR, an erstwhile French colony, the Russian mercenaries that have operated in the country since 2018 have become the dominant force, following the final exit of French troops in 2022. At Thursday’s meeting with Putin, Touadéra thanked the Russian leader for supporting his nation and helping it to achieve stability. “Today, the army trained by Russian instructors is capable of repelling terrorists and anyone who encroaches on the territory of CAR. We will continue to work together to strengthen security throughout the country, at the borders, wherever the threat comes from. Russian instructors are truly professionals,” he said. The French — who deployed to CAR to help stabilize the nation after a coup in 2013 sparked a civil war — retreated over what the armed forces ministry said was CAR’s failure to halt “massive disinformation campaigns” targeting France amid a competition with Russia for influence.

      What Wagner’s post-Prigozhin future looks like on the ground in the Central African Republic French President Emmanuel Macron last week slammed African leaders for showing “ingratitude” over the deployment of his nation’s troops in the Sahel, saying that Sahel states only remained sovereign because of the arrival of French forces. Macron also dismissed the notion that French troops had been expelled from the region, adding that France was only “reorganizing itself” on the continent. “We left because there were coups d’état… France no longer had a place there because we are not the auxiliaries of putschists.” A US State Department report published last February outlined how Kremlin-funded disinformation had taken root across Africa with the creation of a pro-Russia news agency called the “African Initiative” — which, with the help of hired local journalists, markets Moscow to the continent while tarnishing the West’s reputation. CAR’s army, bolstered by Russia’s Wagner mercenaries, United Nations forces and Rwandan troops, has battled to keep armed groups such as the CPC-F at bay and reclaim territory seized by rebels. But it is the Russians who are widely credited with helping the nation stave off collapse. Statues honoring the late Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and top commander, Dmitry Utkin, were unveiled in CAR’s capital, Bangui, in December, a Telegram channel linked to the mercenary group reported. Both men were killed in a plane crash northwest of Moscow in August 2023, two months after they had launched an abortive rebellion against Russia’s military leadership. Wagner, rebranded as the Africa Corps and placed under the umbrella of the Russian defense ministry after Prigozhin’s death, still operates under the Wagner brand in CAR, where its mercenaries are possibly the group’s most active in Africa. CAR’s communications minister, Maxime Balalou, told CNN the statues were “inaugurated as part of the cooperation between our country and Russia,” adding that a bilateral defense agreement “allowed Russia to provide us with weapons” as well as “handling and training for our defense and security forces, (and) assisting our armed forces on the ground.” Another monument, depicting Wagner troops guarding a local woman and her children, was erected in Bangui three years ago. “Russia’s significant contribution helped stabilize and secure CAR,” Balalou said, adding that “at the height of CAR’s crisis, we were abandoned… but Russia responded.” Protection – at what cost? Not everyone views Russia’s involvement in Africa through a positive lens. The Kremlin’s guns-for-hire mission is far from humanitarian, according to Irina Filatova, a Russian historian specializing in African history. It’s a mixed quest for power and cash, she said, as Moscow hunts for alternative revenue to sustain its war in Ukraine amid a raft of Western sanctions. “The Russians are providing this support (to troubled African nations) in exchange for either the full control or a percentage of the control from their mineral resources. That is what Russia needs: It needs funding, and it needs influence. It helps its war in Ukraine,” Filatova, a senior research associate at the University of Cape Town, told CNN from South Africa. In CAR, Martin Ziguélé, a former prime minister and current opposition MP, told CNN that Wagner’s remuneration for providing military services to his nation “is done in an extremely hidden and discreet manner” by the Touadéra-led government. Previous CNN investigations found that companies linked to ex-Wagner leader Prigozhin had won concessions to mine gold and diamonds in CAR, where nearly 70% of the population lives in extreme poverty — the fifth highest poverty rate in the world, according to a World Bank assessment in 2023. One of those companies owns rights to the Ndassima gold mine, located 440 kilometers (273 miles) east of Bangui, whose gold proceeds are valued at over $1 billion, according to the US Treasury Department. “Authorities have no right of inspection,” Jean-Fernand Koena, who heads a union of CAR’s journalists, told CNN about what he said was Wagner’s total control of the Ndassima mine. CAR’s government, he said, cannot monitor “where the gold that they (Prigozhin-linked company) mine goes,” adding that there is “neither public accounting nor information from the ministry of mines.” CNN has contacted the mines ministry for comment. The US Treasury Department said in a statement announcing sanctions in June 2023 that the company, Midas Ressources, had “in conjunction with the Wagner Group” denied “CAR government officials the ability to inspect the Ndassima mine.” The same statement said another company affiliated with Prigozhin, named as Diamville,  had “shipped diamonds mined in the CAR to buyers in the UAE and Europe.” The Treasury  further reported that in 2022 (the year Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine), two companies – Diamville and Industrial Resources – took part in a gold-selling scheme to convert CAR-origin gold into US dollars and that the latter knowingly “participated in the transfer by hand of cash to Russia”  — in a bid to bypass US sanctions on Russian financial institutions. ‘Win-win cooperation’ A report by the World Gold Council, an international association of gold producers, puts Wagner’s earnings from its illicit gold dealings at an estimated $2.5 billion since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine. “This includes the profits from mines and refineries under Russian control, as well as retainers for security services, in CAR, Sudan and Mali,” the report said. In 2022, CNN also investigated Russia’s plunder of Sudan’s gold, uncovering more than a dozen Russian gold-smuggling flights out of the war-torn country in exchange for backing its military leadership. The following year, CNN uncovered evidence that Wagner had been arming a Sudanese militia group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which is engaged in a bitter war with Sudan’s armed forces for control of the country. Both Prigozhin and the RSF denied this at the time. For CAR, the murky underbelly of its military partnership with Russia also comes “at the cost of serious violations of human rights,” Koena said. Wagner’s alleged atrocities in Africa are widely reported. In CAR, its forces were found to have “summarily executed, tortured, and beaten civilians” since 2019, according to a 2022 report by the rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW). Balalou, the communications minister, did not address these allegations but told CNN: “We are developing a new form of win-win cooperation with Russia.” He didn’t specify what this entailed. Vladislav Ilin, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in CAR, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Outside CAR, similar atrocities, including the killing of civilians, have been committed by Wagner, the HRW claimed in another report last year, this time uncovering the group’s alleged deadly activities in Mali, where it partners with the West African nation’s military to fight insurgents. Wagner has suffered some of its worst losses on the continent in Mali. In response to a question from CNN about the nature and scope of Russia’s military partnerships on the continent, the Kremlin’s Peskov said: “We are purposefully developing our cooperation with African countries, including interaction in sensitive areas related to security.” The Russian Ministry of Defense has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment on the widespread allegations of abuse and misconduct attributed to Wagner forces in CAR and Mali. Competition for influence The Kremlin isn’t the only foreign power jostling for influence in Africa. With the US largely focused on the Middle East, China has made deep inroads into the continent over decades, expanding military ties and claiming the title of Africa’s top trading partner for the past 15 years, according to Beijing.

      Biden wraps historic Africa trip overshadowed by domestic and geopolitical controversies China has also financed tens of billions worth of development projects across Africa, including under its flagship Belt and Road global infrastructure drive launched in 2013. Projects under the initiative’s umbrella have generated accusations of lax environmental and labor standards, as well as risky lending, with critics saying China has saddled low- and middle-income governments with overly high levels of debt relative to their GDPs. Beijing has sought to push back on Western criticism over those debts. Mutasim Ali, a legal adviser at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, a Canadian NGO, told CNN that in his view, Russia and China tend to share a common trait in their dealings with Africa. “Russians and Chinese do not care about democracy, human rights violations, corruption, and the like… They’re happy to protect dictators and human rights violators. That’s one of the reasons why Russians are getting a lot more influence,” he said, contrasting their approach with Western powers such as the US and France, who prioritize democracy and human rights protections. A report by the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies in 2022 highlighted concerns over abusive labor practices, unsafe working conditions and lack of transparency among Chinese-owned companies operating in southern Africa. The Chinese Mission to the African Union has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment on the claim China does not prioritize democracy and human rights protections in its dealings with African states.

      Xi Jinping had one message for dozens of visiting African leaders: choose China China and Russia were the main arms suppliers to sub-Saharan Africa between 2019 and 2023, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Addressing African delegates at a summit in Beijing in September, President Xi Jinping claimed ties between Beijing and Africa were their “best in history,” as he pledged billions of dollars in financial support for the continent, in addition to $140 million in military aid. A Chinese foreign ministry statement issued after the summit said Beijing was committed to building a “shared future” with Africa and that “China will continue to respect African countries’ political and economic choices based on their own national conditions and honor the principles of noninterference in African countries’ internal affairs.” In Koena’s view, China’s policy of non-interference speaks to how different powers operate in Africa, with China focusing on economics and Russia on security. “In a renewed resentment against Western policy in Africa, China is imposing itself on the economic level through trade and infrastructure while Russia wants to be the military response for the stability of sometimes autocratic regimes,” he said. For Koena’s country, CAR, which has experienced decades of instability, “the message of peace and security gets across more quickly than the economy,” he added. For as long as this continues, the Russian military presence will likely be welcomed by its leaders. CNN’s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.",,0.3424275517463684
"The so-called land question has been a decades-long dilemma for South Africa. Apartheid, dismantled in the 1990s, left a deep-seeded legacy of land inequality after centuries of policies pushed non-White South Africans off the land to the benefit of White people. An act in 1913 limited Black ownership to just 7% of the land, later revised to 13%. Now, more than 100 years later, Black people make up 81% of South Africa’s population of 63 million, yet only own 4% of private land, according to a government land audit conducted in 2017. What’s the government’s plan to right the wrongs? A long-debated expropriation act signed by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month seeks to right some of the wrongs of apartheid by allowing the government to take land and redistribute it. In some circumstances, expropriation is allowed without compensation, but only where it is “just and equitable and in the public interest.” However, no seizures of private property have taken place. Emphasizing “the public interest” and that land redistribution cannot be arbitrary, proponents say the legislation is necessary. In many parts of the countryside, vast expanses of land are owned by White farmers, while Black and non-White families have been pushed out into crowded townships, as CNN previously reported. But the controversial law has brought some of South Africa’s long-standing racial tensions and inequalities to the forefront, and now it’s been seized on by United States President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who claim it discriminates against White farmers. Related article
      Trump freezes aid to South Africa over controversial land law, claiming discrimination against White farmers Musk, born in South Africa and now tasked with slashing US public spending, has accused Ramaphosa’s coalition government, led by the African National Congress (ANC) party, of having “openly racist ownership laws.” Musk’s stance has been denounced by some White South Africans. Bloemfontein resident David Van Wyk accused the billionaire of “cozying up to the extreme right-wing in the country,” which he described as “defenders of White privilege.” Van Wyk, 66, whose family owns mango and maize farms that export overseas, told CNN that Trump was “completely ignorant” about the inequalities in South Africa. “For Trump to create the impression that White people in South Africa are victims is nonsense. We (White South Africans) have incomes 10 to 20 times higher than the majority of (Black) people in South Africa,” he said, adding that “the majority of South African Black people still own nothing in the country of their ancestors.” Van Wyk said the Expropriation Act was driven by the need to address land inequalities in the country. Others, however, argue that the legislation attempts to do so “in a very clumsy manner,” according to Henk Smith, an attorney at a community-based organization, the Land Access Movement of South Africa (LAMOSA). Smith told CNN that in his view there must be a “just and equitable compensation” for every expropriated land except those reclaimed from mining companies that abuse their licenses, and state-owned enterprises not using their land productively. $440 million in US aid cut off In an executive order issued Friday, Trump revoked all aid for South Africa, saying the purpose was to hit back at their government’s “actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners,” namely White Afrikaners. He also used the order to condemn the country’s stance against Israel and its war in Gaza. Trump’s order specified that the US “shall not provide aid or assistance to South Africa” through the US Agency for International Development (USAID) or any other executive department or agency. That means the $440 million that South Africa receives in US assistance  - most going to the health sector - was immediately halted. Trump suspended nearly all US foreign aid on his first day in office, and he has taken steps to dismantle USAID, which means that many South African charities, health programs and HIV clinics have already taken a hit. “We are concerned about the potential impact of the decision by the United States government to suspend some of its funding for HIV and TB (tuberculosis) programs in African countries for 90 days. Now this funding that we get accounts for about 17% of our country’s HIV spend,” Ramaphosa told lawmakers Thursday, before the executive order, when further cuts to aid were only a threat. “We will not be deterred. We are, as South Africans, a resilient people, and we will not be bullied,” Ramaphosa said. Days later, he scrambled to send a delegation to Washington to negotiate with the Trump administration before the war of words went any further. It’s what’s not explicitly stated in the executive order that is worrying many South Africans. Fears are mounting that the Trump administration could remove the country’s eligibility from the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA), a trade act that enhances market access to the US for qualifying Sub-Saharan African nations. Removal from the trade act, which is up for renewal this year, would be a serious blow to South Africa’s agricultural industry, especially citrus farmers, and the automotive industry. ‘Disinformation’ about land seizures A spokesperson for South Africa’s Department of International Affairs has said that the misrepresentation of the land act “fuels unwarranted fears” about the targeting of White citizens. AgriSA, a trade organization for South African farmers, has also denounced claims of land seizures as “disinformation.” “The unexpected signing of the Expropriation Act on 23 January 2025 has sparked political turmoil and unnecessary tension within the agri-food system. This has been exacerbated by disinformation regarding the Act’s intent, impacting negatively on the investment climate for South African agriculture,” AgriSA chief executive Johann Kotzé said. “To be clear no seizures or confiscations of private property have taken place. Nor has any land been expropriated without compensation. Isolated cases of land grabs and trespassing have been dealt with,” Kotzé added. Meanwhile, the Solidarity Movement, a network of Afrikaner community institutions that says it represents about 600,000 members, has said it condemns “the many race laws that make us second class citizens,” including the Expropriation Act and is critical of the ANC’s foreign policy. But it doesn’t believe land grabs are taking place. “We want to put on record the following: We did not accuse the government of large-scale race-based land grabs, or distribute false information in this regard,” the movement said in a statement. “We did not and will not ask for sanctions against South Africa, or that funds for vulnerable people be cut off by the US government.” Nonetheless, Kallie Kriel, the leader of right-wing lobbying group AfriForum, which is part of the Solidarity Movement, said that Trump was correct to claim certain sectors of South African society are being treated “very badly.” “I think that is true even though people might deny it,” Kriel told Reuters. For years, AfriForum has claimed, against evidence, that there is possible ethnic cleansing and a “large-scale killing” of White farmers. Their interview with Fox News attracted a tweet from Trump in 2018, when he first weighed in on the issue. But the Institute of Security Studies (ISS), an African research group, previously told CNN that South Africa doesn’t have a farm murder problem, it has a wider murder problem. The murder rate has been steadily increasing since 2011, and violent crime affects all parts of society.",,0.20673255622386932
"A rampaging rebel group has claimed the capture of another mining town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a little over a week after it took control of the region’s largest city Goma. Clashes between the rebel coalition Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) and Congolese forces have left more than 3,000 people dead in less than two weeks, according to DRC’s government. The  AFC, of which the M23 armed group – which claims to defend the interest of minority Rwandophone communities – is a key member, took over resource-rich Nyabibwe last week after Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, fell on January 27. It comes less than a year after the rebels seized Rubaya, a mining hub also in the country’s east, which harbors one of the world’s largest deposits of coltan, a valuable mineral used in the production of smartphones. Here’s what you need to know. Is my phone fueling the conflict? For decades, DRC, a Central African nation of more than 100 million people, has grappled with bloody militia violence, including ethnic and resource-driven armed rebellion by M23 and dozens of other armed groups. Roughly the size of Western Europe, the war-riven country is endowed with vast mineral wealth, including the world’s largest reserves of cobalt and coltan – both critical to the production of electronics. Cobalt is used to produce batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles, while coltan is refined into tantalum, which has a variety of applications in phones and other devices. However, according to the World Bank “most people in DRC have not benefited from this wealth,” and the country ranks among the five poorest nations in the world. Much of DRC’s mineral wealth is split between its government and armed groups who control swathes of the resource-rich east. “Access to natural resources is at the heart of this conflict,” Jean Pierre Okenda, an analyst specializing in extractive industries governance, told CNN about the M23-led takeover of territories in the east. “It’s not a coincidence that the zones occupied by the rebels are mining areas,” Okenda said, adding that global demand for cobalt and coltan has fueled the crisis. “It takes money to wage war. Access to mining sites finances the war,” he added. Why do the rebels want the minerals? Victor Tesongo, a spokesperson for the AFC-M23 rebel alliance, told CNN that the group was in control of the coltan-rich Rubaya and Nyabibwe mines, but stopped short of saying how much money it has derived from them or what it has been spent on. But a top United Nations official has an idea. Bintou Keita, the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative to the DRC, told the Security Council in a September briefing that coltan trade from Rubaya’s mines is estimated to supply over 15 percent of global tantalum production and generates an estimated $300,000 in revenue a month for M23. M23 denied these claims, insisting its presence in Rubaya was “solely humanitarian.” Related video
      ‘I don’t know’: Rwandan president on if his country’s troops are in DR Congo Much of the international community, including the Congolese government, has accused  neighboring Rwanda of backing M23 and aiding the plunder of DRC minerals. UN experts believe that an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers are supervising and supporting M23 fighters in eastern DRC, outnumbering the rebel group’s forces in the country. A December report by the UN Group of Experts on the DRC revealed that “at least 150 tons of coltan were fraudulently exported to Rwanda and mixed with Rwandan production.” DRC Communications Minister Patrick Muyaya told CNN last week that “Rwanda’s mineral exports surged after its forces took control of key mining zones in DRC.” Rwanda is one of the world’s top suppliers of coltan and has surpassed DRC’s export of the mineral in recent years. Rwandan President Paul Kagame told CNN last week that his country gets coltan from its mines and said that he didn’t know whether Rwandan troops were in DRC. Where do DRC’s plundered minerals go? In a public address that drew outrage last year, Kagame admitted that Rwanda was a transit point for minerals smuggled from DRC, but insisted his country was not stealing from its neighbor. “Some people come from Congo; whether they smuggle or go through the right channels, they bring minerals. Most of it goes through here (Rwanda) but does not stay here. It goes to Dubai, Brussels, Tel Aviv, (and) Russia. It goes everywhere,” Kagame said, without providing evidence or specifying what minerals were being smuggled. CNN has reached out to his government’s spokesperson for comment. In 2022, the United States Treasury Department said that over 90% of DRC’s gold was being “smuggled to regional states, including Uganda and Rwanda” where they are “refined and exported to international markets, particularly the UAE,” and sanctioned a Belgian businessman for facilitating the trade. For DRC’s other valuable minerals including coltan and cobalt, the scale of the plunder remains unclear. In December, DRC sued subsidiaries of  Apple in Belgium and France, accusing the company of sourcing conflict minerals. Apple denied the accusation. Every year, tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft publish reports saying that they demand responsible sourcing of minerals from their suppliers. In an earlier filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023, Apple said that while it continued to source 3TG (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) and other minerals such as cobalt and lithium from DRC and other countries, it was “committed to meeting and exceeding internationally accepted due diligence standards for primary minerals and recycled materials in our supply chain.” It added that its due diligence efforts had “found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country.” Is there a solution to the conflict? DRC’s mineral wealth has presented itself as a “curse,” according to analyst Okenda, who explained: “These resources create wars, create rebellions, expose local populations, and also create serious ecological problems,” he told CNN. Last week, a humanitarian ceasefire announced by M23 fell apart almost immediately after it was declared, as the rebels swiftly advanced into Nyabibwe. Related article
      More than 150 female inmates raped and burned to death during Goma jailbreak in DRC, UN says While regional and global leaders ponder solutions to ending the crisis, Okenda  believes that DRC’s government needs to reinvent itself if it hopes for lasting peace. DRC “has a governance model that if it does not change, the Congolese population will gain absolutely nothing, whether there is war or not,” he said. “If the Kinshasa government improves its governance, invests in the army, ensures a fair sharing of resources between citizens in the country, and conducts elections that are of better quality, I still think that peace can return (to DRC),” he said.",,0.2821827828884125
"A contentious law that allows South Africa’s government to expropriate land – without compensation in some cases – has enraged the United States, triggering aid cuts by Washington and outbursts from President Donald Trump. Many fear that the African nation could now potentially lose some of its US trade privileges as relations between the two countries deteriorate. South Africa is the largest beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA), a US trade agreement that provides preferential duty-free access to US markets for eligible Sub-Saharan African nations. Some US lawmakers want those benefits withdrawn when AGOA is reviewed this year. What has angered the US? In January, South Africa enacted the Expropriation Act, seeking to undo the legacy of apartheid, which created huge disparities in land ownership among its majority Black and minority White population. Under apartheid, non-White South Africans were forcibly dispossessed from their lands for the benefit of Whites. Today, some three decades after racial segregation officially ended in the country, Black South Africans, who comprise over 80% of the population of 63 million, own only around 4% of private land.

      South Africa does have a history of racist land inequality. Just not in the way Trump and Musk are portraying The expropriation law empowers South Africa’s government to take land and redistribute it – with no obligation to pay compensation in some instances – if the seizure is found to be “just and equitable and in the public interest.” President Cyril Ramaphosa said the legislation would “ensure public access to land in an equitable and just manner.” But the White House disagrees. Trump and his South African-born billionaire adviser Elon Musk believe that the land reform policy discriminates against White South Africans. Sanctions have since followed. Responding to a post by Ramaphosa on X about the new legislation, Musk asked: “Why do you have openly racist ownership laws?” In an executive order issued on February 7, Trump revoked all aid for South Africa, accusing the country of human rights violations. He also denounced South Africa’s stance against Israel’s war in Gaza, saying the nation undermined US national interests. The executive order did not specify what aid was being halted but nearly $440 million was committed to South Africa in 2023 – the bulk of which went to its health sector – according to data on the US Foreign Assistance website. Ramaphosa said in a post on X before the order was issued that, “with the exception of PEPFAR Aid (the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) which constitutes 17% of South Africa’s HIVAids programme, there is no other funding that is received by South Africa from the United States.” Economist Ndumiso Kubheka told CNN that South Africa could be on the verge of losing its trade benefits with the US under AGOA. “Based on the changes in trade policy and national interests of the US government, the possibility of changes and South Africa’s exclusion does exist,” he said. To remain eligible for AGOA, a benefiting nation “must demonstrate respect for rule of law, human rights … (and) should also not seek to undermine US foreign policy interests,” according to requirements outlined on its website. In a letter to Trump on February 11, US Rep. Andy Ogles and three other Republican congressmen called for South Africa’s duty-free access to the US market to be withdrawn and for diplomatic ties to be suspended, expressing disapproval of its land reforms, its alleged “vendetta against Israel” and its “embrace of China.” What happens if South Africa is cut off from AGOA? South Africa’s exports are partly driven by agriculture, which accounted for 10% of the country’s total export earnings in 2021, according to the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC). South Africa is the main agricultural exporter under AGOA and its largest beneficiary, according to the US Department of Agriculture. In a 2023 report, the department said that two-thirds of South Africa’s agricultural exports to the US “are exported tariff-free under AGOA,” with exporters of citrus, wine and fruit juice among the top beneficiaries. Victor Thindisa, a senior manager for Markets and Economic Research at NAMC, told CNN that removing the nation from AGOA would deal a serious blow to its agricultural industry. “South Africa is likely to face higher tariffs of about 3% for agricultural exports to the USA should the country be ineligible for AGOA benefits,” he said. “The loss of preferential market access for the agricultural sector could lead to reduced foreign exchange earnings, decreased competitiveness of South African agricultural products in the USA, and potential job losses,” Thindisa added.

      White South Africans gather in support of Trump and his claims that they are victims of racism The move might also run counter to the Trump administration’s apparent aims. Stripping South Africa of its AGOA privileges on account of its expropriation law would hurt the same White farmers whom the US seeks to protect, according to Chrispin Phiri, a spokesperson for the country’s foreign minister. “If you look at the produce that finds its way into the US markets, it primarily comes from our agricultural sector, which is primarily White farmers,” Phiri told CNN. He added that: “It’s a known fact that most of our commercial farmers are White. They are the ones who are in the majority in the commercial agricultural sector, and they have a commercial gain from an agreement like AGOA. So, the very same people that you believe are being persecuted would be persecuted by such a volatile decision.” Citrus grower Gerrit van der Merwe, who exports to the US from Citrusdal in the Western Cape province, told CNN that South Africa’s likely exclusion from AGOA would lead to job cuts. “It would affect us considerably and threaten local jobs,” he said. “It is difficult to estimate precisely to what extent. Citrus is the economic heart of Citrusdal, and any shocks or changes in the industry affect the entire rural community.” Justin Chadwick, who heads South Africa’s Citrus Growers Association (CGA), said the group was concerned about the situation. “If AGOA is not renewed, it will create a challenging environment for South African citrus. AGOA ensures our citrus isn’t subject to US tariffs. A US tariff on South African citrus would make our fruit more expensive for American consumers.” Chadwick told CNN that thousands of rural jobs were at risk. “To give you an idea of how many jobs are currently connected to US citrus export: an estimated 35,000 local jobs from farm level throughout the supply chain as well as an additional 20,000 jobs in the US are sustained by US-SA citrus exports. Without AGOA, these jobs will surely be under threat.” At least 100,000 pallets of citrus are shipped to the US from South Africa annually, he said, adding that “South Africa’s entire North American exports make up around 9% of our total citrus exports.” Are there other markets to turn to? Outside the Americas region, which accounted for 6% of South Africa’s agricultural exports in 2024, the African continent is the main market for the country’s agricultural goods, making up 42% of its agricultural exports, according to the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa (Agbiz). Other export destinations include Asia and the Middle East, which together totaled 21%, and the European Union, which made up 19% of South Africa’s agricultural exports for 2024, Agbiz data showed.

      How Trump’s USAID cuts impact women in South Africa Despite the comparatively lower trade volume, the US market “matters significantly,” according to Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist at Agbiz. “Firstly, the exports (to the US) are concentrated in specific industries, mainly nuts, citrus, wines, grapes, and fruit juices. This means while the risks associated with this market are not as significant in proportion to overall agricultural exports, they present challenges to specific industries,” he said. Secondly, Sihlobo said, “the negative sentiment arising from any confrontation with the Americas region would have negative effects on South Africa’s agriculture.It is, therefore, vital that South Africa maintains positive agricultural relations with this region.” For the citrus grower Van der Merwe, finding an alternative destination for his produce if South Africa is removed from AGOA and exporting to the US becomes less profitable would not be easy. “We would still probably export quantities (of) citrus to the US, but given that the usual tariffs would then apply, it would be a big setback,” he said. “South African citrus is valued in other markets like the Middle East and the EU, and switching to those markets if it is more profitable can be considered. But the volume of exports for us to the US is large, it will be difficult for it to be absorbed elsewhere.” Can South Africa mend its ties with the US? South African leader Ramaphosa said on Thursday he was ready to “do a deal” with the US to repair their plummeting relations. “We would like to go to the United States to do a deal,” he said while responding to questions from Richard Gnodde, vice chairman of US bank Goldman Sachs, during a conference in Johannesburg. “We don’t want to go and explain ourselves,” he added. “We want to go and do a meaningful deal with the United States on a whole range of issues.” Ramaphosa did not specify what the deal would entail but noted it would span trade, diplomatic and political issues. “We decided that it’s not best to have a knee-jerk reaction,” Ramaphosa said of Trump’s executive order cutting aid to his nation. “We wanted to let the dust settle.”",,0.2190600335597992
"Editor’s Note: Warning: This story contains descriptions of rape and sexual violence. Sixteen-year-old Darkuna watched, terrified, as six gun-wielding men ransacked her home. “For God’s sake, what do you really want?” she cried. One of the fighters looked directly at the girl and responded: “I want you.” After stealing the family’s valuables, each of the armed men raped Darkuna and her 18-year-old sister. Their parents, helpless, were forced to watch. Darkuna is a pseudonym for the teenager, who provided this testimony to the United Nations’ children’s agency UNICEF via a partner organization on the ground in Goma, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Fighting has escalated in the mineral-rich region since the rebel coalition Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), of which the notorious M23 armed group is a key member, captured key territory earlier this year – including Goma, which as of late January was home to about 3 million people, of whom 1 million were displaced, according to a February Relief Web report. The conflict has exacerbated what’s been described as an epidemic of rape and sexual violence that aid groups say often victimizes the youngest and most vulnerable. “The scale of sexual violence against children in eastern DRC is beyond a crisis – it is a tragedy. We are seeing an alarming increase in cases, not seen in years, with many young survivors bearing the unimaginable scars of war,” Ramatou Toure, chief of child protection for UNICEF in the DRC, told CNN. At CNN’s request, UNICEF and Save the Children shared testimony gathered from survivors of rape who sought treatment at clinics affiliated with those organizations. The names of the victims and any details that might identify them have been withheld for their protection, with pseudonyms used throughout instead. Their accounts shed light on how rape is a horrifically common aspect of the conflict in the DRC, often committed with impunity against women and girls of all ages. ‘My grandmother could do nothing’ In January, the rampaging AFC rebel coalition stormed Goma and clashed with the Congolese military. Electricity, basic services and water were cut off, while running street battles plunged the city into days of unrelenting violence that claimed some 7,000 lives. The bodies of the dead filled the streets. Trapped in this hellscape was 14-year-old Mudaralla, an orphan. She heard the gunfire and artillery explosions grow louder and closer to the home she shared with her only guardian, her elderly grandmother. This is her account, as shared with CNN. “Two men with guns forced their way into our home. My grandmother could do nothing but watch as they raped me. She cried, but she was powerless. We kept it a secret. I didn’t tell anyone. My grandmother was too ashamed and afraid,” Mudaralla’s account reads. “My grandmother’s biggest fear is that I might be pregnant or have contracted an infection. I don’t know what the future holds.” Mudaralla’s rape remained a secret until about a month after the assault, when a community outreach worker, affiliated with UNICEF, visited her neighborhood and encouraged her to receive treatment. Countless more girls suffer in silence and, even for those who seek help, medical care and psychological support are scant. “Survivors are facing severe barriers to accessing immediate care due to the ongoing conflict,” Greg Ramm, Save the Children’s country director for DRC, told CNN. “The scale of these violations is staggering and incomprehensible.” Some 400,000 people were displaced by the outbreak of fighting earlier this year, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR. In the chaos, hundreds of children were separated from their families, leaving them even more at risk of sexual violence by parties to the conflict, according to UNICEF. Children raped while fetching water For families that managed to remain together, there is no safe place to go and little infrastructure to protect them from the armed factions. Aid workers with Save the Children say fetching water from a well is one of the most dangerous activities for children in the conflict zone. “My two daughters, one aged 15 and the other aged 13, became victims of rape this morning,” a mother’s testimony reads. “When they were going to draw water, six armed men isolated them and raped them in turn. I wanted to intervene, but I had just escaped death after being shot at twice. My daughters are in very critical condition. Please pray for them.” Another account received by Save the Children details the assault of a young girl who, while drawing water near her home, was captured by armed fighters who tried to force themselves on her. When she resisted, the men shot the girl twice in the back. She survived and received medical treatment. The AFC rebel group, which is accused of serious human rights violations, continues its rapid advance in the eastern regions of the DRC, most recently claiming control of the strategic city of Bukavu, where aid workers say they are already receiving reports of more child rape victims. For survivors there is little prospect of justice. While allegations of rape are skyrocketing amid the latest fighting, sexual violence has haunted the DRC through decades of conflict, particularly in its mineral-rich east. In 2024 alone, tens of thousands of children received support after surviving sexual violence or rape, according to Save the Children. Rape is a weapon of war wielded by all parties to the conflict at a staggering rate, but most cases of sexual violence are never investigated or prosecuted, and very few are even reported, according to the UN. Rights groups say impunity protects and encourages perpetrators, fueling a cycle of rape and violence that has been accelerated by the surge in fighting. This year, with the conflict spiraling out of control, aid workers fear a generation of children will be physically and mentally scarred by such attacks. “Every day, we witness the devastating impact of sexual violence on children – some too young to even understand what has happened to them. We are providing urgent essential care, but no one should remain indifferent,” Toure said.",,0.3552680015563965
"A rebel alliance claimed the capture of the biggest city in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s mineral-rich eastern region this week, pushing back against resistance from government troops backed by regional and UN intervention forces. The takeover of Goma is yet another territorial gain for the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) rebel coalition, which includes the M23 armed group – sanctioned by the United States and the United Nations. It is also a swift expansion of the alliance’s foothold across swathes of eastern DR Congo – where rare minerals crucial to the production of phones and computers are mined – and is likely to worsen a long-running humanitarian crisis in the region. “AFC-M23 controls Goma,” Victor Tesongo, an AFC spokesperson, told CNN Monday, adding that “Goma fell under pressure” after the group’s earlier seizure of the nearby towns of Minova and Saké. The Congolese government has yet to confirm the rebels’ takeover but acknowledges their presence in the city, capital of the eastern North Kivu province. It announced Sunday it had cut diplomatic ties with neighboring Rwanda, which it accuses of equipping the group with both weapons and troops, and recalled its diplomatic staff from the nation. A Rwandan government spokesperson did not deny or confirm the country’s support for M23 when asked by CNN. More than a dozen foreign peacekeepers, as well as the military governor of North Kivu province, have been killed in recent days trying to fend off the rebels, as thousands of locals flee their advance into Goma. What are the latest developments? South Africa’s military confirmed Tuesday that four more South African soldiers deployed in DR Congo as part of the UN peacekeeping mission there had died, only days after nine were killed in the fighting. Meanwhile, aid agencies said that hospitals were overwhelmed as hundreds of people caught in the crossfire in Goma sought treatment for injuries, among them seriously wounded children. Amid the fighting, food assistance programs in and around the city have been temporarily paused, the World Food Programme said Tuesday. There were “many dead bodies” in the city’s streets, said Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office. Fighters had reportedly raped civilians, and property had also been looted, he said. Among those killed was a famed Congolese boxer, Balezi Bagunda, according to Matthew Leutwyler, the founder of the non-profit We Are Limitless, who had been working with him to evacuate local children the organization works with. The Red Cross warned on Tuesday that the unrest in the city could lead to the spread of viruses, including Ebola, if laboratories with samples of the disease are affected by the violence. Patrick Youssef, regional director for Africa at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said that his organization is “very concerned” that a biomedical laboratory in Goma could be impacted by the disorder there. “It’s a center very close to our delegation,” he said. Meanwhile, in the national capital, Kinshasa, protesters gathered and fires were lit outside a number of Western and African embassies, including that of Rwanda. The French embassy was “attacked and firebombed,” the French foreign ministry told CNN, but protesters were unable to enter the site’s perimeter. Later on Tuesday, the US Embassy in Kinshasa advised US citizens to leave the city. “Due to an increase in violence throughout the city of Kinshasa, the US Embassy in Kinshasa advises US citizens to shelter-in-place and then safely depart while commercial options are available,” a statement from the embassy said. Reports emerged Monday of Congolese troops exchanging fire with Rwandan soldiers along their shared border as fear of a blown-out war grows. Earlier that day, gunfire rang out from Goma’s airport after it was shut by the rebels; a French intelligence source told CNN M23 had gained full control of the facility on Tuesday. At the same time, more than 4,000 prisoners broke free from a correctional facility, the UN-funded Radio Okapi reported, compounding chaotic scenes witnessed in the city. In a statement Monday, the Uruguayan army, whose troops are part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Goma, said “hundreds” of Congolese soldiers had laid down their weapons following a 48-hour ultimatum by M23. Rwandan national broadcaster also shared footage of Congolese soldiers surrendering their arms to Rwandan forces at a Rwandan border post after fleeing Goma. How did the conflict escalate? DR Congo has experienced decades of militia violence, including armed rebellion by M23, which claims to defend the interest of the minority Rwandophone communities, including the Tutsi. Since 2022, M23 has waged a renewed rebellion against the Congolese government, occupying a large expanse in North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda. For several months, the rebels have also controlled Rubaya, a mining town in North Kivu that harbors one of the world’s largest coltan deposits. This valuable mineral is used in the production of mobile phones. Bintou Keita, who heads the UN mission in DR Congo, told the Security Council in a September briefing that “competition over exploitation and trade of natural resources” had escalated conflict between armed groups in the country’s east. According to Keita, coltan trade from the M23-controlled Rubaya mining site is estimated to “supply over 15 percent of global tantalum production”, and “generates an estimated $300,000 in revenue per month to the armed group.” M23 denied these claims, insisting its presence in the Rubaya area was “solely humanitarian.” A report by the UN Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo, released in December, revealed that “at least 150 tons of coltan were fraudulently exported to Rwanda and mixed with Rwandan production.” Since April last year, the report said, M23, “with RDF (Rwanda Defence Force) support, has made significant territorial gains and strengthened control over occupied areas,” adding that such a pattern suggested “that the true objective of M23 remained territorial expansion and the long-term occupation and exploitation of conquered territories.” The report added that the RDF’s military interventions “were critical to the impressive territorial expansion achieved” by M23. Why is Goma important? Goma is home to around two million people and is the largest city in North Kivu. M23’s incursion on Monday was the second time the group had moved to capture the provincial capital after it briefly took control in 2012. M23 spokesman Willy Ngoma told CNN on Saturday that his group was motivated by concern for the residents of Goma, which is home to minority groups such as the Congolese Tutsi community. “We do not want to capture Goma but to liberate it,” he said. “The population is in distress; we must save it as quickly as possible.” Prof. Dady Saleh, a Congolese political and economic analyst, told CNN there was more to M23’s interest in Goma. “Goma is a strategic and highly symbolic city with an international airport, as well as proximity to Rwanda and Lake Kivu, opening the easy path with South Kivu,” he said. But, most importantly, Saleh said, Goma’s fall to M23 “will be the symbol of its complete and total capture” of the eastern part of the DRC.” M23’s self-proclaimed liberation agenda has been scarred by a long trail of alleged human rights violations and what rights group Human Rights Watch described in 2023 as “war crimes against civilians” in North Kivu. The group has consistently denied such claims. Fighting between M23, Congolese forces and other rebel groups has also forced many from their homes in the country’s east, with at least 400,000 people displaced just since the beginning of this year in North and South Kivu, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR said in a statement. UNHCR spokesperson Matt Saltmarsh added that “bombs have fallen” on camps housing those who’ve fled, resulting in civilian deaths, including of children. This is a huge concern for aid groups operating in the area, such as Mercy Corps. Its country director for DR Congo, Rose Tchwenko, told CNN in a statement that Goma, which she described as a “lifeline of humanitarian operations across eastern DRC” was now “perilously close to breaking.” “Humanitarian access is nearly impossible, resources are stretched to their limits, and displaced families are left in dire need of food, clean water, medicine, and shelter,” Tchwenko said. What’s at stake for Rwanda? UN experts believe that an estimated 3,000 Rwandan soldiers operate alongside M23 fighters in eastern DR Congo, outnumbering the rebel group’s number in the country. According to Saleh, the Congolese analyst, Rwanda does not just support M23, “it (Rwanda) is the M23.” Western nations, such as the US, Britain, and France, have censured Kigali’s support for the group. Rwanda government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told CNN that her country “will do what is necessary to defend our borders and protect Rwandans.” She cited a UN report that found evidence DR Congo’s military had collaborated and carried out joint operations with a Hutu militia group against a mainly Tutsi rebel group, the CNDP, which M23 grew out of. Hutu militias carried out the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994. “This is happening right next to our border,” Makolo said of the insecurity in eastern DR Congo, adding that “the President of the DRC has said publicly that his enemy is President (Paul) Kagame and the Rwandan Government, and that he will ‘liberate’ Rwandans.” Rwanda’s foreign ministry also blamed DR Congo’s government for failing to engage in dialogue with M23, describing it as a “Congolese rebel group fighting to protect their community in eastern DRC.” CNN has contacted the Congolese military and government spokesperson for comment on the country’s alleged collaboration with the Hutu militia group and threats against Rwanda. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi has previously threatened to go to war with Rwanda. Rwandan leader Kagame has responded in kind. “We are ready to fight,” Kagame told French network France 24 in June last year, adding: “We are not afraid of anything.” When the UN Security Council convened on Sunday for an emergency meeting on the crisis, DR Congo’s foreign minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner said Rwanda’s role in the conflict was “a declaration of war that no longer hides itself behind diplomatic maneuvers.” Is there a route to peace? Eastern African leaders plan to convene an emergency meeting within 48 hours to find solutions to the crisis, Kenya’s President William Ruto said Monday, urging Tshisekedi and Kagame “to heed the call for peace.” Previous interventions led by Angola, including truce agreements, have failed to cease hostilities.

"A peace deal ending a conflict that killed tens of thousands in South Sudan is in danger of collapsing, raising fears that the world’s youngest nation — and one of its poorest — could swiftly lapse back into war. South Sudan split from the rest of Sudan in 2011 after decades of pro-independence unrest but has struggled to keep the peace in its territory, which is divided along ethnic lines. It plunged into a civil war in 2013 and then again three years later, until the violence was stopped by a fragile ceasefire agreement in 2018. What’s the current crisis about? The nation is governed by a coalition government, led by President Salva Kiir and five vice presidents, who include Kiir’s rival Riek Machar, the leader of the SPLM/A-IO party. Machar was arrested this week, prompting the SPLM/A-IO to issue a statement Thursday saying his detention “effectively brings the (peace) agreement (between him and Kiir) to a collapse.” “The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,” it added. CNN has asked the SPLM/A-IO what it thinks could happen next but has not heard back. Machar’s arrest followed the sacking and arrest of other prominent officials from the SPLM/A-IO, as well as the arrival of troops from neighboring Uganda at Kiir’s invitation to help South Sudan’s military fight a local militia. The SPLM/A-IO condemned what it called “military aggression against civilians” by the Ugandan forces. Machar also condemned Uganda’s military intervention in a letter to the United Nations’ secretary-general on March 23, saying it violated the terms of the peace deal. South Sudan has never held a national election. Its current government is the result of a power-sharing agreement struck in 2018 between Kiir and Machar. The deal ended a five-year-civil war, which killed an estimated 400,000 people. South Sudan is polarized between the majority Dinka tribe, which Kiir hails from, and Machar’s Nuer ethnic group, the second-largest in the country. Clashes this month in the town of Nasir between government forces and a Nuer militia known as the White Army have shaken the nation’s fragile peace. Dozens have been killed in the clashes, local media reported. On Friday, authorities confirmed Machar’s arrest, accusing him of encouraging the militia to overrun a military base in Nasir and attack a UN helicopter. The White Army, for its part, denies ties with Machar or his party. Information minister Michael Makuei said in a statement sent to CNN that since the beginning of March Machar had been “agitating” a rebellion against the government “with the aim of disrupting peace so that elections are not held and South Sudan goes back to war.” He cited “intelligence and security reports.” Makuei added that Machar and “his anti-peace colleagues of the SPLM/A-IO” – which he said preached hate and tribalism – “will be investigated and brought to book accordingly.” The SPLM/A-IO has not commented on these allegations. What’s the world saying? UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric has warned that Machar’s arrest and the unrest in the country were taking the nation “one step closer to the edge of a collapse into civil war.” “The peace agreement is in shambles,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Friday and called for de-escalation. He added that the clashes were “darkly reminiscent” of the earlier civil wars. Western nations have also sought to cool tempers. In a joint statement Thursday, the embassies of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Netherlands and Norway in South Sudan, as well as the European Union delegation urged Kiir to reverse Machar’s arrest and called for a ceasefire between armed groups.

      Infants and young children are being raped as a weapon of war in Sudan, UNICEF says In a sign of the fragile situation in the country, the US embassy has urged Americans to flee South Sudan while they still can. Similar advice was issued by Britain. The African Union, which comprises 55 African nations, has said it will deploy a delegation to Juba, the capital of South Sudan, “to de-escalate the situation.” Separately, an envoy of William Ruto, the president of neighboring Kenya, arrived in Juba Friday and held talks with Kiir. “I am encouraged by the possibility of a resolution to the conflict,” Raila Odinga said after the meeting, adding he would brief East African leaders on “a possible roadmap to sustainable peace and stability.” ‘A country on the edge’ In October, the World Bank made a bleak assessment of the situation. Violence, weak management of public resources and “political contestation” have “intensified existing humanitarian needs,” it said. And in a report in December, it said that more than two-thirds of the population in the oil-rich nation were extremely poor, living on less than $2.15 per day. Despite its economic troubles, South Sudan harbors more than half a million refugees from war-torn neighbors Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, based on data from the UN Refugee Agency.

"The president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has commuted the death sentences of three Americans convicted of attempting a coup to life imprisonment, days before US government officials are due to visit the central African country. The Americans, Marcel Malanga, Tyler Thompson Jr., and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun were among 37 people handed death sentences by a military court in September following last year’s failed coup attempt led by Malanga’s father, Christian. The putschists had targeted the country’s presidential palace and the residence of Congolese politician Vital Kamerhe in an attempt to overthrow the government in May 2024. At least six people, including Christian Malanga, an opposition politician who livestreamed the coup attempt, were killed in a gun battle with presidential guards. President Felix Tshisekedi granted the Americans clemency in a presidential order read out on national television late Tuesday, his spokesperson Tina Salama told CNN. “The clemency petition was filed by the public prosecutor, and it was on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice,” Salama added. CNN has contacted Justice Minister Constant Mutamba for comment. Related article
      Americans involved in foiled deadly coup, DR Congo military says Salama said the clemency decision was not made to placate the US, with whom the DRC has sought a minerals-for-security partnership. It comes as war rages in the country’s resource-rich eastern region between government forces and a Rwanda-backed rebel group. “We have no deal with the Americans at this stage on any American intervention,” Salama said. A spokesperson for the US State Department told CNN the US is aware of the DRC’s announcement that it is commuting the Americans’ sentences. “Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment,” the statement said. The new US Senior Adviser for Africa Massad Boulos and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Corina Sanders will travel to the DRC Thursday, the State Department announced this week. The officials aim to ”advance efforts for durable peace in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and to promote US private sector investment in the region,” it noted. They also plan to visit neighboring Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya. CNN’s Lex Harvey contributed reporting.",,0.24614465236663818
"South Sudan has reversed its decision to deny entry to a man it said was a Congolese national deported by the United States after Washington imposed a blanket visa ban on South Sudanese citizens. In a dramatic U-turn on Tuesday, South Sudan’s foreign ministry said the government had chosen to admit the deportee, identified as Makula Kintu, “in the spirit of the friendly relations between South Sudan and the United States.” US President Donald Trump has heavily cracked down on immigration since his return to power in January and has launched a series of deportation actions in recent months. On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that visas held by South Sudanese citizens were being revoked and no new visas would be granted to people from the country over their government’s failure to receive deportees “in a timely manner.” South Sudan, the world’s youngest nation and one of its poorest is already troubled by armed conflict in its northern region that threatens to plunge it back into another civil war.

      The world’s youngest country fought for decades to govern itself. Now it’s on the cusp of another civil war On Monday, the South Sudanese foreign ministry clarified that Kintu arrived at the Juba International Airport in the country’s capital on Saturday with a travel document that was not his. According to the ministry, he presented “a South Sudanese travel document under the name Nimeri Garang” to immigration officials. However, a series of verifications revealed that he was not  Garang and instead identified him as Kintu — a citizen of the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). “He (Kintu) was not admitted (into South Sudan) and was subsequently returned to the sending country (the US) for further processing,” it added. The ministry explained it was awaiting the arrival of the actual Garang, whom it said the South Sudanese embassy in Washington had been notified by the US State Department of his deportation and scheduled arrival in Juba next month. US authorities are yet to comment on the nationality discrepancy. The South Sudanese foreign ministry cited information on Kintu’s travel history supplied by the US Department of Homeland Security which stated that he initially arrived in the US in 2003 “and voluntarily departed for the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2009.” It added that Kintu “re-entered the United States illegally on July 10, 2016” and that while he was being questioned Saturday by immigration officials at the Juba airport, Kintu “stated that he hails from the Ema tribe of the Northern Kivu Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and added that he was brought to South Sudan against his will.” In its latest communication Tuesday, the ministry noted that Kintu would nonetheless be allowed to enter South Sudan when he arrives again on Wednesday. “The Government of the Republic of South Sudan remains committed to supporting the return of verified South Sudanese nationals who are scheduled for deportation from the United States,” the foreign ministry said.",,0.21395531296730042
"At least 50 hippos and other large animals have been killed by anthrax poisoning in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo’s Virunga National Park and have been spotted floating along a major river that feeds one of Africa’s great lakes, the head of the park said on Tuesday. Tests confirmed anthrax poisoning, said Virunga Park director Emmanuel De Merode, adding that buffalo have been killed too. The exact cause of the poisoning was not yet clear. Images shared by the park show the hippopotamuses motionless on their sides and backs in the Ishasha River, or caught among foliage on the river’s muddy banks. The deaths represent a major loss for the park, which has been working to increase the number of hippos in recent decades after poaching and war reduced the population from over 20,000 to a few hundred by 2006. The park now holds about 1,200 hippos. Park guards noticed there was a problem when the dead animals started to appear about five days ago along the river, which forms Congo’s border with Uganda and runs through an area under the control of rebel fighters.

      Anthrax is killing wildlife, and it’s putting humans at risk, too Anthrax is a serious disease usually caused by bacteria found naturally in soil. Wild animals can become infected if they inhale anthrax spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. In a statement on Tuesday, the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation warned residents to avoid wildlife in the area and to boil water from local sources before drinking. De Merode said that a team was on site and that they were trying to get the hippos out of the water and bury them, but that it was difficult because they did not have excavators. “It’s difficult due to lack of access and logistics,” De Merode told Reuters. “We have the means to limit the spread (of the disease) by…burying them with caustic soda.” The river runs north to Lake Edward, where locals spotted more corpses. “There are more than 25 hippopotamus bodies floating in the waters of the lake, from Kagezi to Nyakakoma,” Thomas Kambale, a civil society leader in Nyakakoma, told Reuters.

"Sudan’s army says it has wrested control of the capital Khartoum from a feared militia accused of genocide after ousting it from the Presidential Palace and the city’s airport it had held since the start of a brutal two-year conflict. But while the capture of Khartoum marks an important moment in the conflict, with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) deeply embedded elsewhere in Sudan and attempting to form a parallel government, analysts warn there is little likelihood of a swift resolution to the war. Since April 2023, two of Sudan’s most powerful generals – Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who leads the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and former ally Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – have engaged in a bloody feud over control of the country which is split between their strongholds. The ruthless power struggle, which was essentially triggered by disagreements on how to restore civilian rule after the fall of former President Omar al-Bashir and a subsequent military coup, has left more than 28,000 people dead and 11 million homeless in what the United Nations has described as the world’s “most devastating humanitarian and displacement crisis.” The military claims control of swaths of Sudan but almost all of Darfur, a region roughly the size of France, is held by the RSF, which also retains footholds in the neighboring states of West Kordofan and North Kordofan, according to a map released by the SAF. The RSF has battled to maintain its presence in Khartoum, but a streak of losses in recent weeks has forced the militia to flee its key positions within the city. On Wednesday, the SAF posted a video on social media which it said showed RSF fighters fleeing Khartoum, hours after it reclaimed the airport. CNN has contacted the RSF for comment. SAF spokesman Nabil Abdullah told CNN on Wednesday that only “small pockets here and there that are being cleared out” remain. “Khartoum is free,” declared SAF leader Burhan, who arrived at Khartoum’s airport by plane later Wednesday, in what the army said was the first flight received by the airport since the start of the war. Yasser al-Atta, a deputy commander of the SAF told troops on Tuesday that the “decisive battle” to “eliminate the (RSF’s) rebellion” was now “in its final phase.” Where’s the next battlefield? Sudanese pro-democracy activist and researcher Hala Al-Karib told CNN that the battle for territorial control could potentially shift to Darfur, where the RSF is more entrenched and seeks to establish a parallel government. The RSF grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militia that was accused of genocide against the non-Arab population in Darfur in the early 2000s. In January, the United States accused the RSF of committing another genocide following what it said was the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.” The RSF denounced the declaration as “inaccurate.” “It (Darfur) is the RSF stronghold where they started as the Janjaweed and where they fought and continue to fight for land grabbing from the African indigenous population who own the land,” Al-Karib said. SAF spokesman Abdullah told CNN that the army would not reveal its intentions when asked about the possibility of combat shifting to Darfur. But he added the war is far from over. “The journey is still long because our goal is to cleanse the entire country.” Civilians paying the price Ridding the country of the RSF has come at a great cost for the Sudanese people who are often caught in the crossfire. Civilians in North Darfur are the latest casualties of the conflict. On Monday, many people were burned beyond recognition when bombs rained on a busy market in Tora, a rebel-run village in North Darfur, according to multiple local reports, as Sudan’s military targeted RSF enclaves. The RSF shared footage of charred bodies in a Telegram post, accusing the SAF of carrying out a series of airstrikes targeting the market and nearby homes that left over 400 people dead. CNN could not verify the number of casualties. Volker Türk, a UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement he was “deeply shocked” by the reports, saying that 13 of those victims were from a single family. “Civilian objects remain an all-too-frequent target,” he added. SAF spokesman Abdullah told CNN that civilians with no ties to the RSF are not targeted by the military. “We are the ones protecting civilians and preserving their lives and property, unlike the militia, which has continued since the outbreak of this war to bombard civilians with drones, artillery, and missiles,” he said. Is Sudan headed for a reset or division? The SAF’s military successes in Khartoum could further fracture Sudan or make the RSF “more amenable to being pushed into talks” with its rival, political analyst Kholood Khair said. Previous negotiations mediated by the US, Saudi Arabia and the African Union reached a deadlock. Bringing the SAF and RSF back to the table won’t be simple, Khair told CNN. “This war has added an ugly ethnic taint to the political and economic conflicts that will be difficult to resolve even with a national level agreement,” she added. In February, the RSF began an audacious move to create a parallel government in the areas under its control, signing a charter with political and smaller armed groups allied to it that seek the “establishment of a secular and democratic state based on freedom, equality, and justice.” The RSF’s proposed state is “a quest for legitimacy,” according to Khair, who anticipates that the militia could now “seek to capture El Fasher” — the last major town in Darfur yet to be under its control. Sudanese human rights lawyer Mutasim Ali believes that the RSF lacks the capacity to create a parallel state as it has been cut down to size by the SAF. “The RSF does not necessarily control the entire people of Darfur even though it has a widespread presence across the region. From a practical standpoint, I see it (dividing Sudan) as a difficult thing to achieve especially considering the SAF taking over a bunch of places,” he told CNN. For activist Al-Karib, the RSF’s move to form a separate government is “a pressure card on (the) SAF to engage with them and to legitimize themselves as a political force in case of any political talks.” As of today, the prospects for negotiations that could potentially usher in a coalition government between the SAF and RSF appear to be a long shot.

      Infants and young children are being raped as a weapon of war in Sudan, UNICEF says The SAF’s deputy commander Al-Atta told troops this week: “There will be no retreat or stop until the militia and its collaborating agents are eradicated from the lives of the Sudanese.” With the military presumed to have the upper hand, it will likely press on, Ali said. “Surely the conflict is far from over, but I believe (the) SAF will now have a major advantage. In the meantime, to reclaim legitimacy, (the) SAF will institute a government that will be less open to negotiations and further insist on military victory,” he told CNN.",,0.2930699288845062
"Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates at the United Nations’ top court of violating the Genocide Convention by supporting paramilitary forces in its Darfur region. “A genocide is being committed against the ethnic group of the Masalit in the west of our country,” Sudan’s acting justice minister, Muawia Osman, told the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, on Thursday. He alleged that a genocide was being carried out by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces “with the support and complicity of the United Arab Emirates.” Sudan last month filed a case against the UAE at the court for allegedly arming the RSF, an accusation that the UAE has repeatedly denied. The UAE on Thursday reiterated its rejection of Sudan’s accusations, calling them “baseless and politically driven,” adding that it “supports neither side” in the Sudanese civil war, and that there is no evidence to support Sudan’s claims. In its statement to the court, it questioned the ICJ’s jurisdiction over the matter. “Our only interest is in securing a lasting peace that ends the suffering of the Sudanese people and brings stability to Sudan and the wider region,” Reem Ketait, Assistant Deputy Minister of Political Affairs in the UAE foreign ministry, told CNN. Since April 2023, two of Sudan’s most powerful generals – Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who leads the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and former ally Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary RSF – have engaged in a bloody feud over control of the country which is split between their strongholds. The ongoing civil war has caused one of the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophes and diplomatic efforts to bring the conflict to an end have failed. Based in The Hague, Netherlands, the ICJ deals with disputes between states and violations of international treaties. Sudan and the UAE are both signatories of the 1948 Genocide Convention. Osman alleged that “direct logistic and other support” the UAE provided to the RSF and allied militias “has been, continues to be the primary driving force behind the genocide” including “killing, rape, forced displacement, looting and the destruction of public and private properties.” Cases before the ICJ can take years to reach a final decision, and so states can ask the court to issue emergency measures that prevent the conflict from escalating. The Sudanese minister asked the court to urgently order the UAE “to refrain from any conduct amounting to complicity” in the alleged genocide against the Masalit, and that the Gulf state submit a report to the court within one month, and then every six months until the court comes to a final decision on the case. UAE accuses Sudan of ‘cynical PR stunt’ The United States in January found attacks against the Masalit to be genocide. Last year, a UN panel of experts found that the UAE’s involvement, along with that of Chad, in the conflict was “credible.” US lawmakers have also said they would hold all major US arms sales to the UAE for “its support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who the United States determined committed genocide.” Sudan’s lawyers referenced a recent Sudanese government intelligence assessment provided to the court which they said showed clear evidence that UAE-backed arms deliveries to the RSF through neighboring Chad “continue even today.” CNN has reported extensively on the atrocities committed by the RSF and its allied militias: a gruesome massacre of non-Arab people, including the Masalit, in the West Darfur capital of El Geneina, a campaign to enslave men and women there, as well as forced recruitment in Sudan’s central Al Jazira state. The UAE has repeatedly rejected Sudan’s allegations, with Ketait on Thursday accusing the nation of weaponizing the ICJ “for disinformation.” Ketait told CNN that the accusations are “nothing more than a cynical PR stunt” by the Sudan Armed Forces, adding that it is “an attempt to deflect from its own well-documented atrocities against the Sudanese people and its refusal to cease fire or engage in genuine negotiations.” After nearly two years of fighting, civilians continue to pay the price of war The humanitarian situation in Sudan has deteriorated since fighting broke out in April 2023. Today, about 25 million people, or half the population, faces severe hunger with famine declared in five areas in southern and southwestern Sudan. Catastrophic food insecurity is expected to spread to five additional areas before June, according to the ICP monitoring group. “This is a man-made crisis. Man made because it is driven by conflict. And man-made because of the intentional obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance by parties the conflict,” the World Food Programme’s Regional Emergency Coordinator Shaun Hughes said in a briefing Thursday, calling for access and safe passage for humanitarian workers and supplies. “Humanitarian agencies don’t have the influence to negotiate this on our own. It requires the world to pay attention, and coherent and tenacious engagement from the international community, particularly countries that have influence on those waging war,” Hughes added. Nearly two years after the conflict broke out, civilians continue to be targeted, compounding the humanitarian situation. At the epicenter of the malnutrition crisis in Zamzam refugee camp, Sudan’s largest located in North Darfur, displaced civilians have been attacked by RSF fighters. Now, cuts to USAID programs are leaving civilians in an increasingly vulnerable position, said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps’ vice president of global policy and advocacy. Funding cuts to Mercy Corps’ programs alone threaten to leave nearly 200,000 Sudanese civilians hungry or without safe drinking water, a development that Phillips-Barrasso compared to “turning the oxygen off in a hospital.” CNN’s Mounira Elsamra contributed reporting.",,0.3614197075366974
"Two Belgian teenagers were charged Tuesday with wildlife piracy after they were found with thousands of ants packed in test tubes in what Kenyan authorities said was part of a trend in trafficking smaller and lesser known species. Lornoy David and Seppe Lodewijckx, two 19-year-olds who were arrested on April 5 with 5,000 ants at a guest house, appeared distraught during their appearance before a magistrate in Nairobi and were comforted in the courtroom by relatives. They told the magistrate they were collecting the ants for fun and did not know that it was illegal. In a separate criminal case, Kenyan Dennis Ng’ang’a and Vietnamese Duh Hung Nguyen also were charged with illegal trafficking in the same courtroom, following their arrest while in possession of 400 ants. The Kenya Wildlife Service said the four men were involved in trafficking the ants to markets in Europe and Asia, and that the species included messor cephalotes, a distinctive, large and red-colored harvester ant native to East Africa. The illegal export of the ants “not only undermines Kenya’s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits,” KWS said in a statement. Kenya has in the past fought against the trafficking of body parts of larger species of wild animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins among others. But the cases against the four men represent “a shift in trafficking trends — from iconic large mammals to lesser-known yet ecologically critical species,” KWS said. The two Belgians were arrested in Kenya’s Nakuru county, which is home to various national parks. The 5,000 ants were found in a guest house where they were staying, and were packed in 2,244 test tubes that had been filled with cotton wool to enable the ants to survive for months. The other two men were arrested in Nairobi where they were found to have 400 ants in their apartments. Kenyan authorities valued the ants at 1 million shillings ($7,700). The prices for ants can vary greatly according to the species and the market. Philip Muruthi, a vice president for conservation at the Africa Wildlife Foundation in Nairobi, said ants play the role of enriching soils, enabling germination and providing food for species such as birds. “The thing is, when you see a healthy forest, like Ngong forest, you don’t think about what is making it healthy. It is the relationships all the way from the bacteria to the ants to the bigger things,” he said. Muruthi warned of the risk of trafficking species and exporting diseases to the agricultural industry of the destination countries. “Even if there is trade, it should be regulated and nobody should be taking our resources just like that,” he said.",,0.26396477222442627
"Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized control of a major camp for displaced people in North Darfur, the paramilitary group said on Sunday, after a four-day assault the government and aid groups have said left hundreds dead or wounded. The fighting has centered around the Zamzam camp, which, along with the nearby Abu Shouk camp, hosts some 700,000 people displaced by Sudan’s war. The assault has destroyed shelters, markets, and healthcare facilities, aid groups said. The RSF said the camp was being used as a base by what it called “mercenary factions.” But humanitarian groups denounced the assault as a targeted attack on vulnerable civilians, including women, children and elderly people, who are already facing famine. The Sudan Liberation Army (SLA), a Darfur militia allied to the national army, has been fighting the RSF around the city of al-Fashir, around 15 km (9.3 miles) from Zamzam, with the help of other local armed groups. Tens of thousands of camp residents have fled to al-Fashir on foot, overwhelming shelters, and are now sleeping outdoors without food, water, or medicine, SLA spokesperson El-Sadiq Ali El-Nour said on Sunday.

      Sudan accuses UAE of ‘support and complicity’ in genocide at World Court The city - the capital of Sudan’s North Darfur province - came under heavy shelling and RSF ground attacks on Sunday, the SLA said, calling for military support from Sudan’s armed forces and allied factions. The Sudanese army has a base with several thousand troops in al-Fashir. “The leadership of the armed forces must act swiftly to save the lives of approximately 1.5 million people in al-Fashir urgently,” the SLA said in a statement. “Darfur must not fight alone.” The RSF has denied targeting civilians and, on Saturday, accused its rivals of orchestrating a media campaign using actors and staged scenes within the camp to falsely incriminate it. On Sunday, it said it had organized voluntary evacuations for families fleeing al-Fashir and surrounding camps and welcomed humanitarian agencies to respond to the deteriorating conditions. The war in Sudan erupted in April 2023, sparked by a power struggle between the army and the RSF, shattering hopes for a transition to civilian rule. The conflict has since displaced millions and devastated regions like Darfur, where the RSF is now fighting to maintain its stronghold amid army advances in Khartoum.",,0.2522486448287964
"An American preacher who was taken hostage by armed men while preaching a sermon in a South African township last week has been rescued in a fierce gun battle with his kidnappers, police said Wednesday. Josh Sullivan, 45, was kidnapped last Thursday during an evening service in Motherwell, a township in Gqeberha, formerly known as Port Elizabeth, in South Africa’s Eastern Cape province, the Fellowship Baptist Church said. The South African Police Service said officers launched a rescue operation after receiving intelligence the pastor was being held by his abductors at a house in KwaMagxaki, another township in the city. A rescue team was sent to the location, a police statement said, “leading to a high-intensity shootout” that left “three unidentified suspects” dead. “As officers approached the house, they observed a vehicle on the premises. The suspects inside the vehicle upon seeing law enforcement allegedly attempted to flee and opened fire on the team,” the statement read. Related article

Kidnappings are at a record high in South Africa with an average of 51 abductions every day, authorities said last year. The country also grapples with deadly mass shootings and a murder rate that is among the highest in the world. Sullivan’s abduction comes two months after renowned Islamic cleric Muhsin Hendricks was shot dead by armed men in Bethelsdorp, also in the Eastern Cape province.

"“The White Lotus” Season 3 finale is upon us and, of course, there are some wild theories floating around the internet that may come to pass during Sunday’s sure-to-be wild closing episode. Some of those theories border on full-throttle conspiracies, others are just straight-up ridiculous, and the rest just may wind up ringing true. Regardless, all of them are endlessly entertaining, giving viewers something to speculate about before the finale airs. Here’s just some conjecture to dive into as we reluctantly prepare to check out of the White Lotus resort & spa in Thailand on Sunday. Jim Hollinger is Rick’s dad There is a contingent of viewers that have been speculating about a “Star Wars”-inspired twist as it pertains to Jim Hollinger (Scott Glenn) and Rick (Walton Goggins) ever since it became clear that Rick had taken a special interest in Sritala’s (Lek Patravadi) husband. Rick confronted Hollinger at his home during last week’s episode, but what was left out of the scene was any explanation from Hollinger about what actually happened or how they’re linked, at least according to him. As the theory goes, the finale will bring more closure for Rick with Hollinger following him back to the resort to pull a Darth Vader-style “Rick, I am your father” declaration. The monkeys did it Since the very first episode, people online have been speculating that the monkeys often seen in ambient shots of Thailand’s nature are to blame for the ultimate shootout teased in this season’s opening scene. While many have enjoyed the theory, actress Michelle Monaghan, who plays Jaclyn Lemon on the show, debunked it last month during an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” where she declared, “The monkeys did not do it!” It seems that creator Mike White is leaving the gun-slinging to the humans. A poison fruit smoothie is blended up This is another theory that’s been floating around since the first episode, when hotel staffer Pam (Morgana O’Reilly) warned the Ratliffs not to eat the fruit rolling around their hotel villa’s pool deck because it’s poisonous. It’s a topic that has since held strong in conversations about the show online, with each passing episode leaving viewers wondering when those pesky poison fruits may come back into play – especially with Saxon’s (Patrick Schwarzenegger) obsession with making a noisy, daily smoothie. Based on the promo for the finale episode, it looks like Timothy (Jason Isaacs) is holding the toxic fruit in his hand while asking Pam to remind him about its dangers. Is it ominous foreshadowing or a red herring? Either way, careful what you gulp. Kate’s gossip has implications for Tim In one of Victoria’s (Parker Posey) most memorable scenes early on this season, she unapologetically snubs the gossip-monger known as Kate (Leslie Bibb) after she recognized her from a baby shower the pair both attended in Austin. Victoria barely muttered a word to Kate, who approached the Ratliffs during a meal, making the exchange extra awkward. This feels like one of those loose ends that still needs to be tied up, and that there’s a reason for establishing this connection. Perhaps Kate connected with their friend in common while at the resort to tell her that she ran into Victoria in Thailand? Remember, the Ratliffs don’t have their phones so they (seemingly) aren’t aware of the state of Tim’s financial woes, but Kate and Victoria’s mutual friend back home may have heard. Will this come back to bite Tim, knowing his location could be compromised leading to law enforcement getting involved? Or will Kate be the one to tell Victoria about the allegations against her husband? Piper goes home Piper’s (Sarah Catherine Hook) storyline about wanting to stay in Thailand is a callback to Season 1, when Quinn Mossbacher (Fred Hechinger) wound up staying in Maui as the rest of his family made their return trip. It was hard not to think about Quinn after Piper revealed her master monastery plan to stay, but with those shots of bare bones living quarters and seemingly inedible food during her overnight at the meditation center, it begs the question of whether Piper is really ready for the no-frills commitment. Especially after her confusing reaction to Lochlan (Sam Nivola) wanting to stay abroad with her, it seems like Victoria’s prayers may just be answered and Piper will head back home to North Carolina. Fabian is working with authorities Put on your tin foil hat because here’s a doozy. Some have speculated that hotel manager Fabian (Christian Friedel) dismissed Belinda’s concerns about Greg/Gary because the two men are nefariously working together, but this new theory suggests otherwise. “White Lotus” costume designer Alex Bovaird said in a recent interview that she dressed some characters – including Fabian – in costumes designed by Thai brand Jim Thompson. Legend has it that the brand’s namesake was a textile factory owner in Thailand, as well as a CIA spy, and he mysteriously disappeared in 1967. Bovaird teased that this connection holds meaning in Season 3, and some viewers think Fabian is that thread. The theory is that Fabian is working with authorities to take down Greg/Gary, which could offer an alternate explanation as to why Fabian was so quick to dismiss Belinda’s (Natasha Rothwell) very legitimate concerns about him. The hotel manager/spy probably has it handled, ok? It’s Chelsea in the water We’re just as stressed about this theory as you are, but it has to be said: earlier this season, Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) got bit by a venomous snake and was a victim of the hotel boutique robbery. She brushed death twice and even said it herself, “Bad things come in threes.” Let’s just hope that third bad thing isn’t Chelsea floating in the water near Zion(!). “The White Lotus” Season 3 finale episode will air on Sunday on HBO and stream on Max.

"The dramatic arrest of the Philippines’ controversial former president in March sent shock waves through much of the world – and cast a renewed spotlight on the other leaders wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who was whisked off to the Netherlands to answer for alleged crimes against humanity, had long been under scrutiny over a brutal anti-drugs crackdown. But even after years of on-and-off investigations, during which Duterte taunted the court and told it to “hurry up,” his detention came as a surprise to many experts. “We have had other high-ranking individuals brought before the court,” including several former presidents of African nations, said Leila Sadat, professor of international criminal law at the Washington University School of Law and the former special adviser on crimes against humanity to the ICC prosecutor. But in many of those cases, the prosecuted leaders were either summoned to court or arrested after a warrant was publicly issued – a stark contrast to Duterte’s case, where the warrant was issued secretly and the former leader swiftly apprehended within several head-spinning hours. “It’s the first time we’ve seen this at the ICC,” Sadat said – though similar cases have been seen in other international tribunals, she added. Duterte, now 80, oversaw a ferocious crackdown on alleged drug pushers in the Philippines that killed more than 6,000 people, based on police data. Independent monitors believe the number of extrajudicial killings could be much higher. His arrest is significant, partly because it could set a precedent for future trials of other leaders wanted by the court, however unlikely, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That’s not to say their turn could be imminent, far from it – many political factors can make it extremely difficult to execute an arrest warrant. Case in point: Netanyahu on Sunday was wrapping up a visit to Hungary, in defiance of the ICC warrant. As a signatory to the Rome Statute, Hungary is obligated to arrest anyone wanted by the ICC. Instead, its Prime Minister Viktor Orban welcomed Netanyahu with open arms, and Budapest announced it would begin the process of leaving the court. After Hungary, the Israeli prime minister will fly to the United States to meet President Donald Trump, both sides have told CNN. They will discuss, among other agenda items, “the fight at the International Criminal Court,” Netanyahu’s office said. But Duterte’s case has shown that arrest is possible – especially once a leader is out of office – and that the threat against those wanted leaders is not only theoretical. “The precedent set here – maybe not now, but in future generations – will allow us to visualize what justice looks like for the highest-ranking leaders of countries that commit these kinds of crimes,” said Gregory Gordon, a professor of international criminal law at the Peking University School of Transnational Law in Shenzhen, China. “There’s always that initial breakthrough that has to happen.” Putin and the Ukraine war Located in The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC investigates and prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression against the territory of its member states, of which there are 125. The court cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants – which often rests on domestic politics and political will. ICC member countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil and all other members of the European Union – at least until Hungary makes its promised exit. In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russian official Maria Lvova-Belova over an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. The charges were the first to be formally lodged by the ICC against Russian officials since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. Related article
      Putin’s world just got a lot smaller with the ICC’s arrest warrant Russia – like the United States, Israel, China and Ukraine – is not a member of the ICC. The court does not have its own police force and does not conduct trials in absentia – and therefore the likelihood of any Russian official appearing before it is very low, analysts said. Any charged Russian officials would either have to be handed over by Moscow, or arrested outside of Russia, said Sadat, the Washington University professor. “The warrant against Vladimir Putin himself is obviously the most challenging because he’s a head of state in power, and he’s not going to leave Russia unless he’s pretty sure he’s going to have immunity wherever he goes,” she said. “But his choices are now restricted, and he’s been labeled, for better or worse, a war criminal.” Gordon agreed, saying the chances of Putin being arrested are slim, given his “firm grip on power” and layers of protection – unless Russia’s domestic political situation changes enough to leave him vulnerable. After all, it was a dramatic change in the Philippines’ domestic politics that ultimately did for Duterte. Even when Putin leaves Russia, many countries are unwilling to arrest him. Last year, the Russian leader traveled to Mongolia without facing any repercussions – despite the East Asian country being a member of the ICC. “Obviously the pressure on a small country like Mongolia is pretty substantial,” Sadat said. But she pointed to other times the warrant had seemed to restrict Putin’s movements; in 2023, the Russian leader attended a BRICS summit in ICC signatory South Africa via video call, sparing the host country a potential diplomatic quandary. “I think the warrants themselves are powerful. At the same time, we do have to see a significant number of warrants actually get executed, or the warrants become sort of symbols of a court that can’t arrest its accused,” she said. “That’s why (Duterte’s arrest) is a really exciting moment for the court, because it shows it can engage in interstate cooperation.” Netanyahu, Hamas and the Gaza war The ICC issued its warrant for Netanyahu in November 2024 – also seeking the arrest of former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant – citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. A senior Hamas official is also wanted by the ICC on allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel. Other leaders of the militant group sought by the court for prosecution were killed by Israel. The historic warrants made Netanyahu the first Israeli leader summoned by an international court for alleged actions against Palestinians in the more than seven-decade-long Arab-Israeli conflict. The warrants were also denounced across the Israeli political spectrum as unconscionable, with Netanyahu’s own office labeling the move “antisemitic.” Several Israeli allies – including the United States – strongly criticized the ICC warrant. Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction, nor does it honor international warrants issued by the court, and likely wouldn’t turn over Israeli citizens for prosecution. In addition, the ICC only steps in when a country’s own government is unwilling or unable to prosecute cases. Related article
      What is the ICC and why has Trump sanctioned it? But unlike Russia, it is a functioning democracy, with a long history of peaceful transitions between elected governments. That makes Netanyahu’s future political security more tenuous than Putin’s, and more comparable to the Duterte situation, where a shift in government once the Philippine leader was out of office ultimately led to his downfall. The Israeli prime minister is already contending with a number of domestic legal troubles unrelated to the Gaza war, including a long-running corruption trial. Israel is also deeply politically divided, with many citizens furious at the Netanyahu government and his far-right cabinet allies. According to Gordon, it is at least “conceivable” that Netanyahu could one day face arrest in Israel for alleged crimes related to Israel’s actions in Gaza – though that still doesn’t mean the ICC warrant would be enforced. Then there’s the fact that several powerful nations have opted not to enforce the ICC’s warrants while others have openly rejected them – further undermining the court’s authority. France, for instance, had fervently supported the ICC’s warrant for Putin – but it shifted its stance after the court sought Netanyahu’s arrest, arguing that as Israel was not an ICC member, its prime minister should be immune from prosecution. Other European nations have also indicated they would be unwilling to enforce the Israeli warrants. But critics say the responses suggest two sets of rules: one for the West’s traditional allies, and another for its foes. “States can’t claim success in international criminal justice if they don’t commit to upholding everyone’s rights involved,” James Joseph, managing editor at non-profit legal news outlet Jurist News, told CNN in December. The trouble with international prosecutions The ICC has a long list of outstanding arrest warrants, including for former dictator Omar al-Bashir, who ruled Sudan for three decades before being deposed in 2019. Currently imprisoned in Sudan, Bashir faces charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. A disproportionate number of ICC prosecutions have been against African leaders, warlords and militia members – including former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the East African country’s current leader William Ruto, whose case was abandoned by the court partly due to “witness interference and political meddling.” The ICC’s past focus on Africa is partly rooted in its constitution, said Sadat in Washington. The court can only exercise jurisdiction in crimes committed on or after its creation on July 1, 2002. At the time, major wars that killed millions were raging across Africa, from Darfur to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Additionally, many African nations self-referred their cases to the ICC, Sadat added – meaning they asked the international court to investigate and granted it jurisdiction. Related article
      Netanyahu arrest warrant tests Western commitment to international law “With time, the prosecutor’s office started staffing up, developing more expertise, taking on additional situations … now the court is moving into other situations,” Sadat said. But, she added, it’s difficult to prosecute alleged crimes while conflicts are ongoing and those accused remain in positions of power. For years, the ICC has faced criticism for slow trials and its low conviction rate. From 60 arrest warrants issued since the court was created, 31 suspects remain at large. Only 11 defendants have ever been convicted – all African war criminals. Sadat pointed to Syria, saying that for years, the ICC couldn’t “figure out a way to get jurisdiction” to investigate alleged war crimes during the country’s civil war – until former dictator Bashar al-Assad’s regime was toppled in December. Since then, the new interim government has invited the court to visit the country and collect the evidence needed for prosecution. The Philippines is another prime example of how ICC cases often become stuck until some political upheaval changes the game, said Gordon, the law professor. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had previously said the Southeast Asian country would not engage with the ICC, only for Manila to reverse its stance this week following the collapse of an alliance between the Marcos political dynasty and Duterte’s clan. Some might argue “that this is just about politics, and that the only time the ICC will ever be able to engage in the justice process is if political processes are aligned in certain ways – and it’s just a matter of luck, not justice,” Gordon said. But others – including both experts who spoke to CNN – were more optimistic. Duterte’s arrest could establish a foundation for “combating the culture of impunity and assuring accountability for state leaders who commit international crimes,” Gordon said. “That makes people in the future more comfortable with the idea that it can be done.”",,0.2794082760810852
"“Why is everyone carrying those guns?” This seemingly valid question was asked during an episode of season three of “The White Lotus” by Kate (Leslie Bibb), one of three women in Thailand on a girls’ trip together — but who don’t appear to actually like each other. The trio, on an excursion to a town near their resort, are alarmed to see the heavily armed but colorfully dressed crowd. “On Songkran they have water fights in the street,” says resort employee Valentin (Arnas Fedaravicius) as he drops them off, telling them to do some shopping. “It’s for fun, don’t worry about it.” The ladies carry on, walking down the crowded street, pleading with a group of young kids that starts shooting water at them to leave them alone as they are “going out tonight” and “don’t want to get wet.” Related article
      ‘White Lotus’ is expected to lure more tourists to Thailand. These are the locations featured on season 3 of the hit show As any seasoned Songkran vet knows, such pleas often make things worse. The screaming women attempt to run from the chaos, the kids in hot pursuit, before ducking into a convenience store where Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) exclaims: “What the *&@#! was that?!” On the surface, Thailand’s annual Songkran festival does indeed appear to be just one great big water fight. Every April, people young and old take to the streets all over the country, armed with plastic guns and water buckets, and engage in hours-long battles from morning till dusk. And while that’s certainly the most famous aspect of the celebrations, Songkran is filled with unique cultural traditions, making it an excellent time for travelers to visit. What exactly is Songkran? The word “Songkran” is said to have derived from ancient Sanskrit, used to describe the monthly movement within the zodiac. It marks the start of the traditional Thai New Year and is usually celebrated from April 13-15, though some places stretch out the fun a few extra days. Taking place at the height of the Thai summer, it’s a time to take a break from work and hit the road, with many people journeying hundreds of kilometers to their hometowns to reconnect with family and friends. In 2023, UNESCO added Songkran to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, noting that it refers to the sun’s annual passing into the Aries constellation, the first sign of the Zodiac, which marks the traditional start of the traditional Thai New Year festival. “Pouring water is a significant act during Songkran, symbolizing cleansing, reverence and good fortune,” reads the UNESCO inscription. “Other activities include bathing important Buddha images, splashing water on family and friends, folk plays, games, music and feasting.” It’s the splashing that has turned Songkran into a global sensation in recent decades, with massive water fights held on closed city streets everywhere from Khao San Road and Silom Road in Bangkok to Chiang Mai’s historic Old City. In a 2024 interview with CNN, Pipad Krajaejun, a history lecturer at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, said it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the water fights became such a key part of the festival. “However, old photos shot by Boonserm Satraphai of Chiang Mai in 1964 show that numerous people engaged in water battles in the Ping River,” he added. “According to many elderly people, water fights have been taking place in various places in Thailand for 60-70 years.” In those days, Pipad said, “everyone played with water in the village, everyone knew each other, and there was kinship,” unlike today’s battles, which can involve thousands of revelers and high-powered water guns. Songkran celebrations take place all over the country in pretty much every city, town and village. (We’ll share more on the water fights below.) Some events are organized by local government bodies, while many hospitality businesses including theme parks, hotels, restaurants and bars host their own Songkran-themed parties. Some towns limit the water fights to one day, so be sure to check ahead if you’re planning to join the battles. Thailand’s Tourism Authority has put together a list of official celebrations taking place all over the country as part of the Maha Songkran World Water Festival 2025, including the multiple events planned for Bangkok. Tradition with a touch of modernity Though Songkran traditions vary all over the country, Thammasat University’s Pipad says two main rituals are still widely carried out today. On the first day of the new year, on April 13, “people, particularly the elderly, visit temples to sprinkle water on Buddha images” – a ritual that’s known as Song Nam Phra. “However, each region of Thailand has a slightly different practice; for example, in northern Thailand — or Lanna — people utilize a naga waterspout to pour water on a Buddha image rather than directly,” he says. “The second tradition (called Rot Nam Dam Hua) is to pour water with perfume and flowers on the hands of the family’s older members, then the elderly will bless their lineage.” This traditionally happens on April 14. Nowadays, visitors will see Buddha statues placed in businesses too, even in places like shopping malls, accompanied by small silver-hued cups floating in pools of scented water. Safely enjoying the water fights With water fights taking place in outdoor spaces all over the country, visitors won’t have any issues joining in. Water guns are available for sale everywhere during Songkran, with street vendors often setting up near popular water fight areas. But there are some important things to consider before heading out. In terms of safety issues, the number of fatal road accidents is notoriously high during the holiday period, with drunk driving a key factor, while complaints of sexual harassment have been  reported as well. Officials advise visitors in need of emergency assistance to call the tourist hotline at 1155. Those heading out should put their valuables in a waterproof pouch — even waterproof phones. Getting wet, white powder smeared on your face is often part of the experience and can result in a gooey mess. To avoid eye irritation — water cleanliness can be questionable — consider wearing goggles or large, transparent glasses. The usual common sense applies when out in the heat. Stay hydrated, wear a hat and put on sunscreen. It’s summer in Thailand, with temperatures creeping up to 40 Celsius (104 F) and beyond this time of year. On the flip side, heading into an air-conditioned vehicle or building while dripping wet can be a real shock to the senses. A towel and a change of clothes in a dry bag come in handy when the splashing is over. Got an old Hawaiian shirt you’ve been looking for an excuse to wear? Now’s your chance. Songkran revelers often dress up in bright, colorful, flower-covered shirts. Thailand’s seasonal culinary delights Food is a huge part of the Songkran equation. This is a diverse country filled with many regional cuisines, meaning every province will have its own culinary traditions. But there are a few dishes that are particularly special in the summer months. Among these is a delicacy called “khao chae,” which translates to “rice soaked in water.” A refreshing meal served during the summer months, usually from late March to May, it appears on many seasonal menus, with high-end hotels often serving their own rendition of the classic. For instance, the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok’s classic khao chae set includes jasmine-infused water with ice and an assortment of side dishes, such as kapi balls, deep-fried shallots and fish, stuffed peppers, shredded pork and fresh vegetables. And of course we can’t forget the ubiquitous mango sticky rice, a tourist favorite found everywhere from the streets to high-end Thai restaurants. In this special dish, eaten as a snack or dessert, sweet sticky rice is drizzled in a coconut cream sauce and served with ripe mango. Though available all year, it’s particularly popular in the summer months when mangoes are in season. If you don’t mind battling the crowds, K. Panich is a Bangkok institution that has been serving up mango sticky rice for close to 100 years. CNN Travel’s Karla Cripps has lived in Thailand for more than 20 years.

"Thailand’s arrest of a prominent American academic on charges of insulting the monarchy has “alarmed” the United States, the State Department said, in a rare case of a foreign national allegedly falling foul of the kingdom’s strict lese majeste law. Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan University in central Thailand who writes analysis on the kingdom’s military and politics, could face years in prison after he was formally charged and detained when he presented himself to police and appeared in court on Tuesday. Thailand has some of the world’s strictest lese majeste laws, and criticizing the king, queen, or heir apparent can lead to a maximum 15-year prison sentence for each offense. Anyone can file a lese majeste complaint and sentences for those convicted can be decades long, with hundreds of people prosecuted in recent years. Chambers’ lawyer, Wannaphat Jenroumjit, said a warrant for his arrest was issued last week after a complaint was filed by a regional army command. Alongside lese majeste, Chambers is also facing charges under the Computer Crimes Act. “He was accused of publishing a blurb on (Singapore’s Institute of Southeast Asian Studies’) website in connection with an ISEAS webinar in October 2024 about military reshuffles,” said Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate, advocacy lead for Thai Lawyers for Human Rights and part of Chambers’ legal team. “He denied all charges. He neither wrote nor published the blurb on the website,” Akarachai said. Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s court appearance, Chambers told CNN he had been told little about why he was charged and feared he “could be imprisoned for 15 years.” Chambers was released on bail early Thursday after multiple bail requests were earlier denied. He is barred from leaving the country and Thai authorities have revoked his work visa. Chambers is a scholar, author and lecturer at Naresuan University’s Centre of ASEAN Community Studies, and frequently contributes insights to news articles on Southeast Asia, including to CNN.

      Thailand indicts former leader Thaksin Shinawatra on royal insult charges Advocates say the charges pose “a grave threat to academic freedom in the country.” “Unlike other lese majeste cases, this case involves an extremely well-established academic whose work focuses very deeply on the civil-military relations in Thailand and whose expertise is widely acknowledged within the academic community,” Akarachai said. The US Department of State said on Tuesday it was “alarmed” by Chambers’ arrest and is providing consular assistance. “We are in communication with Thai authorities regarding this case,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a statement. “As a treaty ally of Thailand, we will closely monitor this issue and advocate for the fair treatment of Paul Chambers… We have requested access to him to ensure his well-being and to provide any necessary support.” Thailand’s conservative, military-backed establishment has ruled the country on and off for decades, and critics say it routinely uses laws like lese majeste, sedition, and the computer crimes act to silence criticism and opposition. The military has long had an outsized influence over the country’s politics, despite Thais repeatedly voting overwhelmingly in support of the military’s political and progressive opponents. It has staged 13 successful coups since absolute monarchy ended in 1932, the latest in 2014 that ushered in just under a decade of military or military-backed rule. Longest sentence: 50 years Last year, a Thai appeal court extended a man’s prison sentence to a record 50 years for insulting the monarchy, in what is believed to be the toughest penalty ever imposed under the lese majeste law. The charges against Chambers represent a “tightening chokehold on free speech and academic freedom in Thailand,” said Sunai Phasuk, senior Thailand researcher for Human Rights Watch. “Paul is considered a major target by ultra-royalist groups, which have launched multiple attacks against him for years — ranging from online disinformation and hate campaigns to pressing authorities to revoke his visa and get him expulsed from the university,” Sunai told CNN. It is rare for a foreign national to be targeted by lese majeste. In 2011, Thai-born American Joe W. Gordon was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison for insulting the monarchy after posting a link to a biography of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, that he was involved in translating, which was banned in Thailand. He was later released after receiving a royal pardon. Related article
      Young Thai activist’s death in detention after 65-day hunger strike sparks calls for justice reform For years, human rights organizations and free speech campaigners have said the law has been used as a political tool to silence critics of the Thai government. And rights groups say the right to freedom of expression in Thailand has come under increased attack since 2020, when nationwide youth-led protests saw millions of young people take to the streets calling for constitutional and democratic reforms – for the first time openly criticizing the monarchy, and publicly questioning its power and wealth. Those protests came four years after King Maha Vajiralongkorn succeeded his father King Bhumibol, who had reigned for seven decades. Despite the change from a military-backed government to civilian leadership in 2023, surveillance and intimidation against activists and students continues, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. The legal advocacy group said that since the start of those protests in July 2020 and up until the end of January 2025, at least 1,960 people have been prosecuted or charged for their participation in political assemblies and for speaking out, with at least 277 prosecuted for lese majeste. One of the most prominent of those is Arnon Nampa, a Thai activist with a cumulative sentence of 18 years in prison for a raft of lese majeste and other charges relating to his advocating for monarchy reform during the 2020 protests. A much-anticipated bill that would offer amnesty for those prosecuted in politically motivated cases will be introduced to Thailand’s parliament on Wednesday.  However, there is ongoing debate as to whether lese majeste will be included in the bill. The high-profile nature of Chambers’ case could mean it backfires on the military and have wider impacts on Thai society, some analysts say. “The cost to the Thai military is high because it will attract the kind of international attention and scrutiny the army wants to avoid,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University. “This case tightens the lid on academic freedom, and will reinforce the closing of Thai minds and undermine the intellectual and research ecosystem necessary to foster ideas and innovation to propel the Thai economy forward.” CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.",,0.2509315609931946
"Editor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay. In recent years, no TV series has gotten viewers excited about luxury travel quite like “The White Lotus.” It’s easy to understand why. It’s got murder. Sexy scandals. Gorgeous beaches. And, perhaps most importantly, wealthy travelers behaving terribly. Seasons one and two of the satirical dark comedy-drama, written and directed by Mike White, were set in luxury hotels in two stunning places — Hawaii and Sicily, respectively. In both seasons, guests and employees experience a transformative week as the truths behind the characters’ seemingly idyllic lives are exposed. The third season of the Emmy-winning HBO show, now streaming on Max, takes viewers to another one of the world’s most popular destinations — Thailand. The cast includes Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan, Jason Isaacs, Leslie Bibb, Walton Goggins, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger and Thailand’s very own K-pop superstar, Lalisa ‘Lisa’ Manobal. Season one fan favorite Natasha Rothwell also returns to reprise her role as spa employee Belinda. Related article
      Arnold Schwarzenegger awkwardly weighs in on son Patrick’s ‘White Lotus’ nude scene But the stunning landscapes of Koh Samui, where most of the action takes place, and other popular destinations like Bangkok and Phuket also play starring roles. Thankfully, HBO has released a list highlighting many of the locations that were used to create the irresistible backdrop of season three, allowing travelers to create their own White Lotus-inspired journey. As Lalisa’s character “Mook” says, “I hope you enjoy Thailand.” Minor spoilers ahead! Koh Samui shoot locations Koh Samui, located in the Gulf of Thailand, is the country’s second-biggest island after Phuket. Its white sandy shores are dotted with luxury hotels, a handful of which make an appearance in the show. Keeping with tradition, the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui is the real star of season three, standing in for the title character — the White Lotus Resort & Spa. (Both seasons one and two were filmed in Four Seasons properties.) Many scenes take place in the resort’s luxurious pool villas, as well as at the main swimming pool, common areas, paths and fitness areas. And that includes the gorgeous Ratliff family villa, where matriarch Victoria (Parker Posey) recites some of her most iconic lines. (No word on whether the villa comes with its own blender or if it needs to be requested.) All of the breakfast and lunch restaurant scenes were shot in the Four Seasons resort as well.

      The ultimate Koh Samui day trip: Thailand’s Ang Thong National Marine Park The “White Lotus” bar, however, can actually be found at another luxury property — it’s Anantara Lawana Koh Samui Resort’s Singing Bird Lounge. (The dinner restaurant is actually in Phuket, more on that below.) As for the hotel’s security station and driveway, where many scenes featuring security guard Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) took place? You’ll have to head for the Thai hotel brand’s second resort on the island, Anantara Bophut Koh Samui. The jewelry store scenes were shot there too. And of course we can’t forget the Buddhist monastery that brought the Ratliff family to Koh Samui in the first place. Those scenes were shot at Wat Phu Khao Thong, near Maenam Beach. Meanwhile, in a humorous scene in episode four, the three ladies traveling together get to experience their first Songkran festival. Those scenes were shot at the Fisherman’s Village. Two locations were actually used to create Greg/Gary’s luxurious villa — Samujana Villa 12 on Koh Samui and Villa Amaravida over on the island of Phuket. Other Samui resorts and attractions featured in the new season include Choeng Mon Beach, Am Samui Resort Taling Ngam, the Dusit Dheva Cultural Center, Cape Fahn Hotel the Pi Samui Beach Club and Restaurant, the Magical Weed Garden Lounge and the Samui Snake Farm, where Rick (Walton Goggins) sets free about a dozen snakes — one of which bites Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood). The nearby island of Koh Phangan’s Haad Rin Beach also makes an appearance on the show, with several characters heading to the island to experience the famous monthly Full Moon Party. Meanwhile, some arrival scenes were filmed at the stunning Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park — a popular day trip for Samui visitors. Scenes filmed in Phuket As noted, some scenes for “The White Lotus” were shot on Thailand’s largest island, Phuket, in the Andaman Sea. If that beautiful spa pavilion, set in a lagoon where some of the pivotal opening and concluding events of the season took place, has you excited, you’ll want to head for the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort. This resort is also home to that gorgeous private pool villa employee Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) stayed in. Villa 42, to be exact. “White Lotus” dinner scenes were filmed at yet another luxury hotel property — Rosewood Phuket’s Ta Khai restaurant. Other Phuket attractions highlighted by HBO that appear on the show include Bangla Boxing, Ya Nui Beach, the Phuket Yacht Haven Marina and Café Del Mar. Additional arrival scenes were filmed at Ko Lawa Yai, which is off the coast of Phuket near Phang Nga Bay, says HBO. Rick’s trip to Bangkok In the second half of the series, Rick leaves Chelsea behind and embarks on a side trip to Bangkok, where he meets up with old friend Frank, played by Sam Rockwell. During one of the most talked about TV monologues of the year, Frank makes some wild confessions about how he’s been spending his time in Thailand. That scene was shot inside the Bamboo Bar inside Bangkok’s historic Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The pair eventually heads to confront American expat Jim Hollinger (Scott Glenn), whom Rick believes wronged his family, at the grand riverside home he shares with his wife, White Lotus owner Sritala. Travelers can actually stay in that property too — it’s the Siri Sala Private Thai Villa, located on the Bangkok Noi Canal. Guests need to book the entire home, which has six bedrooms. Next, Rick and Frank hit the town. Those night club scenes were shot inside Bangkok’s Sing Sing Theater on Sukhumvit Road. The pair then make their way back to the Mandarin Oriental and head through the iconic lobby to head up to the real-life 376-square-meter, two-bedroom Oriental Suite where they keep the party going. The White Lotus effect Ever since it was confirmed in early 2024 that the third season would be set in Thailand, much has been said about the inevitable impact the show will have on tourism growth. “We are honored to have amazing Thailand featured as the filming location for the highly anticipated upcoming season of ‘The White Lotus,’” said Tourism Authority of Thailand Governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool in a press release following the announcement. “The kingdom’s exotic natural beauty, rich historical sites and diverse landscapes are the perfect settings to share our fascinating culture, fantastic cuisine, top-notch wellness and luxury offerings, and most importantly our people and Thai hospitality.” Related article

"Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol moved back on Friday with his wife and their 11 dogs and cats to their apartment in an upscale district of Seoul, close to the prosecutors’ office where the impeached leader worked before entering politics. Yoon and his wife Kim Keon Hee, known for their love of pets, are beginning a new life after he was impeached for a failed attempt to impose martial law and removed from office. Related article
      CNN Exclusive: This Asian leader is taking a very different approach from China over Trump’s tariff war Under Yoon, South Korea passed a bill to ban the eating and selling of dog meat in the country. The number of pets they own grew from four dogs and three cats at the start of his presidency, and now include a retriever that is a retired service dog adopted by Yoon in 2022. The couple’s 164 sq meter apartment is located in a complex in the glitzy “Gangnam” area south of the Han river, and some neighbors have raised concerns about the return of a man who so polarized the nation during his stint in office. As many as 50 presidential security service personnel will be deployed to guard the couple, who are entitled to protection for at least five years, according to South Korean media reports. The three 37-story towers that make up the Acrovista complex are home to more than 750 households. Previously, South Korean presidents have moved into detached houses after leaving office, which have afforded much greater privacy. The security arrangement in the crowded residential property where they will now live is believed to have been one of the reasons that delayed their move back to the private home by a week after he was stripped of the presidency.

"The beauty stores in Manhattan’s Koreatown are packed, even on a rainy Tuesday afternoon. But this time, an associate that spoke to CNN in one of the stores had some warnings: One popular sunscreen had changed its formula since it’s now manufactured in the United States. Another has been sold out for weeks. If 25% tariffs on South Korea go through, more changes could be on the way. South Korean acting President Han Duck-soo previously told CNN his country would not fight back against the tariffs, instead hoping to negotiate with the US. Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs toward the country on Wednesday, however, but did not indicate he was pausing the 10% universal tariff on all trading partners. Just a decade ago, Korean beauty products were rarely seen on American store shelves. Now the United States imports $1.7 billion worth of cosmetics products from South Korea, according to 2024 data from the US International Trade Commission, even more in value than beauty powerhouse France. Korea’s giant beauty conglomerates have millions of customers around the world — one of the biggest, Amore Pacific, recorded $2.87 billion in sales in 2024, and its Americas sales surpassed those in China for the first time in the company’s history.

      Here’s what could soon cost you a lot more because of Trump’s massive tariffs Along with K-dramas and K-pop groups, American consumers just can’t get enough of affordable, ultra-filtered Korean sunscreens, glass-skin face serums and 10-step skincare routines. But these products, especially sunscreens, have modern UVA and UVB filters that the US Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved yet so they aren’t present in US-manufactured items. This means Korean skincare’s biggest fans have no alternatives stateside. And at a time where Trump’s tariff agenda could raise prices and change product formulas, they are freaking out. “I’m unwell,” one TikTok user commented under a video this week. “If I have to use American skincare products my face will age horrifically in the recession.” (The United States is not formally in a recession.) While US skin products can feel goopy and leave a white cast, Korean alternatives blend seamlessly and are a fraction of the cost of other imported high-end products. This is in part because troves of Korean beauty products enter the United States without any tariffs added on, thanks to the Korea Free Trade Agreement from 2012. Along with the affordability, a “Korean wave” in the US has “helped expand the (skincare) market globally,” Andrew Yeo, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies, told CNN. K-beauty may not be Korea’s biggest export, especially compared to automobiles and semiconductors, but the industry allows the country to profit from its cultural impact in the US, he added. Young Americans are often familiar with Korean brands and become loyal customers, he said. But if a college or high school student sees prices go up, they may reconsider buying those products. Prices to rise, formulas to change Christina Im, who owns US-based Korean skincare seller Olive Kollection, stocked up on about $40,000 worth of products from her distributors last weekend after Trump announced the tariffs. During what would be a more typical week, her company spends about $5,000 to $10,000 on those products. “As a small business, we don’t have that much cash on hand to buy everything in large bulk,” Im said. “We just bought as much as we could for now and have to wait and see.” Im is hoping to absorb some of the costs and not raise prices significantly, but she knows customers are pulling back on spending. Right now, her warehouse is filled to the brim with samples that she’s stocked up on. “If business is going to be slow, I’m just going to try to hold out as long as we can,” she said. She estimated that her business would absorb some of the costs, so price increases would be around 10% instead of the full tariff amount. Korean American skincare brand KraveBeauty said in a TikTok that in its seven years of operating, its prices have always been below $28. But that could change starting with its incoming shipment from South Korea. “It’s not something that’s coming out of greed. It’s actually inevitable at this point,” Liah Yoo, the founder of KraveBeauty, said on TikTok. “I don’t think KraveBeauty is going to be an exception in this case.” Even dedicated beauty fans who order from distributor sites like Yesstyle and Stylevana can expect to be hit by price hikes. Yesstyle and Stylevana, for example, mainly ship from their warehouses in Hong Kong. And Trump eliminated the de minimis provision — which allows packages worth less than $800 to enter the country duty-free — starting May 2 for goods from China and Hong Kong. A global shakeup Because their products aren’t FDA-approved yet, some Korean brands have already discontinued selling sunscreens in the US or even moved their manufacturing inside the US. Kolmar — a skincare manufacturer for a variety of different brands — for example, has a lab in New Jersey and a facility in Pennsylvania, created in 2023, long before any talks of tariffs under the second Trump administration. But opening up more facilities within the United States could affect sales another way. Products will have to comply with US regulations and could leave out the key ingredients that attracted consumers in the first place. “If it’s not made the same way and it doesn’t have the same effect, then people are not going buy these products,” Yeo said. And moving manufacturing is a major investment for an economic policy that could only be in place for a few months or years, Yeo said. Korea may have to diversify its trading partners instead, Park Sang-in, a professor of economics at Seoul National University, previously told CNN. But for Americans who have gotten used to having dewy, bouncy skin, it’s hard to go back. Munseob Lee, an assistant professor of economics at University of California San Diego, told CNN that he expects US customers will swallow the cost of the tariffs because there isn’t an alternative. Many users on social media are already showing off their Yesstyle orders or frantically rummaging through their skincare cabinets to see what they need to restock on. As one TikTok user declared: “Might as well just buy a plane ticket to Korea.” CNN’s Yoonjung Seo and Lex Harvey contributed to this report.",,0.2919794023036957
"“Women and dried pollock need to be beaten every three days for better taste” – so goes an old saying that was common in South Korea in the 1960s when Choi Mal-ja was growing up in a small city in the country’s southeast. Back then, male violence against women was widely accepted. So when Choi bit off part of the tongue of a man who allegedly tried to rape her, it was she who was labeled the aggressor and jailed for grievous bodily harm. At the time, Choi was 18 and living at home with her family. Now 78, she’s trying to clear her name in the hope that vindication will pave the way for other victims of sexual crime in South Korea, one of the world’s most advanced economies but one where society remains deeply patriarchal. After Choi’s push for a retrial was rejected by courts in the city of Busan, she took her case to the Supreme Court. The top court ruled in her favor, sending the case back to Busan, where evidence will be called in coming months. Experts say the verdict could rewrite the legal precedent set by her original trial, with far-reaching consequences for other women. “The court must admit the fact that its unfair ruling has turned one person’s life upside down, and take responsibility with just judgement now,” Choi wrote. ‘Like I’d been hit with a hammer’ One spring evening in 1964, Choi, then a teenager, stopped to help a man who was asking for directions in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang province. After walking with him for a few meters, Choi gave him further directions and turned around to go back home, but he tackled her to the ground. “I was feeling woozy, like I’d been hit on the head with a hammer,” Choi told a local TV show in 2020.

      How feminism became a hot topic in South Korea’s presidential election Choi lost consciousness for a short while, but she remembers the man climbing on top of her and trying to force his tongue inside her mouth. She was only able to escape by biting 1.5cm (0.6 inch) of his tongue off, she said. More than two weeks later, the man, who is not named in court documents, and his friends forced their way into Choi’s house and threatened to kill her father for what Choi had done. Ignoring her claims of sexual assault, the man sued Choi for grievous bodily harm, leading her to sue him for attempted rape, trespassing and intimidation. The police deemed Choi’s argument of self-defense reasonable; however, prosecutors in Busan thought otherwise. They dropped the attempted rape charge against her assailant and accused Choi of grievous bodily harm, according to court documents. In 1965, Choi was sentenced to 10 months in prison and two years of probation, a harsher punishment than that of the aggressor, who was sentenced to six months of prison and one year of probation for trespassing and threatening. “It didn’t take a long time for the victim of a sexual crime to be turned into a perpetrator, nor did it take the strength of many people,” Choi wrote in a letter to the Supreme Court last year, as part of her application for a retrial. Choi also claimed that her rights were infringed upon during the investigation and trial process, during which she and her supporters say she was handcuffed at one point and later made to undergo a test to prove her virginity, the result of which was made public. No word for domestic violence Until recent times, the social norm in South Korea was for women to support the men in their family. For example, when the country was developing rapidly after the 1950-53 Korean War, daughters were commonly sent to work at factories to financially support their brothers’ education. “Women’s role was perceived as bricks that lay foundation in society (for men), rather than a subject of love, so society at the time didn’t think of women’s rights when it came to sexual violence,” Chung Chin-sung, an emeritus professor of the sociology department at Seoul National University, told CNN. And until the 1980s, South Korea was so focused on rebuilding from the devastation of the war and Japan’s brutal occupation before that, that fighting for women’s rights was considered “a luxury,” according to Chung. In 1983 the Korea Women’s Hot-Line counseling center opened to campaign against “all institutions, customs and conventions that impose inhumane lives on women,” and establish a “just and peaceful family and society,” according to its statement. At the time, there was no word for domestic violence. “Physically abusing and sexually assaulting women was so common that there weren’t even words to define such actions,” Kim Su-jeong, a director of the center, told CNN. “This is the 1980s. So, imagine what Choi Mal-ja had to go through for her case, in the 1960s,” said Kim. According to Choi’s testimonies, prosecutors and judges asked her during the investigation and trial whether she would like to marry the aggressor to conclude the case. Becoming his wife, so the theory went, might make amends for his injuries, as no other woman would want to marry a man with half a tongue. Wang Mi-yang, the president of the Korea Women Lawyers Association, said the 1965 ruling reflected the “social prejudice and distorted views on victims of sexual violence that remained deeply rooted in our society.” “The social atmosphere of the time probably had the prosecutors siding with the man, and I believe the concept of sexual violence likely didn’t exist,” Wang told CNN. Ending decades of silence Anti-sexual violence movements flourished in the 1990s and even included campaigns seeking justice for “comfort women,” a euphemism for the victims of sexual slavery enforced by the Japanese military in Korea during and before World War II. For many years, “comfort women” kept their trauma secret to avoid shame and humiliation, but they finally spoke out, becoming what Chung calls South Korea’s “first MeToo movement.” Related article
      South Korea’s young men are fighting against feminism “These people lived 70 years, unable to talk about what they’ve experienced, because they would get blamed… but them revealing themselves to the world means society has changed that much,” Chung said. The global #MeToo movement properly took hold in South Korea in 2018, holding powerful men to account and pushing the government to enforce harsher punishments for crimes of sexual violence. Changing attitudes motivated Choi Mal-ja to seek a retrial. “The girl’s life, which couldn’t even blossom, was forever unfair and in resentment… the country must compensate for my human rights,” Choi wrote in her letter to the Supreme Court. Kim, from the Korea Women’s Hot-Line counseling center, said while there’s still work to be done, attitudes toward victims of sexual violence have changed dramatically. “The perception that the sexual aggressor is at fault, not the victim, that women are more vulnerable to sexual crimes, and it’s the government’s responsibility to punish the perpetrator and protect the victim is so widely spread out among the people now,” she said. Protests in solidarity With the help of the Korea Women’s Hot-Line, Choi requested a retrial in 2020, but the court denied her application, calling the original ruling “inevitable” due to the “circumstances of the time.” Choi condemned that decision as “truly embarrassing.” “I was so tired, having come such a long way, that I wanted to lay everything down,” she wrote in her letter last year to the Supreme Court. But she persisted, driven by the thought of “women of future generations.” A petition by the Korea Women’s Hot-Line gathered more than 15,000 signatures and Choi started a one-person relay protest in front of the Supreme Court for a month to pressure the highest court to annul the original decision to deny a retrial. In total, 42 people including Choi took part, swapping out after each day of protest, to show their solidarity with her cause. The Supreme Court granted her request, calling Choi’s testimonies about unfair treatment during investigation by the prosecutors “consistent” and “credible,” adding that there was no evidence that contradicted her claims. “Every drop of water pierced the rock. When I heard the news, I shouted hooray!” Choi said in a live-streamed press conference after the Supreme Court’s ruling in December. The retrial will be held at the Busan District Court, which originally dismissed Choi’s retrial application in 2021. The right to self-defense Choi’s long fight for justice is well known in South Korea. Her case is even cited in the Criminal Procedure Act textbook – used to educate generations of student lawyers – as an example of using excessive force in defense. A successful retrial could expand the definition of self-defense and set new protections for future victims of sexual violence, said Kim from the Korea Women’s Hot-Line. “I think it will become a very important case in getting women’s rights to defense, their responses against domestic or sexual violence, acknowledged more widely,” she said. In 2017, a woman was found guilty of grievous bodily harm, like Choi, for biting the tongue of a man who allegedly tried to rape her. The Incheon District Court partially acknowledged the man’s fault, but sentenced the woman to six months of imprisonment and two years on probation, citing the severity of the injury and “the failure to reach a settlement.” Kim said there’s still a perception among investigators and the courts that victims are responsible for sexual violence, particularly in cases involving “the victim going to the aggressor’s house, drinking together or going to a place where they’re left alone.” According to police statistics, more than 22,000 rapes and indecent assaults occurred in 2023 in South Korea. It’s unclear how many victims were charged after trying to defend themselves. Kim said there were still “many cases of women’s right to defense not being recognized.” In her letter to the Supreme Court, Choi said old, victim-blaming beliefs must change if women’s rights are to improve in South Korea. “I believe that women will only be able to protect themselves from sexual abuse and make a world without sexual violence when the court indisputably redefines victim and perpetrator, recognizes self-defense, and changes the outdated law,” she wrote.",,0.2698560357093811
"Recent Pentagon policies are having direct impacts on students at Defense Department schools around the globe and leaving students and their parents concerned they’re being disadvantaged by attending the schools, multiple students and parents told CNN. Many of the changes stem from President Donald Trump’s executive order banning programs or initiatives related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI. But Pentagon policies putting a freeze on civilian employees’ government credit cards, and broader freezes on the civilian workforce, are also impacting DOD families living abroad. Recent policies from the Pentagon under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth briefly impacted student-athletes’ ability to travel to games or competitions in Europe; the availability of at least one AP class, which parents and students say is not expected to be offered because portions of the instruction mention gender and sexuality; student clubs; what books are offered in school libraries; and more. “These kids in the [Department of Defense Education Activity] schools are taking the brunt of this administration’s decisions,” one DOD civilian in Germany, whose child is a high school sophomore, told CNN. The civilian added that while schools back in the US are insulated from some administration policy changes, DoDEA schools have no such ability. “Here, they send down this edict and it has to be obeyed,” the civilian said. “It’s not a state thing — it’s directly from someone who is in authority over the school. It’s concerning.” The feelings over those policies resulted in organized walkouts on Thursday at more than a dozen DoDEA schools around the globe. “We stood for every voice that’s been silenced. For every story that’s been erased. For every student who’s been told they don’t belong,” a post on a public Instagram page for the walkouts said on Thursday. “We walked out because our schools should be places of learning, not censorship.” Students and parents alike say the changes in their schools are disadvantaging students compared to their peers in the US. Multiple parents and students told CNN that AP Psychology will no longer be offered in DoDEA schools because of the DEI policies instituted by the Defense Department. A DoDEA high school sophomore, who spoke to CNN with her parent’s permission, said she’d been looking forward to taking AP Psychology and it was “disappointing that I can’t take the class I wanted to take.” “It’s frustrating we can’t get the same level of education as my peers in the states … we just already have less opportunities than schools in America, and this is narrowing our opportunities even more,” the sophomore said. Will Griffin, a spokesman for DoDEA, told CNN students “are at the heart of everything we do in DoDEA and we will continue to maintain a learning environment where all students can learn, grow, and prepare for success in college and careers.” “DoDEA remains committed to providing a high-quality education to military-connected students – as evidenced by DoDEA student performance on the 2022 and 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (known as ‘The Nation’s Report Card’) as the top school system in the country,” Griffin said. As for AP Psychology, Griffin said DoDEA is “continuing to work with the College Board concerning scheduling AP Psychology as a course” in the 2025-2026 school year. Still, a second DOD civilian in Germany, who is also a DoDEA parent, told CNN there is concern about students having less to “distinguish themselves for college” against their peers who didn’t go to DoDEA schools. “They come up with these policies and they are not actually thinking about the overseas demographic … It also feels like well, they don’t care about Europe — we all saw that in the Signal chat — but do they care about the service members over here?” the second DOD civilian said. “Do they care about the families over here?” As a direct result of the new administration’s policies, students at DoDEA schools around the globe participated in walkouts on Thursday. The organized protest was expected to include more than a dozen schools, from England and Germany to South Korea and Japan. “[A]t the beginning of February, when the executive orders were implemented, we saw things like Black History Month were taken away, posters around school … were like stripped from the walls, and clubs were disbanded,” said one student named Payton, who is only being identified by their first name and also spoke to CNN with his parent’s permission. “It’s not about politics,” another student who participated in South Korea told CNN. “It’s not about hating America … it’s more about protecting the rights for every student regardless of their identity.” “We really want to show the higher-ups in DoDEA that we aren’t going to accept our schools becoming political battlegrounds,” the student in South Korea said. The DoDEA high school sophomore in Germany pointed to how policies have impacted teachers’ ability to communicate with students; she said teachers have been told to address transgender teenagers by the names and pronouns given to them at birth instead of their chosen names or pronouns. “Transgender kids at my school — they’re supposed to call them by their birth name rather than the name they prefer,” the high school student said, adding the change is “alarming due to the high suicide rates among LGBT youth.” The student in South Korea, who is on the student yearbook staff, said they’ve even been told they have to refer to transgender students by their birth names in the student yearbook. “We have a problem … where our transgender students are already targeted,” the student said, “and now we’re making this a permanent part of their high school history.” In the lead-up to the organized walkouts, DoDEA school administrators sent out letters to parents, warning them that their child could receive an unexcused absence if they participated. In similar walkouts over the last several weeks, parents and students said, they had received excused absences. Griffin, the DoDEA spokesman, said DoDEA “does not support or endorse student walkouts,” and will “continue to encourage students to explore other avenues for civil engagement.” “While student-led walkouts in the past have concluded without serious incidents, the cumulative disruption to the DoDEA school system negatively impacted classroom instruction and pulled resources away from normal school operations to ensure student safety,” Griffin said. The warnings seemed to have an impact; the student in South Korea said fewer students participated than expected, and the first DOD civilian in Germany said nearly half of the students who participated in a walkout at his child’s high school last month did not participate on Thursday. The second DOD civilian in Germany who is a DoDEA parent said the walkouts are an example of how in-tune that generation is with the news and current events. “I think that some adults, if you don’t have kids in that age group, you make an assumption that they’re not informed,” the civilian said. “But they’re way more informed than you realize, and doing a lot more research than you realize.” The two DoDEA parents who spoke to CNN — whose children go to separate schools ­— told CNN parents have largely been left in the dark on how DOD policies are impacting schools. When schools began pulling books from libraries, for example, they weren’t told what criteria the schools were using or what books were being removed. “That is the argument they’re using in every other state – parental involvement, parental authority,” the first DOD civilian in Germany said. “But here, they’re completely cutting parents out of the loop.” Griffin, the DoDEA spokesman, said based on Trump’s executive orders and Hegseth’s guidance, DoDEA is reviewing policies and library books to ensure compliance, and “limiting access to materials under review” in the meantime. The vague DEI orders have left leaders at every echelon stressed, the second DOD civilian said, feeling that the Pentagon has pushed down rushed orders without any effective guidance. And the lack of guidance “feels on purpose,” the civilian said, “so that when somebody goes too far, and everyone complains about it, they [the administration] have the ability to say, ‘Well, we didn’t tell them to do that.’” “Everyone is seeing it, everyone is feeling it,” the civilian said of the palpable stress overseas. “It’s felt at every level.”",,0.2953289747238159

It was such a joy for me to return there today – after 13 long years – to be surrounded by the mountains, dip my hands in the cold river and laugh with my beloved cousins. This place is very dear to my heart and I hope to return again and again.” In October 2012, Yousafzai was shot in the head by the Taliban while riding a bus home from school. In the days that followed the shocking attack, the teenager was airlifted to hospital in Birmingham, England for life-saving surgery. She and her family settled in Britain, where she went on to graduate from Oxford University. She has since devoted her working life to campaigning for educational rights for girls and women around the world under the umbrella of the international non-profit organization the Malala Fund. A police official told CNN that Yousafzai was accompanied on the emotional visit – close to where she was shot – by members of her immediate family.

"Separatist militants killed at least 10 people after hijacking a train carrying hundreds of passengers in Pakistan’s southwestern province of Balochistan on Tuesday, according to government and railway officials. Nine of those killed were security personnel, Imran Hayat, a senior railway official, told CNN Tuesday night, adding that a train driver was also killed in the attack. It is unclear exactly when the deaths occurred. Earlier Tuesday, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind told CNN that “intense gunfire” had been reported on the train. Tuesday evening, security sources not authorized to speak on the record told CNN that security forces had “surrounded the terrorists” and an exchange of fire had taken place. The security sources added that the militants were using “women and children as shields.” The train, known as the Jaffer Express, was stopped by the militants as it reached a tunnel on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. The train was on its way from Quetta in Balochistan, Pakistan’s westernmost province, to the northwestern city of Peshawar. “Armed individuals stopped Jaffer Express inside Tunnel No. 8 (in Bolan),” Muhammad Kashif, Quetta Railways’ controller, told CNN. The train, which departed from Quetta at 9 a.m. local time, had nine coaches and was carrying approximately 450 passengers, Kashif said. By Tuesday night, 104 hostages had been freed by security forces, the security sources told CNN. Those released included 58 men, 31 women and 15 children, the security sources said, adding that injured passengers had been taken to hospital and that work to rescue the remaining hostages was still underway. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The BLA had said in an earlier statement seen by CNN that they had taken hostages from the train who would be “executed” if a security operation takes place. But Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said Tuesday evening that operations will continue “until the last terrorist is eliminated.” On Tuesday night, the security sources told CNN that 16 militants had been killed and many more had been injured. The militants have been split into small groups and are surrounded by the security forces, the sources said. Related article
      At least 30 dead in Balochistan explosions, day before Pakistan election Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind told CNN that access to the train, which was being held in Balochistan’s mountainous region of Sibi, he said, was “challenging.” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement Tuesday that he “strongly condemns” the attack. “The terrorists’ targeting of innocent passengers during the peaceful and blessed month of Ramadan is a clear reflection that these terrorists have no connection with the religion of Islam, Pakistan (or) Balochistan,” Sharif said. Junaid Ahmed, from Quetta, told CNN that his cousins were traveling on the Jaffer Express at the time of the incident. “When I found out about the train incident, I lost contact with them. I came here (Quetta Railway Station), but officials here are saying that (they) are unable to make any contact too.” The Balochistan government had directed emergency response efforts, Rind said, with a relief train sent to the scene. On Friday, in a letter seen by CNN, Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department had issued a threat alert, regarding “a planned attack” by the BLA and asked “all concerned authorities” to “take extraordinary precautions and safety measures to prevent any occurrence.” An insurgency in Balochistan has been running for decades, but has gained traction in recent years since the province’s deep-water Gwadar port was leased to China, the jewel in the crown of Beijing’s “Belt and Road” infrastructure push in Pakistan. Militants are angered by what they say is the state’s exploitation of the region’s rich mineral resources, with little of the proceeds filtering down to people in what remains Pakistan’s poorest province. The port, often touted as “the next Dubai,” has become a security nightmare with persistent bombings of vehicles carrying Chinese workers, with many killed.

"Nearly 350 hostages were rescued at the end of a deadly standoff between Pakistan’s military and armed militants who hijacked a train in the southwestern Pakistani province of Balochistan, a security source told CNN Wednesday. The incident, which began Tuesday, left dozens dead. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group active in the restive and mineral-rich Balochistan province, claimed responsibility for the attack. A total of 27 hostages were killed by the BLA, the security source said, as well as one soldier. At least 35 militants were killed in the rescue operation, the security source added. Around 450 passengers were on the Jaffer Express en route from Balochistan’s capital Quetta to Peshawar in the north, when militants opened “intense gunfire” as the train traveled through a tunnel early in its journey, according to officials. Pakistan’s military then launched an operation to confront the attackers who used “women and children as shields,” according to security sources not authorized to speak to CNN. Passenger Mohammad Ashraf told CNN he saw more than 100 armed individuals on the train and that no harm was inflicted on women and children. One rescued woman described scenes of chaos following the attack, likening it to the “Day of Judgement.” She told CNN she fled gunfire and walked for two hours to reach safety. Survivor Arslan Yousaf recalled the terrifying moment the hijacking began. “As soon as the explosion happened, armed men stormed the train. They had launchers, guns, and other weapons, and they immediately started firing – shooting directly at people,” he told Reuters. “They kept shouting, ‘We will kill anyone who doesn’t come out.’ Then, things took a darker turn. They began checking everyone’s ID cards - Punjabis, Sindhis, Baloch. They separated us into groups. Sometimes, they took soldiers outside and executed them. Other times, they targeted specific individuals. If they had a grudge against someone, they shot him on the spot.” Muhammad Tanveer, who was held hostage for two days, told Reuters the hostages didn’t have any food and had to resort to drinking water from the train’s washroom. “Then, last night (Wednesday), our army arrived. By evening, they had cleared everything. They gave us protection, served us food and water, and took care of the situation,” he said. The security sources accused the militants of being in contact with handlers in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s military and government have long accused Afghanistan of providing sanctuary to militant groups, something its Taliban leaders have denied. An evolving insurgency Tuesday’s kidnapping is an audacious moment for a separatist insurgency that seeks greater political autonomy and economic development in the strategically important and mineral-rich mountainous region. But it also highlights the ever-deteriorating security situation there – one that Pakistan’s government has been grappling with for decades. Balochistan’s population – made up mostly of the ethnic Baloch group – is deeply disenfranchised, impoverished, and has grown increasingly alienated from the federal government by decades of policies widely seen as discriminatory. An insurgency there has been ongoing for decades but has gained traction in recent years since the province’s deep-water Gwadar port was leased to China, the jewel in the crown of Beijing’s “Belt and Road” infrastructure push in Pakistan. The port, often touted as “the next Dubai,” has become a security nightmare with persistent bombings of vehicles carrying Chinese workers, resulting in many deaths. Some analysts said Tuesday’s attack marked an escalation in the sophistication of attacks by the insurgents. The “larger point that the Pakistani state is not grasping … is that it’s not business as usual anymore,” said Abdul Basit, a senior associate fellow at the S.

      Pakistan’s shiny new Balochistan airport is just missing one thing: passengers “The insurgency has evolved both in its strategy and scale,” he added, saying Pakistan’s approach to tackle the Baloch militants “seems to have run its course.” “Instead of revising its counterproductive policies, it is persisting with them, resulting in recurrent security and intelligence failures,” Basit said. The BLA has been responsible for the deadliest attacks in Pakistan in the past year. A suicide bombing by the BLA at a train station in Quetta killed more than two dozen people last November. The previous month, it claimed responsibility for an attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers, resulting in two deaths. In the wake of Tuesday’s attack, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to “continue to fight against the monster of terrorism until it is completely eradicated from the country.” In a statement, he said the “terrorists’ targeting of innocent passengers during the peaceful and blessed month of Ramadan is a clear reflection that these terrorists have no connection with the religion of Islam, Pakistan and Balochistan.” Analysts say such attacks need urgent attention from the federal government. “(Tuesday’s attack) has gained global attention and it will worry China, which has its investments in the province – more than any other state,” Basit said. “A major reset of existing security paradigm is required in Balochistan.” This story has been updated with additional information.",,0.2464328408241272
"Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action. Footage of four, rarely-seen snow leopards clambering up snowy cliffs in northern Pakistan has created a frenzy of excitement among conservationists. Snow leopards are among the world’s most elusive creatures in the wild and it is hard to catch even one on camera, let alone four, with the sighting being celebrated as a success story for Pakistan’s conservation efforts. Sakhawat Ali, a gamekeeper and photography enthusiast from the remote village of Hushe, captured the footage on March 13 after what he described as “two weeks of tracking their pawprints” through the snow-covered Central Karakoram National Park - close to K2, the world’s second highest mountain. Ali told CNN the four snow leopards were a mother and her three cubs. “In the village we are used to seeing snow leopards but, nobody, not even the elders that I spoke to, have ever seen four snow leopards in one go,” he said. He spotted the mother first, then started noting additional pawprints. He later “got lucky” sighting the animals together while observing a nearby cliff, through binoculars, from the rooftop of his house. He them scampered out with his camera to film them, from a distance of 200 meters. Ali said neighbors from his village are celebrating the sighting - even though they have some concerns that their livestock could be in danger. Snow leopards are currently listed as “vulnerable” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Known locally as the “ghost of the mountains,” they camouflage easily in their natural habitat of the Karakoram Mountain range in Pakistan’s Gilgit Baltistan region. Environmental anthropologist Shafqat Hussain says the rocky terrain in the north of Pakistan is perhaps the “best snow leopard habitat in the world.” They only inhabit high alpine areas of the Himalayas and while their habitat spreads over 12 nations, including China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Mongolia, sightings are exceedingly rare.

      ‘I’ve never seen a snow leopard in the wild’ – the anthropologist who has spent two decades protecting Pakistan’s elusive big cats Dr Zakir Hussain, Chief Conservator Parks and Wildlife for Gilgit-Baltistan told CNN that the sighting was a “win” for the work being done to increase awareness amongst local communities about the importance of protecting snow leopards. He said eighty percent of community members are now involved in conservation, tracking and awareness activities. The World Wildlife Fund for Nature, Pakistan, said it was optimistic about the sighting but  stressed snow leopards remain an endangered species still facing “numerous threats.” In a statement, it said it’s crucial that local communities “work together to protect and conserve these incredible big cats, ensuring future generations can witness their splendor in the wild.” According to the United Nation’s Environment Program “human activities and growing livestock herds in some areas have led to the degradation of pastureland and wildlife habitats,” affecting the snow leopards food supplies. Other threats according to the UNEP include poaching and the fragmentation of the animal’s habitat due to massive new infrastructure projects in addition to climate change - which is “expected to aggravate these existing threats.” In 2023, Pakistan was ranked as the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change according to the World Bank’s Global Climate Risk Index.",,0.29720762372016907
"The first time he flew his cargo plane through the clouds over his hometown of Kabul, Tauheed Khan swelled with pride. “I flew over my childhood home,” he told CNN, on a quiet spring morning in the Pakistani capital Islamabad. “And I was so proud, there was so much joy that I can still taste it, still feel it in my heart.” During the US-led, 20-year war against the Taliban, Afghan Air Force pilots played a key role alongside American counterparts, some carrying out strikes that inflicted heavy casualties on the hardline Islamists. That coalition ended in August 2021, when foreign troops withdrew and Kabul fell to the Taliban. Khan now finds himself in neighboring Pakistan with his young family, fearing that they could be killed if they return to an Afghanistan now under the grip of the very forces he fought against. Worsening their plight, anti-migrant policies in both Washington and Islamabad mean time is running out to find a safe alternative, including a looming deadline at the end of this month.

      Tattoos, flyers and deleted photos: The limited evidence the Trump administration is using to try to deport migrants The war, which began with the US invasion in 2001 following the September 11 attacks, devastated Afghanistan’s civilian population, which is still recovering. The ousting of the Taliban by the US-led coalition led to profound changes, including a return of democracy and significant improvements for Afghanistan’s women. But war and instability raged across swathes of the nation, especially in rural areas. Tens of thousands were killed. Civilian losses escalated to 5,183 dead in the first six months of 2021, as the US began to pull out from Afghanistan and depend further on the Afghan military. A five-year study published by the United Nations in 2021 showed that 785 children died from US and AAF airstrikes over that period. As the US finally pulled out, the Afghan army and government collapsed, allowing Taliban fighters to sweep back into power. Afghans affiliated with the former government are “most at risk” from the new Taliban administration, according to a report published by Human Rights Watch. HRW and the United Nations have documented “extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detention, and torture and other ill-treatment” of Afghans who were in the security forces. ‘Pilots risk everything’ Due to their high visibility in the local community, many pilots feared revenge attacks after the Taliban takeover. Khan told CNN that in his time in the air force, “eight to 10” of his colleagues were killed in “targeted explosions and shootings” by the Taliban. Shawn Vandiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a leading US coalition of resettlement and veterans’ groups, told CNN that “these pilots risked everything for America. Their lives are now on the line because of our failure to follow through on our promises.” Khan’s friend, 37-year-old Khapalwaka is equally terrified. A trained aviation engineer, he worked as part of the AAF’s intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance program. His job involved clearing out civilian areas before they were targeted by US drone strikes. He said he was assigned the task by his superiors, something he had often protested. “I soon became a target of the local Taliban faction,” said Khapalwaka, who had to move house every “three to four months” for safety reasons, even before Kabul fell. Now selling wood by the roadside to feed his family, Khapalwaka – who, like Khan, was speaking under a pseudonym – said he’s concerned the Taliban could reach him in Pakistan too. “I know that they have contacts here, that they could target me here if they wanted… I just want to get out of here, so my daughters have a chance to be educated.” The Afghan Taliban denied that former pilots were at risk if they returned. “We don’t have any problem with them,” spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid told CNN. “The pilots who want to return to Afghanistan are needed because they are an asset to the country and important military personnel. Some of their colleagues are already at work, serving the nation, and they will also be treated with dignity.” The US embassy in Islamabad did not respond to a request to comment. Left in limbo Khan sat in a small room of his tiny apartment in a non-descript Islamabad building. Bedspreads shrouded windows as makeshift curtains, but slivers of sunlight poked through, making harsh blotches on the faces of his small children, who slept tucked together in frayed blankets on the floor, oblivious to the sound around them. The youngest child was awake and constantly jumping on Khan’s lap as he spoke of the life he left behind. In the chaos that ensued after the US withdrawal, Khan got to Pakistan in March 2022. He arrived legally and on foot, following the advice of a US pilot who had been one of his trainers. We don’t have options in Pakistan, what can we do, please for the love of God get us out of here. We don’t have a life here; we are choking with fear Jawad Ahmed Khan told CNN that he had been following the steps of the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) and, after two years of waiting, finally made it to the US embassy for an interview in April last year, with a view to resettling in the US. Since then, Khan said, there has been “silence.” In the past two months, White House policy has moved in a less predictable, more anti-migrant direction under President Donald Trump, throwing into doubt the prospects for Afghans such as Khan. Tens of thousands of Afghans have already been caught in limbo due to other Trump administration executive orders suspending the US refugee admissions program and the suspension of foreign aid funding for flights of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders. According to #AfghanEvac, at least 2,000 Afghans who had previously been approved to resettle in the US are currently in limbo. And there are fears of a travel ban even bigger than the one the US president imposed during his previous term, with a US official familiar with the situation telling CNN that Afghanistan could be among the countries affected. March 31 deadline for Afghans in Pakistan And the days of Pakistan offering at least relative safety may be numbered. Home to one of the world’s largest refugee populations – most of them from Afghanistan – Pakistan has not always welcomed the foreigners, subjecting them to hostile living conditions and threatening deportation over the years. According to the UN refugee agency, more than 3 million Afghan refugees, including registered refugees and more than 800,000 undocumented people, are living in Pakistan. Islamabad has been cracking down on Afghan refugees since October 2023. It had shown leniency towards Afghans awaiting settlement elsewhere, but that changed after an announcement this February that it would repatriate “Afghan nationals bound for 3rd country resettlement,” by March 31. Abbas Khan, Pakistan’s chief commissioner for Afghan refugees, told CNN that his country “simply doesn’t have the resources to support” migrants in transit. That deadline will arrive on the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr, which ends the holy month of Ramadan. It is a time of celebration, feasting and gift-giving, but for Jawad Ahmed, a former Black Hawk helicopter pilot with the AAF, it feels like “all days are melting into one”. Ahmed, who is fasting for Ramadan, told CNN he “was always afraid something can happen to my family,” because of his military past. “I was known in my hometown as someone who worked with the US military and I was a military man myself,” said Ahmed, whose name has also been changed at his request to protect his identity. He arrived in Pakistan legally and was in limbo for two years. He said he interviewed with US immigration officers in May of 2024 and had his medical interview on January 10 at the US embassy. Since then, like many others including Khan, Ahmad has heard nothing from any US embassy official. Ahmed spoke of seeing Pakistani police “whisk away” his Afghan neighbors, with an increase in raids over the last two months. His children are “overwhelmed with fear and terror.” ‘Death, difficulties and horrors’ But returning to Afghanistan could be even worse, according to Ahmed. “Only death, difficulties and horrors await us there” he said. Ahmed’s family in Afghanistan have adopted new names and identities for their safety, eking out a life in a new province. “Nobody knows about me where they are, nobody knows that they had a son, that they had a brother, in their new world it’s as if I never existed.” He repeatedly asks for his message to be shared with President Trump and the US government. “You trained us, we were there for you in a difficult time, we stood shoulder to shoulder with you,” said Ahmed. “We don’t have options in Pakistan, what can we do, please for the love of God get us out of here. We don’t have a life here; we are choking with fear.” A serving US air force pilot, who asked to remain anonymous, has been assisting Afghan pilots they served alongside. “When the country fell apart, I was inundated with calls for assistance. Like many service members in my same situation, I did what I could and attempted to lean into the problem” the pilot told CNN. “I raised money and wrote memos of support.” While serving soldiers have had some success helping families escape to the US, they still “fear for” their Afghan counterparts stuck in Pakistan and other countries and have “anxiety about their current situation and their future,” the pilot said. Abandoning former partners, according to Vandiver of #AfghanEvac, sends a “chilling message to future US allies – whether in Ukraine, Taiwan, or elsewhere – that partnering with the US is a death sentence once the war ends.” “China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia are going to eat our lunch because of this.” A spokesperson for the US embassy said it remains in close communication with Pakistan on the status of Afghan nationals seeking resettlement in America. As Eid approaches, Tauheed Khan and his friendship group of 27 Afghan pilots and engineers stuck in Islamabad, dream of eating meat to end their fast, of access to education for their children, of new clothes, a better home to live in with proper beds and of a way out. “We are scared we will be dragged out,” says Khan. “We are under too much pressure, we don’t know what’s going to happen.”",,0.2567741274833679
"North Korea appears to have sent at least 3,000 more soldiers to Russia early this year, South Korea’s military said Thursday, demonstrating Pyongyang’s continued support for Moscow’s war on Ukraine as world leaders push for an end to the three-year conflict. The news comes as Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said a visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Russia is being prepared, according to state media TASS. The reinforcements, sent in January and February, add to the roughly 11,000 troops North Korea has sent to Russia so far, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. About 4,000 of them have been killed or injured in combat, according to Seoul. Pyongyang has also sent a “significant amount” of short-range ballistic missiles and about 220 pieces of 170-millimeter self-propelled howitzers and 240-millimeter multiple rocket launchers, South Korea said. It said the North’s contributions are “expected to increase according to the situation.” While North Korea appears to be ramping up its support for Russia’s war, European leaders and allies are set to meet in Paris Thursday to discuss aid for Ukraine and long-term stability in the region, amid shaky efforts by the White House to broker a ceasefire. Following talks in Saudi Arabia this week, the US said both Russia and Ukraine agreed to stop using force in the Black Sea and uphold a previously announced pause on attacks against energy infrastructure. But Russia introduced some far-reaching conditions for signing up to the partial truce, which falls far short of a 30-day full ceasefire initially proposed by the White House. The Kremlin said it would only implement the agreements once sanctions on its banks and exports are lifted, showing the significant gulf in expectations between the negotiating parties. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, have been deepening security ties since they signed a landmark defense pact last year and pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked. Putin’s top security adviser Sergei Shoigu met with Kim last week in Pyongyang, where he conveyed Putin’s “warmest wishes and greetings,” Russian state-run news agency TASS reported. “He pays the utmost attention to the implementation of agreements reached with you,” Shoigu told Kim, according to TASS. Deepening partnership The United States has warned that Russia may be close to sharing advanced space and satellite technology with North Korea, on top of military equipment and training it is already providing, in exchange for North Korean support for the war in Ukraine. North Korean troops had been deployed to the Russian region of Kursk to repel Ukraine’s incursion since at least November. But they withdrew from the front lines in January after reports of mass casualties, Ukrainian officials said. Related article
      Satellite images show how hundreds of North Korean troops were likely transported to a secluded Russian port South Korean lawmaker Yoo Yong-won, who visited Ukraine in late February, said about 400 North Korean soldiers in Russia had been killed and about 3,600 injured as of February 26. CNN has previously reported on the brutal and near-suicidal tactics of North Korean soldiers, who in some cases have detonated grenades rather than be captured by Ukrainian forces, and have written pledges of allegiance to Kim on the battlefield. Since the war began, North Korea has also sent thousands of shipping containers of munitions or munitions-related material to Russia, and Moscow’s forces have launched North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine, according to US officials. North Korean medical facilities have also treated hundreds of Russian soldiers injured in Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Pyongyang said in an interview with state-run outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta in February. Meanwhile, Russia supplies North Korea with coal, food and medicine, Ambassador Alexander Matsegora told the outlet. He also said children of Russian troops killed in Ukraine had vacationed in North Korea last summer, and Russia and North Korea are developing student exchanges. North Korean drones South Korean officials have echoed US concerns that the deepening partnership between Russia and North Korea could facilitate technology transfers to the Kim regime. This week, Kim oversaw a test of new AI-powered attack drones, North Korean state-run news agency KCNA reported, and directed that they be further developed “in keeping with the trend of modern warfare.” Pyongyang also unveiled a new reconnaissance drone that could have partly come from Russia, South Korea’s military said Thursday. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Seong-jun said that the aircraft model had been modified from an original North Korean plane, but the “internal equipment and such parts could be related to Russia.” Related article
      Russia may be ‘dragging feet’ on achieving peace in Ukraine, Trump says Drones have become a central weapon in the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The number of Russian drone attacks on Ukraine skyrocketed from just 379 in May 2024 to nearly 2,500 in November. Amid ongoing talks of a ceasefire, Ukraine and Russia have continued to exchange attacks. Late Wednesday, Russian forces launched a massive drone attack on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, injuring at least nine people and damaging civilian infrastructure, Ukrainian authorities said. “No country should have to go through this,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram following the attack. In an interview with Newsmax Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said he believes Russia wants to end the war, but “it could be they’re dragging their feet.” CNN’s Gawon Bae and Sebastian Shukla contributed reporting.",,0.22323188185691833
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said two Chinese nationals fighting in the Russian army have been taken prisoner in eastern Ukraine. Zelensky said Tuesday that Ukrainian forces fighting in the Donetsk region obtained the Chinese nationals’ documents, bank cards and personal data. “We have information that there are many more Chinese citizens in the occupier’s units than just two. We are now finding out all the facts,” Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. “I have instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to immediately contact Beijing and find out how China is going to react to this.” Related article
      Zelensky confirms for first time that Ukrainian troops active in Russia’s Belgorod region “Russia’s involvement of China in this war in Europe, directly or indirectly, is a clear signal that Putin is going to do anything except end the war. He is looking for ways to continue fighting,” Zelensky said. The Ukrainian president also called on its allies in the United States and Europe to protest. It is unclear if the Chinese nationals that Ukraine says it captured are Chinese soldiers or volunteers. Western officials on Tuesday told CNN that they did not see “evidence of state sponsorship” in their cases. US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said it was “disturbing” to see the reports. “China is a major enabler of Russia in the war in Ukraine. China provides nearly 80% of dual-use items Russia needs to sustain the war,” said Bruce in a news conference on Tuesday. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Tuesday that Kyiv has summoned Beijing’s chargé d’affaires in Ukraine “to condemn this fact and demand an explanation.” “We hope that after this situation, the Americans will talk more with Ukrainians and then with Russians. And we hope that the Chinese side will also respond,” Zelensky said Tuesday afternoon during a news conference. “This is another country that militarily supports Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the side of Russia. This is another one after Iran and the North Korean military,” he added. China has consistently denied any involvement in the war. Beijing said on Wednesday that it was “currently verifying” the situation with Ukraine. “It is important to emphasize that the Chinese government has always instructed its citizens to stay away from areas of armed conflict and avoid getting involved in the conflict in any form, especially avoiding participation in any party’s military operations,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian said in a press conference on Wednesday. The Kremlin spokesperson on Wednesday declined to comment on the claim that Chinese nationals were allegedly captured in Ukraine. China has helped Russia ramp up its defense industrial base as it continues its war against Ukraine, senior Biden administration officials told CNN last year. The support China has provided includes significant quantities of machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and technology for cruise missiles, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, which Russia uses to make propellant for weapons, the officials said in April 2024. Meanwhile, Russia has also considerably strengthened its military relationship with North Korea over the last year, with the two signing a mutual defense agreement and Pyongyang sending its troops to fight for Moscow in Ukraine. In January, Ukrainian forces operating in the Kursk region of Russia captured two North Korean soldiers. Russia reclaiming ground in Kursk region Russian attacks on Ukraine in the last 24 hours killed at least three people and injured 19 others, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia carried out attacks on the Ukrainian regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kherson, local officials said. Elsewhere on the front lines, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that it has retaken one of the last villages held by Ukraine in the Kursk region, months after Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion. “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continue to defeat the Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the Kursk region. Units of the North group of forces have liberated the settlement of Guyevo in the Kursk region during offensive operations,” the Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement. US-based conflict monitor the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in an update Monday that Russian forces have recently advanced in Kursk. ISW’s map of the incursion shows that Ukrainian troops remain only in small parts of the Russian region. Ukrainian troops have occupied part of the Kursk region since August 2024, though Russian forces have since recaptured much of the territory. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian regiment released video on Tuesday showing strikes on Russia’s neighboring Belgorod region, one day after Zelensky confirmed for the first time on Monday that his country’s troops have been active in the region as they seek to protect Ukrainian towns near the border. Ukraine’s 225th separate assault regiment said the video shows its forces destroying two bridges in Belgorod, in the villages of Grafovka and Nadezhevka. CNN has verified that those are the locations shown in the video. “Then the drone operations and clearing the ground followed,” the regiment said in a Telegram post, confirming their presence on the ground in Russian territory. Ukrainian forces began limited attacks in Russia’s northwestern Belgorod region on March 18, according to ISW, in areas just across the border from Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry previously said it defeated Ukrainian troops attacking Belgorod. CNN’s Anna Chernova and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.",,0.2321361005306244
"North Korea on Sunday is holding its first Pyongyang International Marathon in six years, hosting foreign runners in the reclusive country that had largely closed its borders during the pandemic. Athletes from China, Romania and other countries have arrived in North Korea to participate in the event, state media KCNA news agency and Rodong Sinmun reported on Sunday. About 200 travelers came into Pyongyang on Friday and Saturday, and runners from overseas practiced at a hotel in Pyongyang for the Sunday race, said Simon Cockerell, general manager at Beijing-based Koryo Tours, in his Instagram posts showing streets and a recreational area in Pyongyang. Koryo Tours is the official partner of the Pyongyang Marathon, helping arrange the sign-up process for international visitors for the event. The isolated state sealed its borders in 2020 at the start of the pandemic but has been slowly lifting restrictions since 2023. It allowed some Russian tourist groups into the country but its capital still remains closed to regular tourism. The marathon is a return course run through central Pyongyang, passing Pyongyang’s landmarks, heading out into the countryside just outside of the city centre, and coming back to the stadium with a crowd of 50,000 locals, according to Koryo Tours.

"Japan’s largest yakuza crime syndicate has pledged to end its longstanding war with a rival faction and refrain from causing “trouble,” authorities said, as the mafia-like groups contend with falling membership and increased police crackdowns. Three senior members of the Yamaguchi-gumi visited the Hyogo Prefectural police headquarters on Monday and delivered a letter to officers pledging to “end all internal fighting” and to “never cause any trouble,” police told CNN. The Yamaguchi-gumi, one of the world’s largest and wealthiest crime gangs, has been embroiled in a bloody feud with splinter groups since 2015, when more than a dozen factions broke away to form the Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi. Since then, intensifying violence between the two warring crime organizations has seen rival gangsters gunned down or stabbed in dozens of incidents, according to police. The armed conflict, often erupting on public streets in cities across central and western Japan, has put pressure on authorities to toughen restrictions on the gangs. “Yakuza” is a blanket term for Japan’s organized crime groups, which sit in a gray area in the country. Though they are not outlawed, the groups are regulated and monitored by authorities. In 2020, police formally designated the Yamaguchi-gumi and its splinter group as gangs at war - giving officers the ability to increase surveillance, restrict their activities, including prohibiting the use of their offices and ability to raise funds. Related article
      The yakuza: Inside Japan’s murky criminal underworld “Their conflicts have become serious and unpredictable,” the National Police Agency said in 2021. In the past five years, police have also put several other gangs under close surveillance. It is unclear whether the rival splinter group, Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi, has responded to the ceasefire pledge. Police said they would be “closely monitoring the movements of both groups” as the declaration to end the turf war may be one-sided. Membership to yakuza groups across Japan has been in decline over recent decades. In 2024, the number of members of organized crime syndicates stood at 18,800, hitting a record low and falling below 20,000 for the first time, according to police data. Those official figures show the number of active members of the Yamaguchi-gumi gang have almost halved since 2014 - falling from 6,000 then to just 3,300 at the end of last year. The Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi had around 120 members last year. As yakuza membership falls, however, Japanese authorities are contending with a new criminal phenomenon: the “tokuryu.” These anonymous gangs are not affiliated with a yakuza family, operating individually or in ad hoc groups. About 10,000 members of tokuryu gangs were investigated last year, with police linking them to violent robberies in Tokyo, and fraud schemes involving romance scams and investments on social media.",,0.3802870512008667
"South Korea sent two helicopters to battle a wildfire inside the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), Seoul’s military said Friday, adding it had warned North Korea in advance of its firefighting mission along the heavily armed border area. The blaze in the east of the DMZ dividing the Koreas comes just weeks after South Korea suffered record deadly wildfires in the country’s southeast that forced communities to evacuate and destroyed thousands of structures, including a centuries-old Buddhist temple. South Korea’s military aired broadcasts to North Korea to warn people there about the helicopters early Friday, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. “Our military is maintaining readiness while closely monitoring North Korean activities,” the Joint Chiefs added. It’s unclear what caused the fire, which started Thursday afternoon in South Korea’s eastern Goseong county, Gangwon province, according to authorities. The Korea Forest Service said the blaze had been about half extinguished as of Friday morning, while the military said firefighting efforts were “proceeding smoothly” and there had been no damage to South Korean personnel or facilities. The DMZ is a no-man’s land about 30 miles north of Seoul that was established in the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement to provide distance between the two sides and prevent military brush-ups. The 160-mile-long, 2.5-mile-wide DMZ is one of the most heavily militarized borders in the world and both Seoul and Pyongyang maintain large numbers of troops there. It has been the site of high-level discussions on inter-Korea relations and is also a major tourist attraction. Largely devoid of human activity, the DMZ has inadvertently become one of the most pristine environments in Asia and a haven for wildlife. In 2023, Google released street-view images of the DMZ for the first time, offering a rare glimpse into the flora and fauna that inhabit the peaceful buffer. Inter-Korea hostilities have ramped up in recent years as North Korea appears to have intensified its nuclear production efforts and strengthened ties with Russia as it wages war in Ukraine. Last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea. Earlier this week, South Korea’s military said it had fired warning shots after North Korean soldiers crossed the military demarcation line before retreating.",,0.15163502097129822
"High atop the Korean Peninsula, past military checkpoints and bumpy dirt roads in one of the world’s most secretive countries, rises a volcano and deep crater lake steeped in symbolism. Mount Paektu, an active stratovolcano straddling the border of North Korea and China, is the highest peak on the Korean peninsula and lies at the heart of North Korea’s foundation myth. The North Korean side of the mountain was recently designated a UNESCO Global Geopark, marking North Korea’s first natural site to be included on the list. The executive board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized the site for its “impressive natural and cultural heritage,” including its volcanic eruptions and geological features, in a meeting held in February. But to grasp the significance, you have to stand at the edge of Lake Chon — a caldera around 7,200 feet above sea level, formed by a massive eruption more than a thousand years ago — and feel the wind cut across your face. I did just that in June 2017, as one of the few Western journalists to reach Paektu’s summit from the North Korean side. The trip, sanctioned and closely monitored by Pyongyang, offered rare access — and a window into how the regime elevates this mountain into something almost divine. The ‘Mount Paektu bloodline’ The mountain was the birthplace of Dangun, the mythical founder of the first Korean kingdom, according to North Korean legend. Kim Il Sung, North Korea’s founder and Kim Jong Un’s grandfather, purportedly used the mountain as a hideout when fighting against the Japanese occupation for independence in the 1940s. State media often refers to the eldest Kim in reference to the mountain, using titles like the “legendary hero of Paektu.” North Korea claims Kim Jong Il, the late leader and father of Kim Jong Un, was born near Paektu’s summit. Guides showed me a wooden cabin where, they say, snow melted and the sun broke through, flowers bloomed, and a new star appeared in the sky to mark his birth. There’s no historical evidence for this and many scholars believe Kim was likely born in Russia, but the story is told without a hint of doubt throughout North Korea. Paektu isn’t just a mountain — it’s a national altar. The mountain has been widely used by the Kim dynasty to showcase the family’s own lore and deification. Its peaks have been emblazoned on the country’s national emblem and its name has been lent to everything from rockets to power stations and, occasionally, the country itself. North Korean society prizes racial purity and state propaganda glorifies the Kim family for their “Mount Paektu bloodline,” which is said to be a noble and heroic lineage tied to the ancient legendary kings of the Korean peninsula. “This is the soul of Korea’s revolution,” a guide told me, as North Korean pilgrims stood quietly nearby, some in tears, believing they were on hallowed ground. Kim Jong Un has often visited the sacred mountain, usually before major shakeups — like the 2013 execution of his uncle and the 2016 nuclear test. In 2018, he brought then-South Korean President Moon Jae-in up to the summit in a rare moment of unity. Moon, who stood at the top clutching Kim’s hand alongside their wives, called the visit the realization of a dream. “I wondered if I was ever going to have a chance (to come here) but my wish has come true,” Moon said. For Koreans on both sides of the border, reaching the peak has long been a rite of passage, but access has been closed off to most living in South Korea. In 2019, North Korean state media released photographs of Kim riding on a white horse up the sacred mountain on at least two separate occasions amid tensions on the peninsula. Geological significance In its recognition, the UNESCO executive board cited Paektu’s volcanic legacy, valleys shaped by glacial erosion, and rocky plains as part of its global significance. It also noted the “millennial eruption” that occurred on Mount Paektu more than a thousand years ago in 946 CE — one of the most powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history. Currently, there are more than 200 geoparks in 49 countries, according to the organization. UNESCO Global Geoparks are recognized as “single, unified geographical areas where sites and landscapes of international geological significance are managed with a holistic concept of protection, education and sustainable development.” Last year, the UNESCO board designated the Chinese side of the mountain as a global geopark under its Chinese name, Changbaishan.

      US tourists can’t visit North Korea. This American spent six figures on a second passport so he could travel there North Korea sought the UNESCO geopark designation in 2019, a year before China, but an on-site inspection of the site in North Korea was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With the designation, Pyongyang may now try to rebrand Paektu as a geotourism destination — promoting its natural wonders as well as Korean mythology. Back in 2017, the journey to Paektu took us through remote farming villages where children ran away from our cameras — some likely having never seen a foreigner. In Samjiyon, the closest town, monuments to Kim Il Sung dot the landscape, and buildings bear scars from battles with Japanese occupiers. Life near Paektu is rural and sparse. But the people we met spoke with quiet pride — of their history, their home, and the belief that they live in a place that matters. With this UNESCO recognition, Mount Paektu is now not just a national symbol, but recognized as a site of global geological value. Whether that leads to more engagement or remains another tool for Pyongyang’s narrative is unclear. For now, the mountain stands, its slopes cloaked in clouds and its stories passed down through generations. And if you ever find yourself at the summit, staring into Lake Chon and breathing in the frigid air, you might understand why so many, North and South, believe it holds the soul of Korea.

"Editor’s Note: Samantha Bresnahan is a supervising producer for CNN and author of the new book, “IN BLOOD, FLOWERS BLOOM: A World War II Story of Valor and Forgiveness Across Generations,” which includes the story of US Marine veteran Marty Connor described here. On a humid day in early spring, Jessamyn Harter shouldered a weathered canvas backpack and set out toward a 550-foot (168-meter) mountain on a speck of island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. She didn’t have much time, but she was on a mission of her own. In honor of her grandfather, she was going to make every second count on Iwo Jima. It was the only day this year that American citizens could visit the island, reserved for a select few as part of a tour that originates from the US territory of Guam. Returned by the US to Japan in 1968, and eventually renamed Iwo-To (Iō-Tō) in 2007, Iwo Jima (which means “sulfur island” in Japanese) was the site of one of World War II’s most important — and bloody — battles. On February 19, 1945, 70,000 members of the 4th and 5th US Marine Divisions, with the 3rd Division eventually being called in for backup, stormed the black volcanic beaches of Iwo Jima in what would become a 36-day battle with Imperial Japanese forces tasked with defending the island and its airstrips. Only around 750 miles from mainland Japan, Iwo Jima was viewed as a crucial piece of the war effort in the Pacific — and imagery from the battle would become iconic symbols, including the US Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. Among the US Marines Corps (USMC) members landing on Iwo that day was an 18-year-old named Marty Connor. He was from Syracuse, New York, and Iwo would be his first real combat. He would survive the full 36 days of the battle, and go on to run an insurance business, get married and start a family. He would also become Jessamyn Harter’s grandfather. As much as the battle of Iwo Jima shaped Connor’s life, it’s what happened after that would be his greatest legacy. A half-century mission of peace In 1970, Connor returned to the island alongside his wife and some 30 other Marines for what would eventually become known as a Reunion of Honor, a tradition that continues today. On top of Mount Suribachi, where the flag raising immortalized in Joe Rosenthal’s iconic photograph took place in 1945, Connor and his fellow Marines shook hands with Japanese veterans of the battle. The former bitter enemies showed respect to one another, and it’s also where Connor first learned of a grassroots movement to return “souvenirs” taken from the bodies of dead enemy soldiers in the Pacific, back to the families of the original owners in Japan. Connor watched with interest that day in 1970 as a Marine returned souvenirs to a Japanese family — because he had souvenirs of his own back home. Twenty-five years after the battle, he finally knew what he should do with them. Connor went back to central New York and packed up some of his own souvenirs, sending them to a former Imperial Naval captain-turned-Buddhist monk he met during the reunion named Tsunezō Wachi, who was searching for identifiable markings on these objects to track down surviving family. Many of those families in Japan had little to no information on how, where and when their loved ones had died. Having a piece of their ancestors, such as a Japanese battle flag or personal diary, meant their departed souls could finally be at rest. Related article
      80 years after World War II, Okinawa’s battle sites are still giving up bones and bombs Wachi was able to return Connor’s initial souvenirs to the families. Inspired, Connor began spreading the word through the USMC veteran community across America, at reunion events and in USMC publications, and soon packages began arriving to his home in Syracuse. For more than 40 years, he shipped objects back to where they belonged. “When I was younger, I just remember seeing Japanese flags and stuff in his office, (but) I wasn’t really aware of what he was doing and what was going on,” Harter, 43, said. “But you’d see the letters written to him in Japanese and I guess I didn’t really understand it until later on, when I was able to kind of grasp what a huge impact and a huge offering of peace between the two countries. And what makes me even more proud of my grandfather, is that he can do that. And he did that for 40-plus years.” Returning to Iwo Jima It was a long, tough day that began at 3:30 a.m. in Guam on Saturday, March 29. The United Airlines charter flight, organized by the Iwo Jima Association of America and a tour company called Military Historical Tours, in partnership with the USMC and Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, flew more than 100 passengers from Guam’s airport an hour and a half to the hangar on Iwo Jima. From her window seat, Harter marveled at how small the island looked — “you could almost pinch it between your fingers,” she said. “It was just a very tiny island for such a brutal battle.” Not only was it small, it was surprisingly green, Harter added, a stark contrast to the barren landscape immortalized in photos and video from the battle. In the 80 years since the bombardment, nature had been busy reclaiming Iwo Jima. If Harter wanted to climb to the top of Mount Suribachi and step on the famed landing beaches, she had just around five hours to cover a distance of roughly 10 miles (16 kilometers) — on foot. She also had to make a choice: she couldn’t visit both landmarks and attend the Reunion of Honor, which this year included both the sitting US secretary of defense and Japanese defense minster for the first time, as well as Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba. Harter chose Suribachi and the beach, she said, “because the first Reunion of Honor that my grandfather (attended), took place on the top of Mount Suribachi.” When she reached the top (after many pleas to her grandfather to “help me get to the top of this”), Harter found herself in tears. She carried objects from her grandfather, including the original canvas pack that he had carried during the battle’s full 36 days — now it has spent 37 days on Iwo, she said with a smile — one of his 5th Marine Division patches, and the small prayer book he kept in his uniform pocket. Harter also made it to one of the landing beaches, sitting on the hot, rocky, black volcanic sand and reflecting on what had happened there. “I feel like I have been given a gift that not a lot of people are given,” she said the next day back on Guam. “And honestly … as soon as I stepped on to the beach, I did not feel worthy. I didn’t feel like I deserved to be there. I think that every USMC veteran deserves to step onto that island. That’s their heritage. That’s their foundation.” A battle flag returns home after 80 years It was not the only grandfather-granddaughter story that day. Charles Cram, a Navy corpsman who landed with the 5th Marine Divison on Iwo Jima, was there in person with his granddaughter, Holly Cram, 42. It was the first time Charles Cram, who turned 99 two weeks before the reunion, had been back since the war. “It looked completely different,” he told CNN. At the Reunion of Honor, Cram — who was shot in the leg during the battle and later awarded the Purple Heart and Silver Star — handed over a Japanese battle flag he’d taken during the war. “He had taken a flag off of a Japanese soldier in one of the caves, and he’s had that for 80 years, and he basically was like ‘what am I going to do with it? I don’t want to keep it. I don’t know why I took it, but I want to give it back,’” his granddaughter Holly Cram told CNN in Guam. “And so I made sure I had it with me, and I kept asking him, to make sure, because I didn’t want to force him to do something he didn’t want to do. But he kept always saying, ‘yeah, that’s what I want to do.’ So I was able to (help him give it back) after the ceremony.” Related article
      What it’s like inside the secret World War II tunnels set to become a huge new tourist attraction Among the delegation to receive it was Yoshitaka Shindo, the grandson of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, who commanded Japan’s forces on Iwo Jima during the battle. “I think it’s really incredibly special to see him give that back because it was never his heart to have a souvenir or have something that would make the Japanese feel bad … I think he realizes that was somebody’s family member’s flag, and there’s no reason for me to keep this, and I want to give it back,” Holly Cram added. “It’s beautiful to see both of our countries have that type of relationship now. There’s no other place on Earth where there was a fight of that magnitude where both countries come back and experience the holy ground of it.” That’s the legacy that Harter wants people to know about, too, in honor of her own grandfather Marty Connor, but also all those who’ve made that same choice — like Cram — to see former enemies as fellow humans with loved ones of their own. “It is such a beautiful act of love and forgiveness. Because (for) both sides, it was a bitter, bitter war and so many lives were lost. And to be able to forgive your enemy and to find compassion, to give them closure is something a lot of us probably can’t do or won’t do,” Harter said. But her grandfather did. “His character, his kindness, his heart … He truly is my hero.”",,0.2564542293548584
"Many travelers associate tourist information centers with maps and help finding a nearby public bathroom. But Tammy Mermelstein counts her visits to tourist info booths as some of the highlights of her recent holiday in Japan. The Houston-based mom of two spent more than a year planning her family’s three-week trip to Japan. Though she came back with some special souvenirs — like scraps from a kimono found in a flea market and turned into wall art — she loves showing off the book of stamps she collected from traveler information centers and other tourist attractions around the country. In some parts of Europe, the tourist information booth is becoming a thing of the past. Paris said adieu to its last remaining tourist information center, next to the Eiffel Tower, in January. Scotland has announced that all of its will shut by the end of 2025. Tourism officials in both destinations cited social media and widespread access to smartphones as a reason for shutting down physical offices. Both tourism bodies have switched to a “digital first” model, shifting their focus to Instagram and TikTok as well as setting up dedicated WhatsApp channels for travelers who have specific questions. But while some industry insiders are already writing obituaries for in-person tourist support centers, destinations around Asia are actually increasing the number of traveler help desks. Related article
      Closed doors and price hikes: Travel is getting expensive Xiang Li, director of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, says that Asia’s tourist information centers are thriving because of the different mindsets of travelers in the region. “Asian tourists generally value structured guidance and interpersonal explanations,” he tells CNN Travel. “Many of these travelers are less experienced with international travel and have language barriers, making face-to-face interactions and assistance particularly important to them. “In contrast, European tourists are more accustomed to self-guided experiences, often utilizing a variety of online and offline tools, including apps and printed materials.” South Korea had about 300 tourist information centers in 2015. Now, there are 638. That number includes employees called “Moving Tourist Info Centers,” who stand around on the street in busy neighborhoods like Seoul’s Myeongdong — home to myriad shops for skincare products and Instagrammable cafes — to field questions. These staffers wear bright red shirts and cowboy hats and can speak Chinese, Japanese or English. “Visitor centers in Asia prioritize interaction and service as their most important aspects, aiming to meet the needs of tourists within a collectivist culture,” says Xiang. “In contrast, European visitor centers focus on information and education as their primary functions, catering to tourists in a context that emphasizes individual attention.” And South Korea isn’t the only Asian country where tourist information centers are booming. Japan opened 250 more between 2018 and 2024, citing overtourism as well as the need to address travelers in more languages. The government recently stated a goal of reaching 60 million tourists per year by 2030. Beyond translation and basic questions about how to find the closest public bathroom, Japan’s tourist support centers are also attractions in their own right. Each center in Japan has its own unique stamp, called an eki sutanpu in Japanese. Travelers who collect the stamps in their tourist passports will go out of their way to stop by an information booth, even if they don’t need help finding anything. These stamps are free souvenirs that pay homage to Japan’s culture of art, with travel Youtubers and Tiktokers even comparing notes on which ones are the prettiest or hardest to find. In addition to tourist information booths, these stamps are also available at major tourist attractions like temples and lookout points, plus each JR Railway train station. This collecting craze is called “stamp rallying” in English. Thai entrepreneur Patrick Pakanan says he initially founded the StampQuest app for his wife, a longtime rally-er. Pakanan spent part of his childhood in Japan and speaks the language fluently, but he never misses a chance to stop into a tourist information center. “It’s good to start to have a conversation with the local people, too, like what to eat, what is famous here, maybe visit a store that they recommend,” he says. “They’ve lived here all their lives, and they really want to help you understand their community.” Mermelstein, the Houston mom, agrees. Although she visited tourist info booths to get her stamps and ask for advice, her family ended up spending as much time in them as they would a museum. In one, she says, a staffer showed her daughters how to write their names in Japanese; in another, a woman brought out kimonos for her girls to wear and took photos of them. Some centers have dedicated play areas for younger kids. Even though Pakanan doesn’t collect stamps himself, he heads straight to a tourist information office whenever he visits a new region of Japan. “Wherever you go scuba diving, you have to have a dive master, right? Well, this is the local dive master.” Editor’s Note: CNN’s Gawon Bae and Chris Lau contributed reporting.",,0.24966755509376526
"Don’t freak out when you try to board a flight to this southwestern Japanese prefecture and the destination on the ticket says “Hello Kitty” — you’re definitely on the right plane. Oita, a scenic region known for its natural hot springs on the Japanese island of Kyushu, has recently renamed its air hub Oita Hello Kitty Airport to lure fans and tourists. The six-month rebrand, which runs from now through October 13, will inject the otherwise sleepy airport with an extra dose of the country’s quintessential cuteness — or “kawaii” in Japanese. As expected, Hello Kitty (who is, by the way, not a cat) is everywhere. Arriving passengers peeking through plane windows will get their first greetings from the Japanese character painted on the boarding bridge. As they make their way to the luggage conveyor belt, they will see posters of Hello Kitty dragging a suitcase and riding on a miniature plane. The rebranding rides on the hype of Osaka Expo 2025 and seeks to offer an alternative destination to the already congested ones, as Japan grapples with record numbers of tourists. The tourism boom — which hit a record-breaking 10.5 million in the first three months of 2025 — has given the world’s fourth-biggest economy a needed kick but also created headaches for locals. “We hope to encourage more tourists, particularly those who typically visit high-traffic destinations like Tokyo and Kyoto, to travel to Oita instead,” a spokesman from Oita Prefectural Government’s tourism bureau told CNN on Thursday. Oita is about one hour away from Osaka by plane and four hours by train. Joining Hello Kitty at the Oita airport are friends like My Melody, Little Twin Stars and Pochacco. All are characters from Sanrio, the merchandising company behind her universe of cuteness. Why Oita, though? Sanrio runs a theme park called Harmonyland in the prefecture. The company will be selling exclusive Hello Kitty key chains and T-shirts at the domestic terminal. “In addition to attracting visitors not only from major metropolitan areas such as the Tokyo and Kansai regions but also by highlighting the unique appeal of Oita Prefecture and Kyushu such as hot springs, nature, and cuisine, we aim to leverage the global popularity of Japan’s Sanrio characters and their theme park,” Sanrio said in a statement. Related article
      The ‘Shinkansen kiss’: Japan’s little-known rail spectacle that attracts trainspotters from around the world “We are filled with the hope that this airport will become a bridge connecting countless smiles,” Sanrio Entertainment President Aya Komaki said during a recent launch, before touting Hello Kitty’s slogan written on a flag she holds in posters at the airport: “Hello from Oita to the world.” Oita prefecture sits about 40 miles southeast of Fukuoka, Kyushu’s biggest city, and is home to some of Japan’s most sought-after onsen towns, like Beppu and Yufuin. It’s more popular among local tourists than international visitors, though. Almost 80% of 530,033 visitors recorded last month were domestic travelers. The airport operates mainly domestic flights, but also runs a few international routes to Seoul in South Korea and Taipei in Taiwan. It is not the first airport to name itself after the nation’s much-worshipped cartoon characters, with Japanese manga and anime being among the country’s most influential exports. In the central city of Tottori, officials renamed its airport Tottori Sand Dunes Conan Airport in 2015 to pay tribute to “Case Closed,” a Japanese manga and anime series about a child detective, Conan, who battles criminals with cool gadgets a la James Bond. The neighboring Yonago Kitaro Airport also took its name from another manga and anime series, “GeGeGe no Kitaro,” which follows the quest of a young boy named Kitaro who fights off demons — or yokai in Japanese — to protect humans. Other airports have also featured popular characters from Super Mario Bros and Pokemon in their tourism campaigns, even though they weren’t down for a name change. The country with one of the most complex train networks in the world also puts its favorite characters on trains, including — guess who — Hello Kitty.",,0.3082679212093353
"India has emerged as a growing player in the illicit fentanyl trade, a new US intelligence report says, a designation likely to raise alarm in New Delhi as President Donald Trump wields tariffs on countries he accuses of not doing enough to stop the deadly drug from flowing into the United States. Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that can be 100 times more potent than morphine, is the most common drug involved in overdose deaths in the US – fueling an opioid crisis that has become a high-priority issue for the Trump administration. For many years, China has been the largest source of both legal supplies of the drug – which is prescribed for severe pain relief – and illicit supplies of precursor chemicals that are typically processed in labs in Mexico before the final product is smuggled across the US border. But India’s role in the illegal trade is becoming more prominent, according to the 2025 Annual Threat Assessment (ATA) report published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence this month. “Nonstate groups are often enabled, both directly and indirectly, by state actors, such as China and India as sources of precursors and equipment for drug traffickers,” the report said. “China remains the primary source country for illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment, followed by India.” Last year’s ATA report named India as among countries other than China where Mexican cartels were sourcing precursor chemicals to a “lesser extent.” The 2023 report made no mention of India in relation to fentanyl. India is a global leader in generic drug manufacturing, supplying a significant portion of the world’s vaccines and medicines. It has a pharmaceutical industry so large, it is often referred to as the “Pharmacy of the World.” But the industry has been marred by controversy, raising concerns about regulation and quality control. On March 17, India’s Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) in the western state of Gujarat said it had arrested two people linked to Surat-based pharmaceutical companies for allegedly exporting illicit fentanyl precursors to Mexico and Guatemala, according to the Press Trust of India. CNN has reached out to the ATS. Days later, the US Department of Justice indicted three top executives from a Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company for allegedly importing ingredients used to make illicit fentanyl. New Delhi has not publicly spoken about the ATA report. CNN has contacted India’s Ministry of External Affairs for a response. The report comes at a delicate time for India as it mounts a case to avoid US tariffs. The US was India’s largest trading partner in 2024, accounting for almost $120 billion in trade, yet India only ranked tenth in the list of US trading partners for the same year. Indian economist and researcher Soumya Bhowmik said the ATA report “may introduce complexities in India-US relations,” and could “open the door for tougher rhetoric and potentially even targeted tariffs.” Earlier this month, the Trump administration enacted tariffs against the US’ top three trading partners: China, Mexico and Canada, saying the levies of up to 25% were necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl into the US. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington in February, where he spoke with Trump about a range of issues from defense and technology to trade and economic growth. The two leaders “resolved to expand trade and investment to make their citizens more prosperous, nations stronger, economies more innovative and supply chains more resilient,” a joint statement from that meeting said. A Washington delegation is currently in New Delhi for trade talks. India has “proactively undertaken measures to respond to potential trade tensions and mitigate the impact of impending US tariffs,” said Bhowmik, including a proposal to remove import duties on goods essential for manufacturing. The ATA report also “highlights the critical importance of collaborative efforts between (the US and India) to address the global opioid crisis,” Bhowmik said.",,0.2251276820898056
"A prominent Indian comedian is standing by his right to make jokes after an angry mob attacked a comedy club where he had made an onstage jibe at a right-wing politician. Kunal Kamra, known for his quips about popular culture and politics, is under investigation for alleged defamation by police in the western state of Maharashtra after he told a joke about the state’s Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. The case is the latest to underscore the country’s declining freedoms and the sensitivities of India’s right-wing politicians, some of whom have called for the artist’s arrest. A video of the skit, posted to Kamra’s YouTube channel Sunday, shows the comedian apparently taking a jibe at Shinde. In the video, Kamra does not explicitly name the politician but, in a song, refers to a “gaddar,” or “traitor” – taken to be a reference to Shinde’s leadership of a rebellion in 2022 that caused the state’s previous government to collapse. The joke sparked a furious backlash within Shinde’s Hindu supremacist Shiv Sena political party. An angry mob later descended upon The Habitat comedy venue where Kamra had performed in Mumbai. A video of the incident shows dozens of men – some wearing scarves with the Shiv Sena logo – smashing chairs and ripping the venue’s interior apart. Police are also investigating the alleged vandalism. CNN has contacted Shinde for comment. Shiv Sena spokesperson Krishna Hegde said Kamra’s words “insulted” the people of Maharashtra. “Mumbai police should take Kunal Kamra into custody, arrest him, lock him up behind bars and open a case against him,” he said in a video statement. Another party lawmaker, Naresh Mhaske, warned that Kamra would be unable to walk in public. “Let alone Maharashtra, you won’t be able to roam around in all of India,” he said in a video statement. Kamra has said he will not apologize for his comments and, in a post on X, criticized the “inability to take a joke at the expense of a powerful public figure.” “As far as I know, it is not against the law to poke fun at our leaders and the circus that is our political system,” he wrote. “I don’t fear this mob and I will not be hiding under my bed waiting for this to die down.” Some opposition politicians in Maharashtra have rallied to Kamra’s defense in light of the political storm. Shinde’s former political ally Aditya Thackeray said: “Only an insecure coward would react to a song by someone.” The Habitat said it was “shocked, worried and extremely broken by the vandalism,” and would be temporarily shutting down the comedy club. “We have never been involved in the content performed by any artist but the recent events have made us rethink about how we get blamed and targeted,” it said on Instagram, adding that the venue would be closed “till we figure out the best way to provide a platform for free expression without putting ourselves and our property in jeopardy.” Growing intolerance This isn’t Kamra’s first run in with the law. In December 2020, the Supreme Court held him in contempt of court for allegedly disparaging the judiciary and judges in his social media posts. In one Twitter post, he criticized the court’s handling of a case involving a right-wing commentator. Speaking to CNN two years later, Kamra labeled India a “humorless society” and said he had canceled about 100 shows because of threats by right-wing groups to the venue and audience. Freedom of speech is enshrined in India’s democratic constitution, but comedians in the world’s largest democracy have previously faced the wrath of angry politicians for their jokes. In November 2021, right-wing politicians called for comedian Vir Das’ arrest after he gave a powerful monologue addressing the country’s rape crisis and then-year-long farmer’s protest. Related article
      In India, comedians can face arrest for making the wrong kind of jokes At the time, Ashutosh Dubey, a legal adviser to India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, accused Das of “defaming” India and filed a complaint with the police over his “inflammatory” comments. Das has not been formally charged with any crime and continues to perform. But others who have faced similar situations have had their livelihoods upended. Up-and-coming comedian Nalin Yadav was imprisoned in 2021 for allegedly organizing and opening a show for a Muslim comic who was accused of telling jokes that insulted the majority Hindu faith. Yadav told CNN he was released after spending 57 days in prison, when his brother paid more than $1,300 in bail. Kamra, meanwhile, said the new investigation into his comments “does not change the nature of his right” to make fun of politicians.",,0.36989903450012207
"Excitement is growing in cinema-mad India for the return of a movie star from Pakistan to its big screens after his long absence due to an industry ban on artists from the neighboring country. Fawad Khan, an actor, singer and producer with a huge following in India, announced his Bollywood comeback last week, sending fans into a frenzy, 18 months after an Indian court effectively ruled that a de facto industry ban on Pakistani talent imposed in 2016 was illegal. “The wait is over! Bringing love back to the big screen,” Khan posted to Instagram last week, alongside a short teaser for the May 9 release of rom-com “Abir Gulaal.” The post set off a wave of excitement among fans on social media and on the streets of Mumbai, the home of Bollywood. “Super stoked to have an artist as talented as Fawad Khan back in Indian cinema,” said marketing professional Phhagun Dev. “You have been missed.” Manya Shiksharthi agreed. “Art has the power to cross borders and connect people in ways nothing else can so hoping for the absolute best,” she said. India’s multibillion-dollar movie industry produces around 1,500 to 2,000 films per year in more than 20 languages – more than any other country – and holds an outsized influence on the country’s culture, identity and economy. While Pakistani and Indian performers have a long and storied history of collaboration, that came to an abrupt halt nine years ago after dozens of Indian soldiers were killed in a militant attack in the disputed Kashmir region that was followed by deadly clashes along the contested border. India blamed Pakistan for the attack, which Islamabad denied, and as tensions escalated between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association imposed a de-facto ban on Pakistani talent. Khan, the star of multiple hit Bollywood films, simply disappeared from Indian screens. Meanwhile, Pakistan has largely restricted Indian films from release in the country since 2016. Where Hindi cinema once reflected certain secular, democratic values championed by India’s founding fathers, many critics say the industry has veered toward the right over the past decade – coinciding with the populist rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Alarmed liberals and some industry insiders point to a string of recent blockbusters that they say perpetuate anti-Muslim stereotypes and sideline opposition views. A BJP national spokesperson previously told CNN the party is not prejudiced against Muslims, and the community has benefited from Modi’s leadership. Regardless of the political climate, a pathway for stars from Muslim-majority Pakistan to return to Bollywood was opened in 2023, when the Bombay High Court rejected a petition seeking a total ban on Pakistani actors from working in India. Such a move would be “a retrograde step in promoting cultural harmony, unity and peace,” the court ruled. Yet in Khan’s home country, the film is not expected to release, upsetting fans and cinema lovers alike. “As a fan of Pakistani dramas and Hindi cinema, I for one will be disappointed to miss out on the experience of watching this creative collaboration, starring one of our most celebrated superstars,” said Lahore-based freelance journalist and communications expert Abbas Hussain. ‘Heartening news’ not welcomed by all Once a single nation, India and Pakistan were hastily divided by their departing British colonial ruler along religious lines with devastating results, giving rise to one of the world’s fiercest geopolitical rivalries. In the nearly eight decades since, the two countries have fought three wars and introduced heavy restrictions on travel and exchanges of goods, despite sharing a border, a culture and a deeply intertwined history. Among that shared culture is a nearly universal love for cinema. Khan’s new movie “Abir Gulaal” references the Hindu festival of colors Holi in its title. Set in London, it tells “a love story filled with unexpected turns,” according to its synopsis. In the teaser, Khan serenades Indian actor Vaani Kapoor to the tune of a popular Hindi love song. “Abir Singh, are you flirting?” she asks Khan. “Do you want me to?” he replies. Khan’s impending return to Bollywood is “heartening news,” Indian film critic and analyst Tanul Thakur said. Related article
      A ‘tidal change’ in Bollywood: How the world’s largest film industry veered to the right during the Modi era “It also reminds us what art can truly achieve: collapsing national boundaries, bringing people closer, and giving the fans a reason to smile,” he said. Anisha Pal, 26, a movie fan and marketing professional from Kolkata, echoed that sentiment. “I am extremely happy to see him back in Bollywood,” she said. “Art and artists shouldn’t get affected by politics. I think his return sends out a message of hope.” But not everyone is happy. Politicians from India’s Hindu-nationalist far right blasted the news of Khan’s return and have vowed to derail his film’s release. “Despite saying so many times that films by Pakistani artists will not be released in India, some nasty people still try to push their agenda,” the president of the cinema wing of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), a regional party in Bollywood’s home state, wrote on X last week. “We will not let the film release in India and that’s final. Those who want to support Pakistani artists are free to do so, but just remember that you will have to face us.” Neither Khan, nor the movie’s producers, have publicly commented on the perceived threats. CNN is attempting to reach them for comment. This isn’t the first time Khan has faced the wrath of India’s Hindu right. In 2022, his movie “The Legend of Maula Jatt” – Pakistan’s highest grossing film of all time – was banned from release in India following threats from the far-right. “The amount of business this film has done and the kind of boundaries it’s pushed… is going to have a profound effect in the years to come and I hope it continues like that,”  Khan told CNN at the time. Despite the hostility of right-wing politicians, many Indian fans say they are open to seeing more Pakistani stars on their screens. “They have been loved by the Indian audience too,” said Tania Rao, a teacher from Delhi. “Talent should be appreciated and seen beyond boundaries… I’m excited to see a good actor given a good film, and more hopeful if it aids to sooth the tension that always seems to exist between India and Pakistan.” CNN’s Esha Mitra and Deepak Rao in New Delhi and Sophia Saifi in Islamabad contributed reporting.",,0.3159986734390259
"DHL Express, a division of Germany’s Deutsche Post, said it would suspend global business-to-consumer shipments worth over $800 to individuals in the United States from April 21, as US customs regulatory changes have lengthened clearance. The notice on the company website was not dated, but its metadata showed it was compiled on Saturday. DHL blamed the halt on new US customs rules which require formal entry processing on all shipments worth over $800. The minimum had been $2,500 until a change on April 5. DHL said business-to-business shipments would not be suspended but could face delays. Shipments under $800 to either businesses or consumers were not affected by the changes. The move is a temporary measure, the company said in its statement. DHL said last week in response to Reuters questions that it would continue to process shipments from Hong Kong to the United States “in accordance with the applicable customs rules and regulations” and would “work with our customers to help them understand and adapt to the changes that are planned for May 2.” That came after Hongkong Post said last week it had suspended mail services for goods sent by sea to the United States, accusing the US of “bullying” after Washington canceled tariff-free trade provisions for packages from China and Hong Kong.",,0.2146282196044922
"Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, homegrown companies that would seem to be exactly what President Donald Trump aims to protect as part of his “America First” trade agenda. But for many small business owners, the years of hard work and the optimistic outlooks have unraveled seemingly overnight. The first week of April marked the culmination of two years’ work for Katharine Burke: The very first line of her self-care Purryfuls products went into production. However, the first week of April also brought massive tariffs for imported goods from China, where Burke’s products are made. Melanie Abrantes, now 11 years in at running her eponymous handcrafted product design company, has found herself in need of ordering more artisan tools, cork and other raw materials to support the steadily growing subscription carving club. But an uncertain and frequently changing tariff environment means sudden price hikes for the unique items that come from places like Japan and Portugal. For Busy Baby owner Beth Fynbo Benike, 2025 was stacking up to be a growth-spurt year for the business she started in 2017. The Army veteran’s baby products company got its foot in the door at Walmart and Target, and she just placed her largest-ever order to replenish inventory for her website and Amazon. That container of goods, however, now will cost her nearly $230,000 to arrive on US soil. The erratic nature of President Donald Trump’s trade policies and the severity of newly imposed tariffs have wreaked havoc on small businesses in the US, causing costs to quickly skyrocket, unsettling longstanding supply chains, swiftly stifling growth and expansion plans — and threatening to kill American-bred businesses. “I’m fully leveraged against this, and the first thought that came to my head is, ‘I’m going to lose my house. My boys are not going to have a place to live,’” Benike said. These and other small businesses say they’re caught in the crossfire of escalating trade wars. And despite the trio’s efforts to manufacture their products in the US, they’ve instead had to rely on imported goods because the ability to source and produce domestically is not feasible and, in many cases, nonexistent. “I tried for American manufacturing because I thought it would be easier on me to work with somebody local, but it didn’t exist — it hasn’t for decades,” said Burke, who ultimately turned to a China-based manufacturer to help design, test and manufacture her purring cat self-care plushies for adults. “[China is] where the investment has been for decades in terms of building plans and equipment and training a workforce. That’s where the industry is; it doesn’t change overnight, no matter how much you want it to.” Canaries in the coal mine Economists have warned that the sharpest escalation in the US tariff rate in more than 115 years comes with cascading negative economic consequences, including higher costs, rising inflation and gashed earnings that may lead to a pullback in spending that could cause businesses to fail, unemployment to rise and a recession to grip the US. America’s small businesses could be the canaries in the coal mine. They face the greatest immediate risk from the tariffs, Gus Faucher, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN. Small businesses typically have minimal wiggle room in their margins and can’t simply eat the added costs like the big guys can. Capital isn’t as easy to come by, making small businesses more vulnerable and susceptible to exogenous threats. “If you’re Walmart, you may be able to tell your supplier to hold the line on price increases,” he said. “But if you’re a small business owner, you don’t have that leverage.” If small businesses start buckling, it could create a “significant economic drag,” Faucher warned. That’s because small businesses with fewer than 50 workers employ nearly half of the American labor force and serve as critical drivers of employment economic growth. “These small businesses are going to cut back on their investments and that can create a significant economic drag and add to the downdraft that the tariffs are already creating,” he said. “It means that economic growth is going to be weaker. It means that the unemployment rate will be higher, inflation will be higher. Consumers will be less well off than they would have been before the tariffs.” Headwinds for a brand new business Burke has spent the past two years building her business and creating Purryfuls, a purring plushie that’s intended to help stressed-out Millennials and Gen Zers. The business itself was born out of a stressful situation: Burke, working in the high-pressure tech industry, found herself on the brink of burnout and in need of calm. She turned to her cat, Wren, for comfort, but the 4-year-old Siamese tabby’s emotional support is not on demand. So she decided to create a self-care product instead (basing the design on Wren) and last month launched Purryfuls at the New York Toy Fair. After landing some acclaim and a slew of pre-orders, Burke pulled the trigger on the production. The first line of Purryfuls was being crafted the same week that Trump’s massive “Liberation Day” tariffs were implemented — and duties on Chinese imports quickly skyrocketed to 145%. “It went from 0% to 20%, and I think the next one was 80% and then 125% and now, 145%,” she said. “As I’m watching the news, I’m also seeing tariffs spring up and then get paused or put aside and then they come back. It’s not possible, really, for a business to adjust that quickly, particularly a small business like me.” Burke said she’s worried that the tariffs could shut down her business before it even gets going. However, she said, while Purryfuls might be the “smallest of small businesses, I have no intention of going down without a fight.” Burke said she has no option but to move full steam ahead and hope for the best — even though she doesn’t yet know how much more she’ll have to shell out when her 1,000 Purryfuls units land at the Port of Los Angeles. “I’m not ready to give up on something I’ve been working two years on when, who knows, it could change in a couple of hours or a couple of days,” she said. “I’m hoping it changes in a couple of weeks, because that’s when [the Purryfuls] come in.” ‘So chaotic. It changes every day’ When Trump announced a 90-day pause on the steep and varying “reciprocal” tariffs for dozens of US trading partners (while keeping in place a 10% across-the-board tariff), that gave a slight reprieve for Abrantes, an Oakland, California-based designer who imports carving tools from Japanese artisans and raw materials from countries like Portugal, where cork is plentiful. “I’m half-Portuguese, so I wanted to have a direct connection to my own heritage and my own experience and use a material that said a lot about my own story,” she said. However, the materials that helped set Melanie Abrantes Designs apart from other firms could soon come at an even bigger premium. Related article
      In China’s ‘Christmas Town,’ Trump’s tariffs are dimming the lights “I’ve been trying to expedite as many orders as possible to get them through within that 90-day window,” she said. “Still, there’s definitely a lingering sense of uncertainty.” And costs are already starting to rise for the business, she said, noting that her US-based packaging supplier sources some materials from China and has had to raise prices. Abrantes has yet to do so herself, although she recently posted a warning on Instagram that she’d have to pass along any costs from the larger tariffs. “It’s been so chaotic; it changes every day, and it feels like I can’t really keep up with it,” she told CNN. “So it’s been tough to be able to plan for this.” “I want to invest in my business and in my future, but it feels so unknown, and it’s hard to make decisions on what to do if you’re not sure what’s going to happen.” ‘We don’t feel supported as a small business’ Everything seemed to be falling into place for Busy Baby, a company that specializes in products that keep babies’ items from falling on the floor. In the fall of 2024, the Oronoco, Minnesota-based company inked deals with Target and Walmart to sell tethered baby place mats and other accessories at 250 stores across the US. And as those sales gained traction, and to help supplement what Busy Baby sells on its own website and on those such as Amazon, Benike ordered a containerful of product from her longtime manufacturer in China. However, as of Friday, that $158,000 order (which has been already paid for) is sitting in her manufacturer’s warehouse 7,500 miles away. That’s because if it were to get shipped to the US, Busy Baby would have to pay an additional $229,100 to cover the 145% tariff expense. Benike launched a crowdfunding campaign to help her try to cover the cost. The concerns extend well beyond the near term, she said. The Walmart and Target contracts were signed when tariffs were 0% and the terms include locked-in pricing. Also, the container in waiting is for summer inventory. The next Busy Baby order would be for the critical holiday season. “I’m afraid to start my production for [the fourth quarter], which is what we would normally be doing right now,” she said. “About 40% of our annual sales come during [the fourth quarter], and in order to fufill those orders, we need to start production now.” But the situation is far too untenable to make that determination, she said, adding that she’s exploring all options including shifting her sales to countries outside of the US. She’s also reaching out to members of Congress to share the plight of her business and other small operations, which she feels have been cast aside, especially as exemptions were made for smartphone, electronics and computers — products critical to the bottom line of Big Tech firms, including those not founded in America. “We don’t feel supported as small businesses by our government,” she said. “But for me, an Army veteran, a small American business, I’m at risk of going out of business completely because the tariffs are so high that I can’t possibly afford to bring my products into the country to sell them.”",,0.27661019563674927
"Editor’s Note: This article contains graphic images and descriptions. Christine Pascual’s phone started buzzing while she was at work in a hair salon with messages saying former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was about to be arrested. “I started crying, both out of relief and sorrow, the entire day and all through the night,” Pascual told CNN. The news brought memories of her late son Joshua Pascual Laxamana flooding back. Laxamana, a 17-year-old with dreams of becoming an online gamer, went missing in August 2018 on his way home from a gaming tournament in the northern Philippines. “His friends who went with him said they were short on money, so they split ways,” his mother recalled. With no word from him in days, she started her own search for her son. “I started looking for him at every computer shop around our area, thinking he was close to home.” A week later, a letter from the police arrived. It said her son was dead. She was taken to the morgue and greeted by a sight she had never imagined; her son’s body pierced by six gunshots and covered in bruises. “When he was young, I’d worried about him being bitten by flies,” she said. There is another image she will never forget; a photograph the police showed her of Laxamana’s lifeless body on the street where he was gunned down. She remembers his eyes were still wide open. Pascual said the officers told her he was killed because “he tried to fight back.” According to a Philippine Inquirer report, Rosales Municipal Police claimed Laxamana was on a motorbike, ignored a police checkpoint, then fired at officers. “They accused him of horrible, unimaginable things,” said Pascual – who denies her son was a drug dealer and said he didn’t know how to ride a motorbike. Pascual is determined to seek justice. With the help of NGOs, she requested a second autopsy and raised money for his funeral. She has also recounted her testimony at senate hearings and public investigations and continues to work with human rights groups to gather evidence for her son. She even took a case to the Philippines Supreme Court, but it was dismissed. “We will fight wherever justice takes us…,” she said, “It’s been hard for me to accept my son died without any explanation. He was accused of something and was killed just like that…I hope that can change in this country,” she said. Pascual is not alone. A long-awaited arrest Duterte’s court appearance in the International Criminal Court (ICC) last month is “a sight families of the thousands of victims of the ‘war on drugs’ in the Philippines feared they would never see,” said Amnesty International’s Southeast Asia Researcher Rachel Chhoa-Howard. “The very institution that former President Duterte mocked will now try him for murder…is a symbolic moment and a day of hope for families of victims and human rights defenders who have for years fought tirelessly for justice despite grave risks to their lives and safety.” It shows that those accused of committing the worst crimes “may one day face their day in court, regardless of their position,” Chhoa-Howard added. Duterte ran the Philippines for six turbulent years, during which he oversaw a brutal crackdown on drugs and openly threatened critics with death. In his inaugural address in 2016, he claimed there were 3.7 million “drug addicts” in the Philippines and said he would “have to slaughter these idiots for destroying my country.” The figure was more than twice the number of active drug users reported in a 2015 Philippines Dangerous Drug board (DDB) study, which said 1.8 million people – just under 2% of the population – were using drugs. By 2019, three years into the ‘war of drugs’, the DDB survey estimated 1.6 million people were taking dangerous drugs in the Philippines – an 11% decrease from 2015. Among many Filipinos, Duterte’s drug war – and his bombastic disregard for the country’s political elites – remained popular for much of his time in office. But the collateral damage caused by so many extrajudicial deaths also mounted. Many of the victims were young men from impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen as part of a campaign to target alleged dealers. According to police data, 6,000 people were killed – but rights groups say the death toll could be as high as 30,000, with innocents and bystanders often caught in the crossfire. Duterte’s tough approach on drugs prompted strong criticism from opposition lawmakers who launched a probe into the killings. Duterte in turn jailed his fiercest opponent and accused some news media and rights activists as traitors and conspirators. His blood-soaked presidency ended in 2022 but, three years on, hundreds, if not thousands, of extrajudicial killings have not been accounted for. Victims’ families are often spooked or threatened not to pursue their case in local courts, leaving hundreds in limbo with little to no due process in the Philippines. To date, only eight policemen had been convicted for five drug war deaths, according to court documents. The threat of being held to account in the ICC has been hanging over Duterte’s for almost a decade. Prosecutors first said they were watching what was happening in the Philippines in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2021 that a formal investigation was launched. For years, Duterte – along with his loyal allies and fierce supporters – argued that allegations of wrongdoing should be dealt with by the Philippine justice system, saying the involvement of foreign courts would impede the country’s judicial independence and sovereignty. As president, he even withdrew the Philippines from the ICC - which took effect in March 2019. That, however, proved to be no protection; the ICC still has jurisdiction for crimes alleged during the years the nation was a member. Last week, Duterte went from boasting about killing drug dealers to being arrested for crimes against humanity as the ICC finally caught up with him. In a dramatic arrest, the 80-year-old was outnumbered by local police when he returned to Manila from Hong Kong. After being detained for hours at an airbase, he was put on a plane bound for the Netherlands to face the ICC on charges of crimes against humanity – alleged to have been committed between 2011 and 2019. On Thursday (March 14), Duterte made his first appearance via video link at The Hague where he appeared tired and slightly uneasy. His defense lawyer, Salvador Medialdea, called the arrest a “pure and simple kidnapping.” During the hearing, Presiding Judge Iulia Motoc read Duterte his rights and set September 23 as the date for a hearing to determine whether the evidence presented by the prosecution would be sufficient to take the case to trial. Left without closure Thousands of lives have been upended by the drug war killings. They not only left devastated parents to bury their children but also left dozens of children as orphans. Eya was just 9-years-old when both her parents were shot by hooded, uniformed policemen at around three in the morning in August 2016. Now 18, she and her sister work at a coffee shop in Manila run by families of victims. Eya, who requested to go by a pseudonym for safety, told CNN she was shocked when Duterte was finally arrested. ”I hope justice will be given to us. And others responsible for the thousands of those who died will also get arrested.” Eya told CNN she hopes other police officials and officers involved in the bloody crackdown would one day also be held accountable. Cresalie Agosto was at work when her 16-year-old daughter called her in on December 1, 2016 with shocking news. ”Ma, dad has been shot. Please come back,” she heard her daughter say. Agosto rushed home. Nearby, police had cordoned off an area surrounding her husband’s body. “It was true. I saw my husband with gunshot wounds on his head, stomach and foot,” she told CNN. Matches and a small sachet containing a white power were found on the ground near him, items Agosto says she’d never seen her husband carry around. Witnesses told her they saw two motorbikes each carrying two masked men carrying big, long guns, looking for a man named “Roy”. They asked her husband, Richie Reyes, if he was “Roy”. She was told that he said he was not the man they were looking for, but they shot him anyway. “There’s nothing more that we want other than justice and accountability,” Agosto said. “When Duterte was arrested upon arrival his rights were still read aloud to him. For us, our loved ones were greeted with bullets with no explanation.” Luzviminda Siapo was away from home as migrant worker in Kuwait when tragic news that her 19-year-old son, Raymart, was killed by police in 2017. Her son was born with clubfoot deformities – a condition which can affect mobility. A witness who was sleeping in a parked jeepney in an alley told Siapo they heard police yell at Raymart to run away. “No, I cannot run. I don’t want to run,” Raymart cried out, according to the witness.  A gunshot was then heard. Luzviminda said she wants to see Duterte “rot in jail” for her son’s death. “He may be in jail, but he is alive unlike my son who died and is no longer with us. I cannot hug him anymore nor talk to him.”",,0.3517400026321411
"A Boeing jet intended for use by a Chinese airline landed back at the planemaker’s U.S. production hub on Saturday, a victim of the tit-for-tat bilateral tariffs launched by President Donald Trump in his global trade offensive. The 737 MAX, which was meant for China’s Xiamen Airlines, landed at Seattle’s Boeing Field at 6:11 p.m., according to a Reuters witness. It was painted with Xiamen livery. The jet, which made refueling stops in Guam and Hawaii on its 5,000-mile (8,000-km) return journey, was one of several 737 MAX jets waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion center for final work and delivery to a Chinese carrier. Trump this month raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%. In retaliation, China has imposed a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. A Chinese airline taking delivery of a Boeing jet could be crippled by the tariffs, given that a new 737 MAX has a market value of around $55 million, according to IBA, an aviation consultancy. It is not clear which party made the decision for the aircraft to return to the U.S. Boeing did not immediately respond to request for comment. Xiamen did not respond to request for comment.

      Boeing shares fall on report that China has halted its deliveries as part of trade war The return of the 737 MAX, Boeing’s best-selling model, is the latest sign of disruption to new aircraft deliveries from a breakdown in the aerospace industry’s decades-old duty-free status. The tariff war and apparent U-turn over deliveries comes as Boeing has been recovering from an almost five-year import freeze on 737 MAX jets and a previous round of trade tensions. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties, analysts say.",,0.2906906008720398
"As civil war-torn Myanmar struggles to recover from a devastating earthquake, the United States is facing criticism that it has abandoned the country in its hour of need – and is ceding global leadership on disaster response to its rivals. The 7.7-magnitude quake, which struck on March 28 and killed thousands, is the first major natural disaster since the Trump administration canceled billions of dollars in lifesaving programs under its drive to dismantle the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the main US humanitarian aid agency. USAID used to administer most of America’s foreign aid – 61% of the $71 billion total budget in 2023. But since taking office in January, the Trump administration has laid off thousands of its employees, and cut 83% of USAID programs – including staff and programs working to help Myanmar. On Wednesday, they also announced that all foreign staff would be laid off. Those cuts have been felt in the meager US response to the Myanmar quake, according to experts, exposing a void in international relief measures for major catastrophes. “It really shows to the average Myanmar citizen that the United States has abandoned them,” Francisco Bencosme, a former USAID senior policy adviser, told CNN. “Not only did the United States only send a paltry amount of assistance, it sent only three workers, which then subsequently were fired while they were on the ground in Myanmar providing assistance.” Those three USAID staff members were laid off last week, within days of arriving in Myanmar – receiving notices that their roles will be eliminated in the coming months – former senior USAID official Marcia Wong confirmed to CNN. At least 3,550 people died and nearly 5,000 others were injured when the earthquake hit the impoverished Southeast Asian nation – which has already endured years of civil war since a military coup in 2021, leaving nearly 20 million people in need of aid. The military government does not control all of the resource-rich country, as it battles a patchwork of powerful ethnic militias and pro-democracy groups. “The needs are massive right now,” said Matthew Smith, CEO of human rights organization Fortify Rights, based in neighboring Thailand. “And unfortunately, the aid effort is not as robust as it could or should be.” Two days after the quake, the US pledged $2 million in assistance to Myanmar – later increased to a total of $9 million – for emergency shelter, food, medical care and water, according to a post on X from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. But Smith says that with minimal staffing on the ground, it is unclear how that money would be channeled. Related article
      State Department formally notifies Congress it is effectively dissolving USAID “There’s nobody to administer that aid, there (are) no aid workers on the ground, there’s no deployment happening,” Smith said. “To so drastically cut it the way that they have was reckless and irresponsible.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the American response in Brussels last week. The US is “not the government of the world,” he said, adding that although Washington would continue to provide some humanitarian assistance, others should do more. “There are a lot of other countries in the world and everyone should pitch in,” Rubio said. “I don’t think it’s fair to assume that the United States needs to continue to share the burden (of) 60-70% of humanitarian aid around the world.” Comparisons have been made to the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria in February 2023, when the US deployed hundreds of relief workers and pledged $185 million in assistance. “In the past, the US government has certainly been one of the most effective response teams to mass-scale natural disasters,” Smith said. ‘Strategic mistake’ Multiple countries are filling the gap left by Washington’s limited earthquake response, including China, Russia and India – which have sent aid, rescue teams and mobile medical units to Myanmar. Related article
      UN expert says Myanmar imported $1 billion in arms since coup, much of it from Russia and China Tom Fletcher, the United Nations’ humanitarian affairs chief – who spent several days visiting the areas worst affected by the quake – said the world “can’t be reliant on US support alone.” “The fact that the US is cutting back heavily hits us here, as you know, it hits us everywhere,” Fletcher told CNN on Sunday from Yangon, before he departed the country. This year’s humanitarian appeal from the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has only been 7% funded – which will hamper relief efforts around the world, he added. “I’ve been in touch with China, with Russia, other countries that are moving aid in to try to ensure that we get as much global support as possible,” Fletcher said. Beyond the humanitarian impact of the US retreat on assistance, ex-USAID official Bencosme said ceding this ground to adversaries such as Beijing and Moscow is a “strategic mistake” from a soft power perspective. “Other actors will fill in that leadership void, which makes it difficult for the US to leverage international assistance or international help in the future,” Bencosme said. Smith, of Fortify Rights, said some of the countries providing help to Myanmar are also facilitating the military’s attacks on rebel-held areas, which have continued since the disaster. “It’s deeply troubling, ironic sadly, in some ways that the same countries that are providing the Myanmar military junta with weapons that the junta is using to kill civilians, those are the same countries now arriving into Myanmar to help with the aid effort,” he said. Reduced to ashes For the homeless residents of Mandalay’s Sein Pan district, in the epicenter of the earthquake zone, aid can’t come fast enough. The informal settlement of wooden shacks was built on a landfill dump, and the tremors ignited a huge fire which spread rapidly, residents said. “The fireball emerged from the ground immediately after the earthquake,” said resident Kyi Thein, as she stood on the charred remains of her home. “The fire spread out across the district and wiped out all 400 houses. Everybody ran away and now nothing remains.” “I hope the government authorities will provide aid to us,” Kyi Thein said. “We are now depending on private donors for a living, but we need support.” Another Sein Pan resident, who did not wish to share her name for security reasons, said the flames were so intense that they were unable to save any possessions. “The entire neighborhood was reduced to ashes,” she said. “I’m relieved to have survived. I just want my home back.” In the quake’s aftermath, junta leader Gen. Min Aung Hlaing made a rare request for international aid. But the UN human rights office says the military has also been using its routine strategy of blocking and controlling access to aid and humanitarian workers. Two weeks after the disaster struck, workers in the impacted areas are no longer looking for survivors - they have now switched to a recovery and aid operation. But the challenges of doing so without the support they need are growing. “We need to use proper machines to recover bodies under the collapsed buildings,” said 41-year-old Ei Mon Khine, an official from a social assistance association who was working on the scene. “When the rescuers do not arrive in time, the dead bodies become spoiled and deformed,” making it harder to recover the remains, she said.

      Smell of death lingers in town at epicenter of Myanmar quake People who have lost their homes are also dealing with temperatures of more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), along with thunderstorms that rolled through last weekend. “There was heavy wind and rain, and you have people living in tents outside on the street, so it made an already difficult situation even worse,” said Sara Netzer, Myanmar country director for the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), based in Yangon. “We need to ensure that we are already thinking about how we can build some temporary shelter for people, and that will also help prevent this spread of disease as well.” Many quake-hit communities in Mandalay and the neighboring Sagaing region were already hosting those displaced by the civil war, she added, showing the “resiliency” of Myanmar, but increasing the need for help before more heavy rains arrive. “I think it’s illustrative of the kind of race against time that we have right now, before the monsoon season starts here in Myanmar,” Netzer said.",,0.3077630400657654
"New satellite images show what could be North Korea’s biggest warship ever – possibly more than double the size of anything in leader Kim Jong Un’s naval fleet. Images taken by independent satellite providers Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs on April 6 show the ship under construction in the water at the Nampo shipyard on North Korea’s west coast, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of the capital Pyongyang. Analysts say the pictures show ongoing construction of weapons and other internal systems of the ship, which is likely a guided-missile frigate (FFG) designed to carry missiles in vertical launch tubes for use against targets on land and sea. “The FFG is approximately 140 meters (459 feet) long, making it the largest warship manufactured in North Korea,” an analysis by Joseph Bermudez Jr. and Jennifer Jun at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said. For comparison, the US Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are about 505 feet long and its under-construction Constellation-class frigates will be 496 feet long. The existence of the warship is not a surprise. The Kim regime has been engaged in a rapid modernization of its armed forces, developing a range of new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach almost anywhere in the United States. It’s done that despite United Nations sanctions that have puts strict limits on its access to the materials and technology to develop those weapons. But the closer ties with Russia since the beginning of the Ukraine war could be helping North Korea overcome the UN sanctions, analysts say. Kim Duk-ki, a retired South Korean admiral, said he thinks Moscow may be providing the technology for the frigate’s missile systems. Pictures of the vessel appeared in a report by state-run Korean Central Television released late last year on the ruling Workers’ Party’s end-of-year plenary session. The images showed leader Kim inspecting the ship’s construction. The images in the KCTV video show the warship could have the kind of weaponry possessed by modern navies, including vertical launch cells that could be used to fire a variety of missiles. Analysts also noted the ship seems to be set up to have phased-array radar, which can track threats and targets more quickly and accurately than previously displayed North Korean capabilities. Despite those indications of advanced warfighting abilities, analysts urged caution in making assumptions. The challenge of building warships Almost any shipbuilder can get the hull and propulsion systems right, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and Hawaii-based analyst. “However, modern warships represent an integration challenge of communications, electronics, weapons, and both electronic and acoustic sensor technologies” that is not so easily achieved, he said. In an interview with CNN in March, South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-kee, a member of the National Assembly’s Intelligence Committee, questioned whether Pyongyang has the technical ability to build an advanced warship, or the infrastructure to support it. “Operating such a big military warship takes significant amount of budget. They not only have to build a warship, but make a team that would operate it, and it costs to operate it including the equipment and fuel. Also, one huge warship cannot go out on its own. So the question is, can North Korea afford the cost?” he said. Kim, the retired South Korean admiral, was cautious on not underestimating what the final product may look like, especially its lethality. “If North Korea equips the new frigate with the hypersonic ballistic missile it claimed to have successfully tested in January, that will cause a game changing impact in the regional security,” the former naval officer said. After reviewing the satellite images for CNN, Schuster said it’s likely a year or more of work remains before the new North Korean warship can begin sea trials. “This ship’s construction is being delayed by the lack of the superstructure, sensor and weapons systems intended for installation,” he said. North Korea’s aged fleet North Korea’s navy has about 400 patrol combatants and 70 submarines, according to the most recent estimate from the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in a 2021 report. Though that’s a large number of vessels, most of them are old and small. Joseph Dempsey, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote in a January blog post that Pyongyang has only two principal surface combatants. Those Najin-class frigates – 1,600-ton warships dating to the early 1970s – are obsolete, he wrote. The DIA report said the North Korean navy would largely be reduced to coastal defense in any conflict with South Korea or the United States, both of which have vastly superior naval forces. But North Korean leader Kim has been pushing to modernize his naval fleet. It is also developing submarine-launched missiles and the subs to carry them. In September, Kim inspected the site for a new naval port. “Now that we are soon to possess large surface warships and submarines which cannot be anchored at the existing facilities for mooring warships, the construction of a naval base for running the latest large warships has become a pressing task,” he said at the time. Yu Yong-won, a South Korean lawmaker, said the ship under construction at the Nampo yard is only one example of Kim trying to modernize his navy. A nuclear-powered submarine is under construction at a shipyard in the North Korean port of Sinpo and another frigate or destroyer is in the works in Chongjin, Yu said.

"Beijing has warned its trading partners against succumbing to US pressure to isolate China in President Donald Trump’s tariff war, as part of its carrot-and-stick approach to win over countries caught between the world’s two largest economies. Commenting on recent media reports about the Trump administration’s plans to pressure countries into restricting trade with China in exchange for exemptions from US tariffs, a spokesperson for China’s Commerce Ministry said on Monday: “Appeasement does not bring peace, and compromise does not earn respect.” “Seeking temporary self-interest at the expense of others — in exchange for so-called exemptions — is like asking a tiger for its skin. In the end, it will achieve nothing and harm both others and oneself,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests. If such a situation arises, China will not accept it and will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures,” the spokesperson added. The stern warning comes on the heels of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s charm offensive in Southeast Asia, where he presented China as a reliable partner and staunch defender of global trade – in stark contrast to the tariff whiplash and policy uncertainty of the Trump administration. Pressure has been piling on countries and businesses alike as they try to thread the needle between the two economic superpowers, which have slapped record tariffs on each other in a swiftly escalating fight that has roiled global markets, disrupted supply chains and stoked recession fears. On April 9, Trump paused his “reciprocal” tariffs on most nations for 90 days while narrowing the focus of his historic trade war squarely on China, hiking levies on Chinese imports to a staggering 145%. Many countries are hoping to renegotiate the levies with the US before the suspension expires. In response, China retaliated by raising tariffs on US goods to 125% and adding more American companies on its export control list and unreliable entity list. Beijing also moved to exert pain on key US industries, restricting the number of Hollywood movies shown in the country and returning at least two Boeing jets intended for use by Chinese airlines to the US. With the US and China at each other’s throats on tariffs, neither leader is backing down – and both are looking to build a broad coalition of countries against the other. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Trump administration planned to use ongoing tariff negotiations to pressure US trading partners to limit their dealings with China, citing unnamed sources with knowledge of the conversations. The idea is to extract commitments from US trading partners to isolate China’s economy in exchange for reductions in trade and tariff barriers imposed by the White House, including asking nations to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from setting up in their territories to avoid US tariffs and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies, the WSJ reported.

      China urges Vietnam to resist ‘unilateral bullying’ as Xi tries to rally region in face of Trump tariffs For its part, China has sought to capitalize on the chaos and uncertainty unleashed by Trump and rally countries to its side. In his first foreign trip this year, Xi visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia last week, signing a barrage of bilateral cooperation agreements and pledging to uphold free and open trade. The three export-reliant economies were hit by US “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 49% before the levies were paused. Chinese officials have also held calls and talks with counterparts in Japan, South Korea and the European Union to push for closer economic cooperation. But while countries appear receptive to Beijing’s outreach, they are also wary of being flooded with cheap Chinese goods that are now shut out of the US markets due to the sky-high tariffs – and the risk of provoking Trump for siding with China. Beijing’s own record of economic coercion, aggressive trade practices and assertive military posturing in the region is not helping, either. Elizabeth Economy, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said despite China’s overtures, countries are not “jumping at the chance to partner with China.” “For many of these countries, even when China is a larger trading partner, the United States is often a much larger export market. So they have significant stakes with the US economy as well,” she said. And even as Xi launches his charm offensive, Beijing is not stopping its military assertiveness in the region, Economy added, citing Chinese live-fire drills in waters near Australia and New Zealand in February, ongoing aggression against Taiwan, the Philippines in the South China Sea and Japan over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. “They’re not stepping back in terms of their security ambitions even as they’re trying to promote themselves as a stabilizing economic force. So I think that charm offensive needs to be more all-embracing if Xi Jinping is actually going to realize the kinds of benefits that I think he wants from what President Trump is doing,” she said.

"Like many American manufacturers, Tesla is caught in a bind thanks to President Donald Trump’s trade war. Unlike most of those other companies, though, Tesla has an added wrinkle – its CEO, Elon Musk, sometimes called the First Buddy for the close relationship he’s cultivated with the president. On Tuesday, Tesla reports earnings; that afternoon, Musk will take questions from investors. But there is a catch-22: If Musk continues his close ties to Trump, the company could alienate potential customers, both at home and overseas, who dislike Trump’s policies. If he distances himself from Trump, though, he risks the ire of the White House. It’s a lose-lose situation, and it’s a trap of Musk’s own making. The first quarter saw the company’s largest drop in sales after virtually nonstop double-digit sales growth. But the automaker’s finances are only part of what investors will want to know. Reassuring responses on any these topics could help reverse the slide that has wiped out about half of Tesla’s share value (TSLA) since mid-December — and perhaps restore some faith in the company. Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities and longtime Tesla bull who nonetheless recently slashed his price target for Tesla shares, said Musk is facing a “code red situation” if he continues his high profile role in the Trump administration. Blaming brand damage for falling sales, Ives said in a note to clients on Sunday that “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time.” Beyond the Musk backlash, Tesla is also facing growing competition from other EV automakers, especially in China. Bad news on any of these fronts could cause a new downward spiral for the shares. “It’s turned into a nightmare for Tesla and for investors,” Ives told CNN. “The tariffs, the DOGE controversies, the brand damage — it’s been a perfect storm.” A no-win situation on tariffs In some ways, Tesla is less exposed than other automakers to Trump’s auto tariffs. It does not import cars from its two overseas factories, and it uses fewer foreign parts in its US-built vehicles than other automakers. All other major automakers also have at least some imported vehicles in their American dealerships. It has stopped taking new orders in China for its higher-priced Model S and Model X cars, which are built in California, due to China’s 125% retaliatory tariffs, but those models are only a small fraction of its overall sales. But Musk has said that the cost to Tesla will be “not trivial.” “Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” he said on his social media platform, X, the day after Trump’s auto tariff plans were announced. But too much criticism of tariffs during Tuesday’s call could harm his bromance with Trump. Musk became Trump’s largest financial donor last year and has been among his closest advisors since the inauguration. Tesla shares nearly doubled in value in the two months after the election as some investors and analysts hoped Musk would influence Trump to implement Tesla-friendly policies, most notably on self-driving vehicles. Conversely, strong support for Trump’s tariff policies could anger Chinese authorities and EV buyers. China is the world’s largest auto market and EV market, but its consumers are increasingly turning to rivals such as China’s own BYD. Tesla booked $20.9 billion in sales in 2024 in China, about 21% of its revenue, its second-largest market after the United States. Ives called China “the linchpin to the future success of Tesla.” He warned that “the backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk’s association will be hard to understate.” When will Musk leave DOGE? Protests outside Tesla showrooms and vandalism at its facilities underscore the backlash the company and its CEO are facing. Some of the most popular investor questions on Tesla’s site touch on that issue. “Did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all of the rumors of ‘brand damage’?” read one question endorsed by more than 1,000 investors. “How is the company planning to deal with the impact of Elon’s partnership with the current administration?” asked another popular investor question. Another asked: “Boycotts, protests, vandalism, negative headlines, and a stock slide have been sparked by Elon Musk’s participation in changes to U.S. gov’t services & employment. Is the Tesla board discussing whether their CEO should focus fully on Tesla and leave gov’t to elected politicians?” When Musk held an all-hands meeting for Tesla employees last month, it sparked a one-week rally in its battered shares. But the rally proved short-lived. On April 2, when Tesla reported its biggest-ever year-over-year drop in quarterly sales, shares fell sharply — until Politico ran a story later that morning that Musk would soon give up his role in the government. The news lifted shares. However, Musk and other members of the administration said the story wasn’t accurate. “Tesla’s first quarter sales and production report causes us to think that — if anything — we may have underestimated the degree of consumer reaction,” JPMorgan Chase analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about its sales or the impact that Musk’s role in the administration had on those sales. Many promises, with no progress Musk has made ambitious promises for a fleet of self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots, claiming that they will make the company the most valuable in the world. He had touted plans for a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, due to start in June. But there have been no updates. Meanwhile, Uber and Google’s own driverless car unit, Waymo, has beaten Tesla to the punch with the start of its own joint driverless taxi service in that city. “It would be a huge negative for the stock if he pushed back (the robotaxi plans),” Ives said. “We need to hear good news there, because there’s not going to be good news in terms of earnings or what the rest of the year will look like financially.”",,0.2956874370574951
"Twice a week, Nilda Rivadeneira hops on her bicycle and pedals to work. She tells CNN she wishes it were a women’s bike instead of a men’s one, but she rides it now that her son, who no longer lives at home, stopped using it. In a way, it suits her, she says: being old and inconspicuous, she blends in, which helps her as she travels through unsafe areas. Nilda works cleaning houses by the hour about two kilometers from her home in the northern part of Buenos Aires province, and by biking she saves on transportation costs. Between that job, another one that she goes to twice a week by bus, and sewing orders that she does on her own, she earns a monthly income of just under $300 (at Argentina’s informal exchange rate). In August, she will turn 60, the retirement age for women in Argentina, which would allow her to draw on another source of income. However, a measure implemented by President Javier Milei’s government will prevent her from accessing her pension. The Pension Debt Payment Plan – known as the pension moratorium – was a law passed during the administration of former President Alberto Fernández in 2023, which allowed those who did not have the required 30 years of contributions to instead pay into a plan of up to 120 installments through a direct deduction from their pension, allowing them to qualify for retirement. The moratorium was for two years, until March 2025, and extendable for two more. But in October, Argentina’s government announced that it would not be renewed. Informal work When Nilda finished high school, she started a career in teaching, but quickly had to drop out. “I got married very young and became a mother at 20. That’s why I stopped studying, had three children not too far apart in age, and had to take care of the family,” she recalls. Some time later, a fourth child arrived, but beyond the years she dedicated exclusively to raising children, Nilda calculates she’s worked for 17 years in formal jobs and almost 20 years in odd jobs and gig work. But those don’t count to the 30 years of eligible contributions required to retire by law. According to the latest official data, 36.1% of Argentines have precarious jobs, meaning their employers don’t make payments into the retirement system. And, according to a 2023 government report, the domestic employment sector — made up almost entirely of women — has much higher informality rates, close to 75%. Nilda is part of these statistics. “They tell us: ‘You can’t retire because you don’t have the years of contributions,’ but we do have the years of work. What happens is that employers, if you go and present the situation to them, tell you: ‘If you leave, I have 10 people in line after you.’ So, that also demoralizes you,” she says. According to her estimates, Nilda needs to contribute more than $5,000 to retire. Without the moratorium that allowed payment in installments, she would have to pay it all in full before August. “It’s impossible, impossible. Even if my children helped me, I can’t afford it,” she laments. For months now, senior citizens have gathered on Wednesday afternoons in front of Congress in Buenos Aires to protest government policies and particularly its pension reform. Two weeks ago, a protest by retirees, joined by soccer fans and members of social and political organizations, ended in a violent clash between police and protesters. More than 100 people were arrested, and a photojournalist was seriously injured and remains hospitalized. As part of the government’s cuts, Milei vetoed a law in September that would have adjusted pension payments to mitigate pensioners’ loss of purchasing power due to inflation, establishing a minimum pension and setting out an adjustment system based on price and wage developments. Currently, the minimum pension, with an additional bonus, is less than $300, and pensions are updated monthly according to inflation. A system where the numbers don’t add up According to the analysis organization Center for the Implementation of Public Policies for Equity and Growth (CIPPEC), the Argentine pension system stands out for its broad coverage, with 95% of those over 65 receiving some kind of pension. The downside: public spending on the pension system is equivalent to 10% of the country’s GDP, based on data from last year. The latest social security report, from last September, counts 7.8 million retirees and pensioners. Of these, 22% received non-contributory pensions, a benefit that does not require lifetime contributions. Of the remaining 78%, or 6.1 million, who do receive a benefit based on contributions, only 2.2 million did not need to access a moratorium to retire. If she were unable to retire, Nilda could still access a universal pension for older adults (PUAM), equivalent to 80% of a minimum pension, or about $220 per month, and health coverage. However, that benefit is only available starting at age 65. Pension lawyer Christian González D’Alessandro tells CNN that, in this way, “the age of eligibility for a benefit for women will inevitably be raised.” Furthermore, Nilda would lose all the contributions she made during her formal working years as well as the ability to continue working and contributing, if her current employers were to regularize her situation. She would also be unable to collect other types of pensions, such as a widow’s pension. Nilda is still married and has become a grandmother of five. She feels fortunate. Aside from some muscle pain from cycling, she doesn’t usually experience physical discomfort or have any chronic illnesses that require regular medication expenses. With her and her husband’s income, they manage to make ends meet, but even so, she would like to be able to treat her children to meals and cover expenses, or occasionally take her grandchildren to the movies. “I hope that, beyond having a headache or feeling tired, I can still be healthy enough to keep working,” she says about her future.",,0.24797280132770538
"Once again, she’s adopted a wait-and-see strategy. When President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on all cars shipped to the United States this week – a significant escalation in a global trade war – his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum chose pragmatism and patience. Playing the long game is the same strategy President Sheinbaum has used since the beginning of the new American administration, one that has so far saved Mexico from steep tariffs. In 2024, Mexico exported to the United States automobiles and auto parts worth $182.3 billion, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Given those figures, the new auto tariffs announced could pose catastrophic consequences for the Mexican economy – but Sheinbaum chose to keep a cool head. “We’ll have to wait and see what President Trump says, and from there, we’ll have to decide, one way or another, what decisions we’d make. We’ve been through this three times; this would be the third,” Sheinbaum calmly said Wednesday during her daily morning media briefing. The ‘cool head’ approach The day after Trump’s inauguration, Sheinbaum said it was “important to keep a cool head” when she was asked to react to the American president’s first executive orders. Those orders included renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and declaring multiple Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations – an act that could pave the way to using American military force on Mexican soil. Sheinbaum used the same strategy last month, when Trump was about to announce tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., impacting her country, among others. Speaking to reporters at her daily morning briefing, she repeated what had already become her mantra for the Trump administration: “As I said before, [we have to keep a] cool head on this,” she said. Unlike top Canadian officials, Sheinbaum has so far avoided getting into a war of words with her American counterpart. Sheinbaum – a 62-year-old climate scientist and former Mexico City mayor who became the first female president of Mexico in October – has remained pragmatic and calm – at least publicly – to Trump’s goading. For Oscar Ocampo, an analyst at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness in Mexico City, this is a winning strategy. Related article
      Old US-Canada relationship is ‘over,’ warns Canadian prime minister “This is something we must recognize about President Claudia Sheinbaum and her negotiating team. What they have achieved is important. Mexico did well not to show its cards prematurely,” Ocampo told CNN. “Canada announced retaliation from the outset; Mexico didn’t, and it was the right thing to do to allow room for negotiation before imposing any measures,” Ocampo told CNN. Adriana García, a financial analysis coordinator at “Mexico, ¿How Are We Doing So Far?,” a Mexico City think-tank that analyzes the Mexican economy, told CNN that she agrees. Unlike Canada, García said, Mexico has managed to maintain dialogue with top US officials and avoid any highly-mediatized clashes. Regarding the latest threat of 25 percent tariffs to automobiles and auto parts, Sheinbaum has said she will offer a “comprehensive response” on April 3, but signaled that her government is working behind the scenes to remove or reduce fees on certain Mexican-assembled autos and parts. Her team is also putting in the miles. Mexican Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard traveled to Washington once again this week to meet with top US officials regarding the tariffs. By his own count, Ebrard has met with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick six times. “We made progress toward the goal of not charging manufacturers multiple tariffs — a piston crosses the border seven times when assembled — that was already agreed upon by both governments,” Ebrard said during a press briefing earlier this week. Praise for Sheinbaum’s deft management of a tense situation goes beyond her own country; even Trump has recognized her negotiating chops, telling her “You’re tough,” in a phone call last month, according to a recent New York Times report. This is quite a departure for a leader who constantly rails against other heads of states and political enemies. Publicly, Trump has also been complimentary. “Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl,” Trump wrote earlier this month on Truth Social. “Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!” It remains to be seen whether Sheinbaum’s strategy will ultimately succeed, but her presidency and the country depend on it. As former Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo told CNN, who was involved in US-Mexico-Canada trade negotiations during the first Trump administration, broad new tariffs “would be a fundamental blow to the Mexican manufacturing sector that would cause us greater difficulties than we already have – with an economy with zero growth and the possibility of entering a recession.” CNN’s Gabriela Frías and Karen Esquivel in Mexico City contributed to this report",,0.22816839814186096
"A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world’s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics. The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts. Announcing the ban had become law, Mexico’s Education Ministry posted on X: “Farewell, junk food!” And it encouraged parents to support the government’s crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids. Mexico’s ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic. In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation’s food system and “Make America Healthy Again” by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease. Related article
      How the Make America Healthy Again movement swung from RFK Jr. to Trump Under Mexico’s new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020. Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water. “It is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,” said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the effort. Mexico’s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation’s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports. One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics. School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450. But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico’s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains and even reliable internet and electricity. It also wasn’t immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.",,0.2800229787826538
"Heads of state in Latin America and the Caribbean have long complained that the region is treated as an after-thought by most US administrations. But now that the Western Hemisphere is under the microscope from the Trump administration from everything from migration to drug smuggling to human trafficking, those same leaders may be missing the old days of relative benign neglect. US administration officials have taken to referring to the Caribbean as the US’ “third border,” another red line where the flow of drugs, illegal migration and China’s growing influence need to be countered. “When President Donald Trump came into office, he committed to ensuring our foreign policy aligned with our nation’s interests. To realize his vision, we are putting our region, the Americas, first,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in the Miami Herald on Saturday. Some Latin American diplomats privately grumble that the Trump administration is ramping up pressure on their countries at the same time it cuts billions of dollars in badly needed USAID funding to the region. The policy, they say, is more sticks and too few carrots and that the State Department under Rubio has become fixated on opposing Cuban and Venezuelan influence when other issues including the impacts of climate change, rising inequality and a gang-ravaged Haiti on the verge of collapse should take precedence. Related article
      ‘It’s not what he expected’: Rubio has competition for the role of America’s top diplomat Even before Rubio’s trip to the Caribbean region last week, it was clear that his approach would be more “bad cop” than “good cop” as Washington threatens sanctions on foreign officials from countries that hire Cuban doctors and nurses. Punishments could include barring officials and their immediate family members from traveling to the US. It would also deprive Havana of badly needed hard currency. During a Wednesday press conference in Jamaica, Rubio called it forced labor, saying the Cuban “regime does not pay these doctors, takes away their passports.” But the threatened sanctions against Cuba’s medical programs led to a remarkable push back from several Caribbean and Latin American leaders. At the same news conference with Rubio, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said his government planned to keep using Cuban doctors and nurses in their hospitals while showing the US that the program in Jamaica operates according to international labor standards. “In terms of Cuban doctors in Jamaica, let us be clear, the Cuban doctors in Jamaica have been incredibly helpful to us” he said as Rubio, who is Cuban-American and a staunch adversary to the government in Havana, looked on. “Jamaica has a deficit in health personnel primarily because many of our health personnel have migrated to other countries. We are, however, very careful not to exploit the Cuban doctors who are here,” Holness continued. Sanctions busting The other Trump administration focus has been Venezuela. Last week, it threatened to place 25% tariffs on products of countries that purchase Venezuelan oil, sparking concerns that all-ready high energy costs in much of the region could further rise. Related article
      Trump says any country buying Venezuelan oil will face a 25% tariff In February, the Trump administration canceled a Biden-era deal that allowed Venezuela to sell oil to Chevron, depriving the country of a badly needed economic lifeline. But some of the sanctions may already be backfiring or, at least, are having unintended consequences. If the US does succeed in closing oil markets off to Venezuela, the unlikely beneficiary could be Cuba, said energy analyst Jorge Piñón. Rather than stopping production, which is ultimately more costly to restart, Venezuela is likely to send increased oil shipments to its ally Cuba, which has been in recent months enduring some of the worst power outages in years. Previously, the cash-strapped island has paid for the shipments by sending thousands of Cuban medical personnel to work in Venezuela. “Even though Venezuela does not get hard currency from Cuba it provides them with an outlet to keep current production levels,” Piñón told CNN. ”I will not be surprised if we see an increase of Venezuelan oil deliveries to Cuba in the following months as this would keep Venezuela’s oil production flowing,” he said. If that scenario does play out, it would have the exact opposite effect than what the White House or Rubio intended.",,0.2961156368255615
"Mexico’s economic minister Marcelo Ebrard praised the “preferential treatment” received by Mexico after US President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping new global tariffs. On Wednesday, Trump detailed new tariffs on many countries including a minimum 10% “baseline” tariff on imports. Neighboring Mexico and Canada, though still subject to prior tariffs, were exempt from the new reciprocal tariffs. Related article
      Will keeping a ‘cool head’ allow Mexico to avoid the worst of the tariffs? Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that this treatment is due to Mexico’s positive relationship with the US. “There are no additional tariffs to Mexico and that is good for the country,” Sheinbaum said at a Thursday morning press conference, touting her government’s relationship with the Trump administration. “This has to do with the good relationship we have constructed with the US government, based on collaboration but with respect.” “President Sheinbaum’s strategy has worked. We (Mexico) have a preferential treatment,” Ebrard said at the same press conference. Shortly after being sworn in, Trump announced he would implement a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico, but later agreed to pause tariffs for products covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on free trade. The exempted product sectors include: On Wednesday, the White House said this exemption and the tariffs on non-USMCA compliant products would continue until Trump determines the fentanyl and illegal immigration issues have been resolved. However, Mexico remains subject to a separate 25% tariff on cars imported to the US. Sheinbaum said Mexico remains in dialogue with the US about the impact of US tariffs on the automobile industry. During the press conference, Ebrard highlighted that other countries that have trade agreements with the US were still subject to the reciprocal tariffs. “The only (trade) agreement with 0% tariffs is the USMCA,” he said. Sheinbaum said Ebrard will likely travel to Washington next week to discuss the tariffs’ impact on non-USMCA compliant automotives, steel and aluminum sectors. The automotive industry is the most important to Mexico as it accounts for 30% of the country’s imports to the US, Sheinbaum said. The steel and aluminum industries represent “a little more than 2% of the country’s total exports,” according to Ebrard. Mexico’s economy minister says the next 40 days will be seen as a negotiating period for Mexico to achieve the best possible trade conditions. “We estimate it will take around 40 days of negotiations. That’s the reality we’re in. We’re going to consolidate that (preferential) position,” Ebrard said. Sheinbaum also announced a raft of economic measures Thursday that she said will strengthen domestic production of steel and aluminum, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and other sectors. “We are going to strengthen and expand national manufacturing for the domestic vehicle market, strengthening innovation, research and development, as well as energy efficiency. We have already discussed the plan with the automotive industry,” she said. The Mexican leader has repeatedly touted keeping a “cool head” approach when it comes to the Trump administration. Sheinbaum – a 62-year-old climate scientist and former Mexico City mayor who became the first female president of Mexico in October – has remained pragmatic and calm, at least publicly, throughout repeated tariff threats from Washington.

"A Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian president’s home city of Kryvyi Rih on Friday killed at least 19 people, including nine children, one of the deadliest strikes this year in a conflict that shows no sign of a swift end despite a push for peace by the Trump administration. Among the 72 injured was a baby as young as three months old, with the attack also damaging dozens of apartment buildings and six education institutes along with shops and businesses, said Oleksandr Vilkul, Kryvyi Rih mayor, on Telegram on Saturday, calling it a “tragic evening and night.” “Another bloody crime was committed by the terrorist country. Rocket and massive Shahed attacks on residential areas and playgrounds,” the mayor said. Russian troops struck Kryvyi Rih with a ballistic missile with a cluster warhead, which is “designed to hit a larger area and a larger number of people,” the Ukrainian General Staff said. Zelensky’s home town has come under repeated Russian attack in recent months. A deadly strike earlier this month, killed four civilians in a taxi parking lot. US President Donald Trump pledged to bring a quick end to the conflict but has been unable to broker a deal. Ukraine’s allies believe Russia is dragging its feet on negotiations while it tries to secure an advantage on the battlefield. Related article
      Rubio tells Russia the clock is ticking while allies doubt Putin wants peace in Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered his condolences to the families of those killed and injured in his nightly address soon afterward. “Many injured, houses damaged. The missile actually hit the area next to residential buildings – a children’s playground, ordinary streets,” Zelensky said. Russia also targeted a power plant in Kherson with a drone on Friday, Zelensky said. “Such strikes cannot be a coincidence – Russians know that this is an energy facility,” Zelensky said. “These types of facilities must be protected from any attacks, as per the promises Russia made to the American side.” Zelensky criticized the US after the country’s Ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, wrote on X, “Horrified that tonight a ballistic missile struck near a playground and restaurant in Kryvyi Rih. More than 50 people injured and 16 killed, including 6 children. This is why the war must end.” The Ukrainian leader condemned her response, saying that the “reaction of the American Embassy is unpleasantly surprising: such a strong country, such a strong people, and such a weak reaction.” He continued, “They are even afraid to say the word ‘Russian’ when talking about the missile that killed the children.” Addressing the nation later on Saturday, Zelensky said that it was “wrong and dangerous to keep silent about the fact that it is Russia that is killing children with ballistic (missiles).” “It only incites the scumbags in Moscow to continue the war and further ignore diplomacy. Weakness has never ended a war. That is why I am grateful to every country whose representatives have spoken out: leaders, foreign ministers, embassies,” he said. Several European officials condemned Russia for the strike. British Ambassador to Ukraine Martin Harris wrote on X: “While Ukraine pursues peace, Russia is striking civilians far from the frontline. Today’s ballistic missile attack on Kryvyi Rih shows it has no intention to stop the war.” The German Ambassador to Ukraine Martin Jaeger wrote “Russia is the aggressor” while reposting information about the strike on X. In a statement on Telegram, the Russian ministry of defense claimed the strike had targeted a meeting between Ukrainian and Western officers, describing it as “a high-precision strike… with a high-explosive missile on the site of a meeting with unit commanders and Western instructors in one of the restaurants in the city of Kryvyi Rih.” “As a result of the strike, the enemy lost up to 85 servicemen and officers of foreign countries, as well as up to 20 vehicles,” the post claimed. CNN has reached out to Ukrainian authorities for further information. Stalled peace talks It comes as little progress has been made on peace talks to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. In the past week, President Donald Trump’s frustration with his Russian counterpart has become clear. Trump said he was recently “pissed off” on a recent call with the Russian leader, who rejected Trump’s proposal for a full and immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. Ukrainian and European leaders have made clear they believe Putin is stalling, believing time is on his side, while Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff – who has met Putin twice this year – have insisted Putin does want a peace deal. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio revealed on Friday that he had met with an envoy for Putin this week and sent him back to Moscow with a message: the clock is ticking on when there needs to be a breakthrough in the peace talks to end the Ukraine war. Rubio has traveled to Saudi Arabia twice in the past two months for discussions with top Russian and Ukrainian officials to try to launch negotiations over a ceasefire and eventual agreement to end the three-year war. Now though, progress needs to be made, Rubio said. “There can’t be talks about talks.” Last week, following days of separate negotiations with Ukrainian and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, the White House said that the two sides had agreed to a US-brokered agreement to stop using force in the Black Sea while also agreeing to implement a previously announced pause on attacks against energy infrastructure. However, Russia responded by setting additional conditions on the Black Sea ceasefire, including the lifting of sanctions imposed on its banks and exports. This story has been updated.

"US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats from China but that together the United States and Panama will keep it secure. Hegseth’s remarks triggered a fiery response from the Chinese government, which said: “Who represents the real threat to the Canal? People will make their own judgement.” Speaking at a ribbon cutting for a new US-financed dock at the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base after a meeting with Panama President José Raúl Mulino, Hegseth said the US will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation. “To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades,” he said. Hegseth alluded to ports at either end of the canal that are controlled by a Hong Kong consortium, which is in the process of selling its controlling stake to another consortium including BlackRock Inc. “China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” Hegseth said. “That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.” Hegseth met with Mulino for two hours Tuesday morning before heading to the naval base that previously had been the US Rodman Naval Station. On the way, Hegseth posted a photo on X of the two men laughing and said it was an honor speaking with Mulino. “You and your country’s hard work is making a difference. Increased security cooperation will make both our nations safer, stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. Late Tuesday, Mulino and Hegseth released a joint statement. A vaguely worded portion of the statement suggested the two had discussed the tolls the United States pays for its ships crossing the canal. It said that within the canal’s framework, “the Republic of Panama and the United States of America will work, as established, on a mechanism to compensate for the payment of tolls and charges.” Panama’s Foreign Relations Ministry did not immediately answer a request for clarification. But the Spanish and English versions had at least one significant discrepancy. The Spanish version included that “Secretary Hegseth recognized the leadership and inalienable sovereignty of Panama over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas.” That sentence appeared nowhere in the English version. The visit comes amid tensions over Trump’s repeated assertions that the US is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations — allegations that Panama has denied. Shortly after the meeting, the Chinese Embassy in Panama slammed the American government in a statement on X, saying the US has used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama … and something the US doesn’t have the right to interfere in.” “The US has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat’ in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United State’s own geopolitical interests,” the embassy wrote. After Hegseth and Mulino spoke by phone in February, the US State Department said that an agreement had been reached to not charge US warships to pass through the canal. Mulino publicly denied there was any such deal. Trump has gone so far as to suggest the US never should have turned the canal over to Panama and that maybe that it should take the canal back. The China concern was provoked by the Hong Kong consortium holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities. The Hong Kong consortium, however, has already announced that CK Hutchison would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete.

      Panama Canal ports sale has been put on hold by Chinese regulators US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Mulino during a visit in February that Trump believes China’s presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the US to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal. Mulino has denied that China has any influence in the operations of the canal. In February, he expressed frustration at the persistence of the narrative. “We aren’t going to speak about what is not reality, but rather those issues that interest both countries,” he said. The US built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. “I want to be very clear, China did not build this canal,” Hegseth said Tuesday. “China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations through the deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world.”",,0.19065138697624207
"Erik Prince, founder of the controversial security contractor formerly known as Blackwater, joined in law enforcement operations on Saturday in Guayaquil, one of Ecuador’s most violent cities, according to local officials. The operations saw 10 houses raided and 40 people detained, Ecuador’s Interior Minister John Reimberg said. “Since early this morning, the security block together with the American Erik Prince, a security expert, and the Ministers of Defense, Gian Carlo Loffredo and the Minister of the Interior, John Reimberg, were deployed in territory in Guayaquil, especially in the suburbs, attacking criminals and outlining strategies to strengthen the great actions of our law enforcement forces in the field of operations,” Ecuador’s Defense Ministry posted on X Saturday morning. Prince also said in a video posted by Ecuador’s Defense Ministry that he was in the country “providing the law enforcement and the military the tools and the tactics to effectively combat the narco-gangs.” The aim, Prince continued, is to “put the narcos on their back heels and make them truly afraid of being caught.” CNN has reached out to Prince for comment. His visit to the South American nation comes weeks after Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa announced a “strategic alliance” with Prince to fight organized crime. ‘A historic chapter for security’ in Ecuador Ecuador’s Defense Ministry called Prince’s participation on Saturday a “historic chapter for security” for the nation.

      Ecuador is preparing for US forces, plans show, as Noboa calls for help battling gangs The country’s Defense Minister Gian Carlo Loffredo said Prince and his team are currently providing training and advice to Ecuador’s security forces – but added that their scope of action could be expanded. “They may not be limited to just those actions,” Loffredo said. Prince has been in the country for a “few days,” and work is ongoing to develop a new plan to combat Ecuador’s gangs, he also said. CNN has reached out to Ecuador’s Defense Ministry for more information on Prince’s visit. In recent years, Ecuador – which is sandwiched between Colombia and Peru, top producers of cocaine – has become caught up in the drug trade and the violence that always follows it. Its efficient transport and export system has been used by cartels to move and ship their goods overseas — the bricks of cocaine hidden in boxes of bananas and other goods that then head to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. Noboa has increasingly called for foreign help to combat the criminal groups and has even asked US President Donald Trump to designate local gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. Ecuador’s government is currently laying groundwork for US forces to arrive, according to plans obtained by CNN. Noboa’s efforts however will be heavily dependent on next week’s presidential runoff vote. He’s set off to face leftist candidate Luisa Gonzalez, who has positioned herself as equally tough on crime but opposes the presence of any foreign force in the country. In the same video posted by the defense ministry, Prince called on Ecuadorians to vote for Noboa, warning that otherwise Ecuador risked “looking just like Venezuela, a narco-state with massive drug processing with all the criminality and socialism and despair that comes with that.” “I hope Ecuador chooses law and order and we are here to help to combat the gangs and to provide the tools for the government to restore law and order, peace and prosperity,” he added.",,0.42317748069763184
"Panama promotes itself “as the bridge of the world, heart of the universe” but lately the narrow Central American Isthmus and its namesake canal that joins the Atlantic to the Pacific have become the setting for a bitter clash between the world’s two preeminent economic superpowers. The escalating war of words between the US and China over the canal has left Panama – which does not have a military – baffled and brings to mind the old proverb of how “when elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers.” From the beginning of his second term, US President Donald Trump has claimed without proof that China secretly controls the canal where around 40% of US container traffic passes through. If China’s alleged influence over the canal wasn’t halted, Trump threatened to “take back” the iconic waterway that the US returned to Panama in 2000, employing military force if needed. Related article
      Trump wants to reclaim the Panama Canal. He’d be taking on a waterway facing crisis Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino rejects Trump’s claims but has also made significant efforts to placate the White House, such as dropping out of China’s Belt and Road investment initiative in February. In March, US investment giant BlackRock announced a $22.8 billion deal to buy 43 ports, including two located on either side of the Panama Canal, from CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong logistics company that the Trump administration has accused of being under Beijing’s control – something Hutchison denies. But those concessions seem to have only added fuel to the White House’s bellicose rhetoric, most recently this week from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during a visit to Panama to attend the Central American Security Conference. “I want to be very clear, China did not build this canal,” Hegseth said Tuesday. “China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. “Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations through the deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world.” Beijing angrily fired back at Hegseth’s verbal broadsides. “Who represents the real threat to the canal? People will make their own judgment,” China’s government retorted. Hegseth’s statements represented a shift – Panama was again a “partner” that, contrary to what Trump had said, “operates” the canal. Still, the defense secretary stopped short of saying publicly the canal belonged to Panama. Related article
      Pentagon tasked with providing ‘military options’ to ensure US access to Panama Canal, memo says In fact, the Pentagon appeared to omit a key line to that effect from a joint statement, which in the Panamanian version reads, “Secretary Hegseth recognized the leadership and inalienable sovereignty of Panama over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas.” The discrepancy over the statement called into mind a similar puzzling episode in February where the State Department announced that Panama would waive tolls on US Navy ships going through the canal; Mulino the next day angrily denied his government had ever agreed to that. But on Wednesday Panama’s Canal Affairs Minister José Ramón Icaza told reporters that the Panama Canal Authority agreed to find a “mechanism” that allows US Naval ships to pass through the canal at a “neutral cost” in exchange for security provided by those ships and the US recognizing Panamanian sovereignty over the canal. Even though, according to Panama’s government, US Navy ships only spend on average a few million dollars each year crossing through the canal, the Trump administration had pushed hard for the concession from the Canal Authority which according to Panamanian law is supposed to charge all countries the same rates for crossings. Mulino has proven to be a key ally on immigration to Washington. During the Biden administration, Mulino had already begun closing the Darien Gap, where hundreds of thousands had crossed on their way to the US and by accepting deportation flights from the US. But there are clearly limits on which US demands he can accommodate, as his countrymen and much of the region grow exasperated by increasing saber rattling from Trump and demands for further concessions. On Wednesday, at a news conference, Hegseth alluded to the possibility of reestablishing US military bases to guard the canal. Minutes later, with Hegseth looking on, Panama’s Security Minister Frank Ábrego flatly denied that Mulino was considering the possibility of allowing US bases in the country. It’s not clear if Trump will take “no” for an answer and as the US-China tug of war over the canal heats up, Panama is clearly feeling the strain.",,0.29777792096138

City police said their investigation showed that a bracelet found on the remains belonged to Alessandro Coatti, a biologist who had recently embarked on a trip through South America. More remains were later found at two other locations around the city. Coatti had been staying at an establishment in the city and had presumably been visiting the scenic shoreline Tayrona area on April 5, police said. But what happened to him remains the subject of an urgent investigation by local authorities. Related article
      This American went to Colombia to kite surf. He’s been detained in Venezuela for months. “At present there is no further detail about what happened; it is under investigation,” read information provided by the Colombian prosecutor’s office on Thursday. “It is not yet known what occurred or where.” Only three pieces of his body have been recovered, it also said. Santa Marta mayor Carlos Pinedo Cuello has vowed to find those responsible; in a public notice on Monday, the city described Coatti’s death as a homicide and announced a 50 million peso (approximately US$11,300) reward for information that would help Colombian authorities. Italy’s foreign ministry is helping Coatti’s family and Italian police are collaborating with Colombian authorities on the case, a ministry spokesperson told CNN. Coatti had worked in London for the Royal Society of Biology (RSB) for eight years before leaving the organization in 2024 to travel South America, the organization said. “Ale was funny, warm, intelligent, loved by everyone he worked with, and will be deeply missed by all who knew and worked with him. Our thoughts and best wishes go out to his friends and family at this truly awful time,” the RSB said in a statement, calling him a “passionate and dedicated” scientist who led the group’s animal science work.

"Nearly 200 people were killed in the Dominican Republic after the roof of an iconic nightclub collapsed in what has become one of the country’s deadliest tragedies in decades. At least 300 people were inside Jet Set nightclub early Tuesday morning, in the capital of Santo Domingo, when the roof collapsed around 1 a.m. during a performance of merengue artist Rubby Pérez and his orchestra, authorities said. Pérez’s body was recovered from the scene on Wednesday morning, emergency services said. At least 184 people, including two former Major League Baseball players, were killed, according to Juan Manuel Méndez, the director of the Emergency Operations Center, in an update on Wednesday. The exact number of the injured has yet to be provided by officials, with Méndez saying earlier that 145 people who had been rescued on Tuesday were “alive.” It is also unclear how many people are unaccounted for, and on Wednesday, emergency responders said they would end rescue efforts after recovering another 20 bodies from the rubble. Many bodies have yet to be identified. Aerial footage showed the venue with a wide, gaping hole in the middle of the building where the audience would have been located during the performance. The cause of the roof’s collapse is not yet known. Desperate families were seen outside the destroyed venue on Wednesday, hoping that their loved ones would be rescued from the debris. Local news footage on Wednesday showed some searching for the names of their loved ones in lists hanging on a field hospital outside the venue, while others went from hospital to hospital in search of news. Crews had been working tirelessly since Tuesday to find signs of life. But the search for victims has strained them. “The past two days have been difficult because when people are trapped, you’re not feeling well mentally,” one responder told CNN. Footage from inside the venue appears to show the moment the crisis unfolded on Tuesday morning. Related article
      Octavio Dotel, 15-year MLB veteran, dies in Dominican Republic nightclub roof collapse One video shows the band performing while someone near the stage points out that something had fallen in the back of the Jet Set club. Moments later, pendant lights suspended from the ceiling start to collapse, along with the entire roof overhead. Screams and crashing sounds can be heard for a few seconds before the video goes dark. At least one US citizen and an unspecified number of US residents died in the tragic event, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Wednesday. Former Major League Baseball player Octavio Dotel was among those killed on Tuesday, according to Méndez and Dotel’s foundation. He died on the way to the hospital after being rescued alive from the rubble, Méndez told CNN. Dotel’s education academy, Colegio Sabiduría y Baluarte, mourned him in a statement, saying he leaves “an indelible mark on all of us who had the privilege of knowing and working alongside him.” Another former major leaguer, Tony Blanco, also died after the collapse, MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred and the Dominican Sports Ministry said. “We share in their grief with their family, friends, and colleagues, and we offer our prayers for their eternal rest,” the ministry said of Blanco in a statement. Also among the dead was Nelsy Cruz, governor of the Monte Cristi province, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. Cruz was related to MLB all-star Nelson Cruz, according a statement from his family mourning her death. Another former baseball star, Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez, said on Instagram that some of his family members in the Dominican Republic are missing. “With a heavy heart I send condolences to all our family members and the people in the United States that have family in the Dominican Republic. We are sad and affected by the tragedy,” said Martinez. The son of Public Works Minister Eduardo Estrella was also among the missing, officials said. Survivors and responders speak out Pérez’s daughter Zulinka survived the collapse thanks in part to her husband, she told reporters on Tuesday. She said her husband shielded her with his body and told her to get out immediately so their child “won’t be left alone.” Her husband also made it out but suffered a broken leg, she said. Almost immediately after the roof caved in, Gov. Cruz called President Abinader – while she was trapped under the rubble – to alert him of the tragedy, according to First Lady Raquel Arbaje. “The president started mobilizing all the organizations” to send help right after the call, she said. Another survivor, Jenniré Mena of Venezuela, told CNN that she was at the club celebrating her 40th birthday with two of her friends. One of them died and the other got trapped under the rubble with Jenniré. For hours, they comforted each other by holding hands until they were rescued around 5 a.m. “I’m grateful to be alive, feeling a lot of pain, but grateful to have the opportunity to feel this pain,” she said. First responders have been providing health and emotional support services for grieving family members still searching for their loved ones, Rosmery Lebron of the Dominican Red Cross told CNN. Search efforts have also taken a mental toll on rescue workers. “You hear people who are trapped, screaming for help – it’s a bit difficult,” said Daniel Heredia, a member of the Dominican Civil Protection Service, who’s all too familiar with loss and pain. He lost a leg after an injury 15 years ago, and now, using a prosthetic leg, he leads a rescue team to search for survivors. Personnel from at least 22 public institutions were at the site helping with response efforts, officials said. Nine rescue workers from Israel and 12 from Puerto Rico also provided help, Méndez said Wednesday. Three days of mourning Abinader has declared three days of mourning following the disaster. He traveled to the nightclub later Tuesday morning with his First Lady Arbaje to express their condolences to families of the victims. “We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub,” Abinader wrote on X. “All rescue agencies have provided the necessary assistance and are working tirelessly in the rescue efforts. Our prayers are with the affected families.” Carolina Mejía de Garrigó, the city’s mayor, said Tuesday that Santo Domingo was waking “to a terrible tragedy,” offering her condolences to families “still waiting for news of their loved ones.” The Jet Set nightclub is one of the Caribbean nation’s most famous venues, and its Monday night events are especially well attended.

"Does America want its friends back? After three months of insulting, tariffing and even threatening to annex some of its best allies, the Trump administration suddenly needs some help. The US President has now escalated a full-on trade clash with China that he doesn’t seem to know how to win. So the administration is rushing to work out how to build leverage against Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is in no mood to cede to Trump’s bullying. Related live-story
      Trump’s trade war escalates as China raises tariffs on US goods But there’s one thing that might work. It would bring to bear America’s strength and global power and could perhaps build pressure on Beijing to act on consistent US complaints about market access, theft of intellectual property, industrial espionage and other issues. There’s only one problem: This approach would conflict with Trump’s “America first” mantra. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pointed out on Fox Business this week that US allies such as Japan, South Korea and India would soon be in trade talks with Washington, as would Vietnam. “Everyone is coming to the table, and basically China is surrounded,” he said. Bessent added that a topic of talks should be a joint goal: “How do we get China to rebalance? That is the big win here.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked on Friday why American allies would help it counter China when Trump was treating friends and foes alike. She replied: “You’ll have to talk to our allies who are reaching out to us. The phones are ringing off of the hooks. They have made it very clear they need the United States of America, they need our markets, they need our consumer base.” But everything that Trump has done since he arrived back in the Oval Office has been designed to destroy groups of like-minded democracies. Several times this week, he dissed the European Union. “I always say it was formed to really do damage to the United States in trade,” he said. He’s not the only Europe hater. Vice President JD Vance revealed his distaste for the continent at the Munich Security forum and also in a group chat of officials about air strikes in Yemen. Trump’s spite in the Western hemisphere is also an issue. A unified North American trading powerhouse has long been seen as a potential bulwark against China. But Trump has repeatedly threatened to take over Canada and has targeted Mexico with some of his toughest tariffs. New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has warned that his country’s traditional relationship with Washington is over. Still, the idea of building an allied front to try to modify China’s trade practices is such a good idea, it’s a wonder no one thought of it before. They did. And Trump shut it down. On the first day of his first term in 2017, Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a group of 12 nations including allies like Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Australia, as well as Japan that did not include China. The president also shut down a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that would have linked the world’s two largest markets. The question now is whether Trump has so alienated America’s friends that they won’t take his calls. “The US right now is an incredibly unreliable partner to anyone in the world, and I don’t know how we are going to get back to being reliable,” Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, told CNN on Thursday.",,0.25646907091140747
"Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro was hospitalized for severe abdominal pain related to a wound sustained when he was stabbed on the campaign trail seven years ago.

"Defying predictions and expectations, incumbent Daniel Noboa won Ecuador’s presidential election with a clear lead, securing his power at a time when the right on the South American continent looks towards US President Donald Trump as a model to emulate. Noboa’s stance on combating organized crime amid the country’s security crisis resonated with voters, even though new international cooperation agreements have yet to materialize. Noboa’s win can be framed within a moment when the Latin American right seeks to leverage Trump’s mandate, according to analysts consulted by CNN. A right-wing movement that looks up to Trump “There is a trend towards the right in general in Latin America, mainly due to the terrible governments that have held power under the poorly termed ‘Socialism of the 21st century,’” Eduardo Gamarra, a professor at Florida International University, told CNN. Noboa’s victory reflects “the Latin American right will maintain this very important position in Ecuador and also has significant connections, of course, with other countries: there is a relationship between Noboa and (El Salvador’s President Nayib) Bukele and—as we all know—there is now a very close relationship between Noboa and President Trump,” Gamarra explained. In early April, Noboa met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Florida. In a later interview, Noboa said the meeting was private and rated it as positive, without going into details. Documents obtained by CNN show that the president is preparing to house US military forces in a new naval base on the Ecuadorean coast. “The government is also open to international bases, which is why we proposed a bill in the Assembly through the Acción Democrática Nacional (ADN) movement and also to have joint work with the Ecuadorian Army and the National Police,” Noboa said April, referring to cooperation with the US on security matters. In 2024, Noboa presented a partial amendment of the constitution to modify an article that prohibits “the existence of foreign military bases and facilities for military purposes” in the country. If the project is approved, it would be sent to a referendum for citizen voting. Last year, Noboa reaffirmed two military agreements between Ecuador and the US. “Indeed, what we have seen is a president very close to the United States government and very leveraged on the possibility that the United States government provides assistance at the security level,” explained analyst Ruth Hidalgo, executive director of the Corporación Participación Ciudadana and dean of the School of Political Science at the University of the Americas.

      Here’s what to know about Ecuador’s election winner The realm of foreign relations is a key point for Noboa’s new term, beyond the approach to the US. “There is no script on how the country will position itself, not only on drug trafficking and insecurity but in general terms on the international environment,” says Santiago Basabe, a professor at the San Francisco University of Quito and director of the Ecuadorian Association of Political Science (Aecip). “One of the big issues for Noboa is whether there is a true foreign policy for Ecuador. Where are we going to walk in terms of security, in terms of drug trafficking, in terms of which countries we will have closer or farther relationships with?” Basabe questions. For Basabe, Noboa’s relationship with leftist leaders like Colombian President Gustavo Petro and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is a mystery. These are two important countries for Ecuador. In the case of Mexico, there is also the challenge of the rupture of relations after the assault on that country’s embassy in Quito in 2024. The economy and dollarization Noboa gained ground in places where, in the first round, the opposing candidate Luisa González performed better, such as Guayaquil. “The reasons are related to issues like dollarization, for example,” explains Basabe, referring to the monetary system in effect for the last 25 years in Ecuador, which has broad citizen support. But González’s discourse on strengthening the model “never fully convinced” the voters, said Basabe. González proposed that to protect dollarization, there would be an increase in the number of currencies entering Ecuador, and she suggested strengthening the national industry to increase exports and investment in education, health, and infrastructure. However, throughout the campaign, her political group’s positions on the subject were considered contradictory. Diego Borja, González’s vice-presidential candidate, who also served as Minister of Economy and Finance in 2006 under then-President Rafael Correa, was scrutinized because of an academic article published in 2000 that referred to a “way out” of dollarization. Additionally, in March, Correa’s assembly member Paola Cabezas questioned the traditional approach to dollarization in Ecuador and stated that “we need to have a dollarization that is Ecuadorian.” Related video
      CNN gets rare access embedded with Ecuadorian police and military During the campaign, President Noboa said that Correísmo, the political current of former president Rafael Correa (2007-2017) represented by González, intended to establish a parallel currency, the so-called “ecuadollars.” In the presidential debate in March, González said she would “guarantee” dollarization and urged voters “not to be fooled” about it. Noboa confirmed the dollar as the “only official means of payment” in Ecuador in a decree in March. Economic stability was, therefore, a factor that may have influenced voters’ decisions in the second round. Basabe indicates that, in addition, his travels across the country delivering public works gave him an advantage: “The delivery of works and some other government measures, which one might also qualify as clientelist, could have also influenced.” The challenge of governability Noboa enters a new term with a divided Congress, elected in February. Professor Gamarra explains that the left-wing “Revolución Ciudadana will likely have the majority in Congress based on alliances that will probably be consolidated with the indigenous movement Pachakutik and with other much smaller parties.” “Considering that with certainty or with high probability the legislature will be controlled by Revolución Ciudadana,” Noboa “has to generate very important changes in his policy,” opines Professor Basabe. How will he carry out his political agenda to gain support? In that context, the reference point returns to the US. “We are seeing the trend in the United States as well: even though President Trump has control of both chambers, there is a trend towards governing by decree, by presidential directive,” explains Gamarra. The analyst describes this trend as a problem of Latin American presidentialism and somewhat explains the voters’ decision: “When there is a deadlock with Congress, there is a trend for executive powers to govern by decree. And in the context of great insecurity, the Ecuadorian people demand greater security and are willing to give up rights.” Related article
      Ecuador is preparing for US forces, plans show, as Noboa calls for help battling gangs Pollster and political advisor Jaime Durán Barba, on the other hand, believes that Noboa has an easier path in this second term. It is, says Durán Barba, “a huge change in Ecuadorian politics since the first-round elections, where for the first time a large block that is not Correísmo and is not from Revolución Ciudadana appears in Congress in 20 years.” Durán Barba points out as a significant fact that the most voted deputy in the country—who by law is entitled to the presidency of Congress—is Noboa’s mother, Anabela Azín. “That is a radical change. Correísmo has had a majority in the Ecuadorian Parliament for over 20 years. I think it will be much easier for Noboa to govern.” Durán Barba also considers that the ground gained in the indigenous provinces indicates that the indigenous vote did not act according to “the national leadership”: the Pachakutik Movement, the political wing of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), the most important in the country, consolidated a programmatic agreement with candidate González before the second round. “The deputies respond to the local indigenous forces, and they will very easily be part of Noboa’s majority,” says Durán Barba. Noboa’s new term not only ensures the continuation of his political project—it also signals a broader ideological realignment in Latin America. With a growing shift towards figures like Trump and Bukele, and a region-wide move to the right, Ecuador could become a bellwether for similar movements. The real test now lies in how Noboa governs: whether he can deliver on his promises, navigate tense regional diplomacy, and address public security. His next steps could help boost the right-wing momentum in Latin America in the elections to come. CNN’s Ana María Cañizares contributed to this report.",,0.3491966426372528
"Ecuador has talked to the United States about receiving support in its battle against criminal gangs, President Daniel Noboa said in an exclusive interview with CNN, his first since winning Sunday’s presidential election. “There are plans … we had conversations, we had a plan, we had options that we would like to follow. And now we just need another meeting, post-election, now as an elected president, to consolidate it,” Noboa told CNN’s Fernando del Rincon on Tuesday. Ecuador has been requesting foreign military support for months, saying that its fight against gangs is a “transnational war” that requires the contribution of multiple countries. Noboa said that while his administration “would love to have” US forces in Ecuador, he insisted that they would not be out patrolling the streets. Instead, they would play a supportive role in Ecuador’s security operations. Related article
      Daniel Noboa consolidates power in Ecuador as regional right wing gains momentum “We would like to cooperate with US forces, and I think there are many ways that we can do that, especially in monitoring illegal operations that move out of Ecuador, but the control of the operations will be in the hands of our military and our police,” he said. Ecuador has been laying the groundwork for US forces to arrive, according to plans obtained by CNN. A high-level Ecuadorian official familiar with the planning told CNN last month that the country is constructing a new naval facility in the coastal city of Manta, with the expectation that it “will be eventually occupied by US troops.” The US has previously carried out operations in that area.  From 1999 to 2009, it ran surveillance flights targeting drug routes in the eastern Pacific at the now-defunct Manta Air Base. Noboa told CNN on Tuesday he is seeking to reform the constitution to allow foreign military presence in the country again, and is open to having military bases to help control illegal operations such as drug trafficking, illegal fishing and mining. “That would help to keep peace … like we had in the past with the Manta base,” he said. He said the US had been waiting until the outcome of Sunday’s election to resume talks. Noboa won the vote decisively against leftist lawyer Luisa González, having campaigned on a promise to restore security with a hardline approach and revitalize the economy. Noboa, who was born and educated in the United States, has been trying to boost cooperation with Washington on various issues – from trade to migration. On the latter issue, he says he wants to improve living conditions at home to incentivize Ecuadorians to remain in the country, instead of migrating to the US. Related video
      CNN gets rare access embedded with Ecuadorian police and military Asked whether his relationship with US President Donald Trump is comparable to the one Trump has cultivated with El Salvador’s strongman President Nayib Bukele – who has agreed to take in deported migrants from the US accused of violent crimes – Noboa said his situation is different. “My case is different than El Salvador’s case. And we both respect each other. We both support each other, but at the same at the same time, different realities. And we need to view things according to each country and each country,” he said, noting that he has invited both Trump and Bukele to his inauguration on May 24. Asked whether another meeting with US officials was on the horizon, he replied, “Yes, I think sooner (rather) than later.” The national police says the start to the year has been the most violent in the country’s history, with more than 2,500 homicides. Data from organized crime research center InSight Crime suggests Ecuador now has the highest homicide rate in Latin America, with nearly twice as many killings as Mexico. The surge has been fueled by drug trafficking routes, turf wars and alliances between local gangs and foreign cartels. In March, Noboa also announced a “strategic alliance” to fight organized crime with Erik Prince, the founder of the controversial private defense contractor formerly known as Blackwater.

The power outage that temporarily brought operations to a halt at London’s Heathrow Airport in March is just the latest major incident to spark widespread flight disruptions. Whether it’s a fire or a technical meltdown or a weather system that wreaks havoc on schedules, here’s some advice on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled. Before you go to the airport As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room. “Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. “Save yourself the drive to the airport.” Other tips from Keyes: If you’re at the airport already Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you’ve arrived at the airport. Heathrow is instructing travelers to stay away from the airport, but what if you’re elsewhere in the world, hoping to get to London and now stuck in departures? Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents’ desk. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said. Then you might want to call up your carrier while you’re waiting. It might be faster to get through to a call center. “Whatever happens first, great,” he said. Other tactics you can try: Attitude and research matter Whether you’re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference. “Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. … The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.” He had another tip when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.” Other considerations: Related article
      World’s best airline for 2024 named by Skytrax Help from other airlines Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor. “When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel. “This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.” Frequent flyer miles Thanks to changes in frequent flyer programs over the past several years, airlines often still have flights available with miles even when demand is high during a weather event, Julian Kheel, founder and CEO of Points Path, told CNN Travel in an email. “You’ll need to be prepared to spend a lot of miles, and you may not get the best value for them. But you could save yourself some significant cash if you’re trying to evacuate away from a storm,” Kheel said. “Most US airlines now allow you to cancel flights booked with frequent flyer miles without any fee or penalty right up until departure time. That means you can book multiple alternate flights on different airlines using your miles in case one of them ends up delayed or canceled. “But don’t try to book alternate flights on the same airline, as duplicates can be automatically canceled. And don’t forget to cancel the remaining flights you don’t end up using so you can get your miles back.” Trapped for the night What do you do if it looks like you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city? This depends on the specifics of your situation — in the US, for example, airlines aren’t legally required to put you up in a hotel. US-based airlines have their own individual policies that are tracked by the FAA, here. But UK law is different — so, if you’re being impacted by the current Heathrow cancelations, you’ll likely be automatically entitled to food and drink vouchers and accommodation. You can read all the details at the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)’s website. Your canceled flight will be covered by UK law if was supposed to be departing from the UK, no matter who you were flying with. And if your flight was supposed to be arriving in the UK, you’ll be covered by UK law as long as you were traveling on an EU or UK airline. This document from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority explains all the ins and outs of these rules. Despite this, sometimes airlines can’t help everyone, as the CAA says, “this can happen when staff are stretched during major disruptions.” The CAA advice is to organize “reasonable care and assistance yourself, then claim the cost back later. If you end up paying for things yourself, keep every receipt and do not spend more than is reasonable.” Other things to consider: Travel insurance and receipts Consider buying travel insurance, advised Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel. It said “most travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.” The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later. New automatic refunds in the US Airlines in the United States are now required to give passengers cash refunds if their flight is significantly delayed or canceled, even if that person does not explicitly ask for a refund. The Department of Transportation says the final federal rule requiring that airlines dole out refunds — not vouchers — went into effect on October 28, 2024.

"Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay. The shutdown of London’s Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, is causing chaos across the world today, with thousands of flights affected and major disruption expected to last for days. At least 1,351 flights so far have been impacted by Friday’s closure, which is due to a “significant power outage” caused by a large fire nearby. Some experts predict that it will take several days for the airport to resume full operation and to clear flight backlogs. A spokesperson for Heathrow, which flies up to 291,000 passengers a day, has since announced that the west London airport will be resuming some flights later today and “hope to run a full operation tomorrow.” “Our teams have worked tirelessly since the incident to ensure a speedy recovery,” reads a statement from Heathrow. “We’re pleased to say we’re now safely able to begin some flights later today. Our first flights will be repatriation flights and relocating aircraft.” “Passengers are advised not to travel to the airport and should contact their airline for further information. We apologize for the inconvenience.” According to live flight-tracking website Flightradar24, at least 120 aircraft were en route to the airport, which connects London with over 230 destinations in nearly 90 countries, when the unexpected closure was announced. Heathrow is currently the base for 90 different airlines, including the UK’s flag carrier British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. “As the busiest airport in Europe, Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, therefore getting back to a full and safe operation takes time,” the spokesperson added. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium indicates that 615 flights are scheduled to depart from Heathrow on Saturday, with a further 604 flights due to fly to the airport. So how long is the disruption from the closure likely to last for? “The impact of this incident can cascade over several days, as aircraft, crew, passengers are out of place, with limited spare aircraft and seats available to recover passengers,” says the analytics firm. Significant impact Paul Charles, CEO of the PC Agency, a leading travel consultancy based in London, has suggested that the disruption may last up to a week before returning to normal. “I would expect (Heathrow) by tomorrow to have some power back on stream, but the longer this goes on, the more the costs mount up, the more disruption for passengers, of course, and I would expect it to be a week at this rate before things are back to normal,” Charles told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “You will not be able to go back to all systems operating as normal in one fell swoop,” he said. Charles estimates that losses for airlines affected by the airport shutdown could run up to $25 to 35 million. “That is based on all airlines being affected. … This is every single airline that flies in and out of Heathrow with 290,000 passengers, both in and outbound during a 24-hour period,” he said. Charles points out that costs would include planes being out of place, the extra fuel required to move the planes and crew around, as well as extra costs for passengers, such as car hire and extra hotel accommodation. Brett Snyder, who runs a concierge air travel assistance service and website named Cranky Flier, describes the situation as “shocking,” noting that the closure will “absolutely’ have a ripple effect on other airports and airlines. “It is definitely going to be a mess that needs to be untangled,” he said. Snyder stresses that “there’s no way to know” how long the effects of the closure may last, at this stage, explaining that it depends on how long it takes for Heathrow to resume normal operations. He added that British Airways passengers would likely see the largest effects on their travel plans, while the the outage will “probably not be that big of an issue” for those traveling on US airlines. As the outage took place before the summer spike in travel, airlines may have more “excess capacity to help get passengers where they need to go,” he said. “Customers due to travel from Heathrow on Friday are advised not to travel to the airport until further notice,” reads a statement from British Airways on Friday. “This will clearly have a significant impact on our operation and our customers and we’re working as quickly as possible to update them on their travel options for the next 24 hours and beyond.” Flights have been diverted to alternative destinations wherever possible, with airports at Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Germany’s Frankfurt, Ireland’s Shannon and Gatwick Airport, the UK’s second largest airport, already accepting several. Seven United Airlines flights have returned to their point of origin or been diverted to other airports, according to the American carrier. “During the closure of London Heathrow airport, United is offering flexibility to customers with a travel waiver allowing them to switch eligible flights to Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris or Edinburgh,” the airline said in a statement on Friday, adding that it expected “to operate most scheduled Friday departures to London.” Singapore Airlines has confirmed that three flights en route to London have either been diverted to Frankfurt or Paris or returned to Singapore. Five flights to and from Heathrow have since been canceled, said the airline. Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific told CNN that several flights to and from London were canceled Friday. Related article
      British Airways hit by delays and disruption after ‘technical issue’ Air France canceled eight flights to and from Heathrow, but the flag carrier of France says routes to other UK airports are operating normally. “If you are traveling to or from London Heathrow today, please do not proceed to your departure airport at this time,” Virgin Atlantic said, adding that it would be “offering flexible options” to allow customers to adapt their travel plans. “You can choose to be rebooked onto the next available flight, reschedule your journey for a later date, or change your destination within our direct network. If you no longer wish to travel, you may also request a refund,” the airline’s website recently added. Low-cost airline Ryanair has launched eight “rescue flights” between Dublin and London Stansted to help affected passengers, with four operating Friday, and another four on Saturday. Passenger Kim Mikkel Skibrek, a 40-year-old US-Norwegian citizen, was on a Delta Air Lines flight from the US to London when it had to turn back to Minneapolis after just three hours. Safety priority “Everything is fine,” he told CNN. “People were frustrated with the flight returning after over three hours but now it seems everyone is calmer.” Skibrek says he’s hoping to be able to board another flight to London as soon as possible. “The situation at Heathrow Airport is incredibly difficult, an incident like this at one of the world’s busiest airports will have a very significant knock-on impact on all travel for the next few days,” Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive officer of the Advantage Travel Partnership, said in a statement. “Of course, the priority for everyone is safety, and the airport and the airlines will be working hard today to make sure the area is safe and that they can resume operations as soon as possible.” Lo Bue-Said went on to point out that Friday is “typically the busiest day for travel,” and the incident will undoubtedly have a knock on effect. “Therefore, the reality is that the London airports would have been busy today already and this incident will exacerbate it further,” she added. Shukor Yusof, founder of Singapore-based Endau Analytics, an advisory firm focused on the aviation industry, told CNN that financial losses from the shutdown could be in the “hundreds of millions of pounds.” The fallout “will cause chaos, undoubtedly, for the weekend and into next week because they have to resolve all those flights that couldn’t come in, all those problems that have piled up because of this shutdown,” he said. A record-breaking 83.9 million passengers passed through Heathrow in 2024, according to recent data.

"When traveler Billie woke up on her flight from Doha, Qatar, to London on Friday morning, she spotted a beautiful sunrise out of the airplane window. This stunning view of clouds streaked with gold should have been the perfect end to Billie’s “once in a lifetime trip” to the Seychelles, where she’d been celebrating her honeymoon with her husband, Richard. Then Richard tapped Billie on the shoulder and dropped an unexpected bombshell. She’d slept through the pilot’s announcement that their flight QR011 had rerouted due to a power issue at Heathrow. No flights were arriving or departing from the London hub for the rest of the day. And no, that was not a beautiful view of their home city of London from the airplane window. “Richard had the pleasure of telling me when I woke up that we were halfway through landing in Germany,” Billie told CNN Travel. Billie and Richard are just two of the thousands of travelers caught up in the widespread disruption caused by a total shut down at London’s Heathrow Airport on Friday. CNN agreed not to use Billie and Richard’s full names out of respect for their privacy. The power issue, caused by a fire at a nearby substation, brought air traffic in and out of Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest air hubs, to a halt. The airport was expected to be closed until “at least midnight,” but it later announced that it was able to restart some flights late Friday. The disruption led to midair turnarounds, last-minute diversions to other countries, passengers boarding planes that never took off and a knock-on effect on air travel across the globe. ‘A collective groan’ When the Heathrow shutdown news hit Billie and Richard’s Qatar Airways flight — about 90 minutes before the scheduled arrival time in London — Richard recalls a “sort of shocked silence and atmosphere of disbelief on the plane” followed by “a collective groan.” For Billie and Richard, this was the second leg of their return from the Seychelles. The whole thing was “quite the come down after our beautiful honeymoon,” Billie said. “It was really jarring,” said Billie. “We’d been travelling for around 15 hours by this point and were both quite jet lagged and sleep deprived, so the idea of getting off the plane and trying to figure out what to do now felt very overwhelming!” On board their Qatar Airways flight, she said crew were unable to pass on any more detail about the extent of the cancellations, or when travelers might be able to fly to Heathrow. And on the ground in Frankfurt, local airport staff seemed — at least initially — totally unaware of the situation. “I think we were one of the first planes diverted to Frankfurt,” said Billie. “The lovely passport control officer gave us a big smile and asked how long we were going to spend enjoying Frankfurt and we had to explain that we hadn’t really planned to come to Frankfurt.” From there, things only got more chaotic. The couple joined a line to speak to Qatar ground staff, only to realize, after an hour of waiting, that they were in the wrong line. Despite the stress and uncertainty, the atmosphere among stranded passengers was convivial, according to Billie. “Other passengers were all trying to be positive and helpful and share information with each other. That was really nice,” she said. “I think the Qatar staff were also doing their best with a very overwhelming and unprecedented situation — the people we spoke to were lovely, they just didn’t seem to have a lot of information for us.” Billie says airline staff seemed “as shocked as we were.” Related article
      How air travel worldwide is being disrupted after fire near UK’s Heathrow Airport Wide scale disruption On the ground in Frankfurt, Billie and Richard spoke to other travelers and said they felt thankful they were returning from their honeymoon, rather than trying to get there. Other passengers across the globe were less fortunate. Some flights that were already en route to London were forced to return to their departure airport when the Heathrow news hit. Passenger Kim Mikkel Skibrek had been in the air on a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to Heathrow for three hours when the pilot announced the plane was returning to the US. Skibrek, a US-Norwegian citizen, was trying to travel to Oslo, via London, to see his father, who has cancer. Meanwhile, Abby Hertz, a passenger on the same Delta flight, was heading to London with her husband and two children for a wedding on Saturday. When Hertz spoke to CNN Friday morning, her family was in the middle of being rebooked on a flight to Heathrow, scheduled to leave Friday night and arrive Saturday morning — just hours before the ceremony. It’s going to be tight, but she took this as good news. “We just might make the wedding after all!” Hertz told CNN. CNN journalist Amy Woodyatt was also on a Heathrow-bound flight that was diverted to Spain’s Madrid–Barajas Airport. Woodyatt said passengers from the British Airways flight weren’t immediately given guidance from the airline on luggage, or if they will be able to travel to London by another means in the coming hours. CNN aviation expert Richard Quest also got caught up in the chaos, he was on a flight from Brazil’s Sao Paulo waiting to travel to Heathrow, which was grounded for several hours before passengers were disembarked and bussed back to the airport. “Now I have just got to work out where I’m going to sleep,” said Quest. “There are lots of people who are making the same decision: get a hotel; abandon the trip and go home; change direction?” Amid the shutdown, some Heathrow-bound flights were rerouted to London’s Gatwick airport, where there were reports of hours-long lines and confused, tired passengers.

      What to do if your flight is canceled or delayed ‘I’m so excited about seeing my bed’ As for Billie and Richard, after tracking down the right line at Frankfurt Airport, they were eventually offered Frankfurt hotel vouchers by Qatar Airlines staff, but there was still “no guarantee of when or how we’d get home.” With family and work commitments in London, the couple decided to make their own plan and bought what they said were the last seats on a Eurostar train from Brussels to London departing Friday afternoon. “We’re mostly exhausted right now, we’re both running on very little sleep and we’ve been travelling for almost 24 hours now, with six hours of trains ahead,” Billie said. She says they’re “tentatively hopeful” of reaching London by Friday evening. “I’m so excited about seeing my bed,” Billie added.

As of April 2, European Union citizens join travelers from 48 countries around the world now required to have Electronic Travel Authorisation to enter the UK. Previously, travelers from the EU could hop on a plane and simply present themselves at passport control on landing. Now, travelers who don’t need a visa to enter the UK must get pre-travel authorization via the new digital registration scheme. Here’s what to know about the new rules. Who needs an ETA? Anyone who doesn’t need a visa to travel to the UK will need an ETA — an “electronic travel authorization” which pre-clears you for entry to the country before travel. This is the UK equivalent of the United States’ ESTA — a mandatory, paid-for authorization to travel, with security clearance done in advance. The scheme debuted to Gulf Cooperation Council nationals in 2024, and was later rolled out to other non-European travelers — including the six million travelers from the US, Canada and Australia who enter the UK each year. The full list of 48 states requiring the ETA is here. Travelers from these countries have been required to have an ETA to enter the UK since January 8. EU citizens will need an ETA to enter the UK from April 2, 2025. Citizens of these countries who are already resident in the UK do not need an ETA. The scheme is for “short” visits to the UK of less than six months for tourism and business. There are a few other categories of ETA, including for short-term study and permitted paid engagements. These are listed on the UK government website. Is it a visa? Although some people are referring to it as a visa, it’s actually a visa waiver. Travelers whose citizenship means they need a visa to enter the UK will still need to apply for a visa. (They won’t, however, need to get the ETA on top of that.) Countries work on reciprocity when it comes to immigration. When the United States introduced its ESTA visa waiver in 2009, it was inevitable that countries now subject to it would introduce their own similar schemes. Related article
      Europe delays travel entry charges until 2025 How do I get one? The cost is currently a non-refundable £10 (just under $12.50), and you can apply through the official app listed on the UK government website, or directly online. The fee will increase to £16 (around $20) on April 9. The apps — for iPhone and Android — boast of being quicker, with 10-minute processing times. Be sure to apply through official channels, rather than through third-party websites, which may charge extra fees, and are less likely to handle your data securely. You will need to upload a photo of your passport, scan and photograph yourself as you apply, upload the photo, and answer various questions about your plans. Applying online takes around 20 minutes and you must complete the process in one go — there is no chance to save as you go. A decision will normally be given within three days, though the government warns it could take longer. You are allowed to travel to the UK while waiting for your decision, if you need to visit urgently; however you must have made the application before you travel. Note that having an ETA doesn’t guarantee entry to the UK. You must still go through passport control and Border Force officials still have the final say over whether you can enter the country. How long will it be valid? Validity lasts for two years and multiple entries — so you can visit as often as you please. However, note that it will be digitally linked to your passport — so if you get a new passport during those two years, it will no longer be valid and you must apply for a new one. Can families get a joint ETA? Everyone entering the UK needs their own ETA, including children and even babies. But you can apply on somebody else’s behalf. Does this mean I can stay as long as I like? The ETA is only intended for short stays of up to six months. I’m just transiting through the UK. Do I still need the ETA? Everyone entering UK soil, even for a quick onward connection, must have an ETA. (This is the same for any travelers transiting through the US, who need an ESTA.) You will not be allowed through passport control to the transit area without one. Does this cover me to enter Europe, too? At some point, to enter Europe, you’ll need an ETIAS — the EU travel waiver, which has been much delayed but is currently slated to start in late 2026. Stay tuned for details as the countdown approaches. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the start date of the ETIAS requirement.",,0.2200087606906891
"When Jason O’Sullivan walked through the door of Jenny McGowan’s accommodation in Nangi, a tiny village deep in the mountains of Nepal, she couldn’t believe it. “I wasn’t obviously looking for anyone, because who are we gonna meet on the top of a mountain in the middle of the Himalayas?” Jenny tells CNN Travel today. It was the spring of 2012. Jenny was a 21-year-old student studying education and making the most of a college-organized opportunity to spend a few weeks teaching English in South Asia. Jenny was volunteering at the school, along with her friend and fellow Brit, Bonnie. When Jenny and Bonnie arrived in Nangi, there was a brief mention of an Australian family coming along to volunteer with their young kids. But Jenny wasn’t really focused on the other volunteers and when they might be arriving, or what they might be like. Instead, she was enjoying the stunning, mountainous setting of Nangi, which is located about 2,260 meters (7,415 feet) above sea level, amid the Annapurna Mountains. Jenny was relishing soaking up a different culture and way of life, immersing herself in the local community in Nangi. “It was very cool,” reflects Jenny. “Waking up in the morning and seeing Annapurna. That was very impressive. And I was really focused on learning about how to teach English.” The night Jason arrived in Nangi, “we lost power, because there was a storm,” recalls Jenny. Jenny and her friend Bonnie were sitting by candlelight in their volunteer hut, when Jason suddenly walked through the door. He was a tall Australian guy, in his mid-20s. His presence was totally unexpected. Jenny and her friend were baffled. “We were told it was going to be an Australian family with a mom, a dad and two young boys. It ended up being a mom, a dad, two young girls and their adult nephew,” explains Jenny. Jason was the adult nephew — an electrician from Brisbane who’d just finished his apprenticeship and, by his own admission, “wasn’t really doing anything super substantial with my life” back in 2012. When Jason got wind of his uncle’s plans to take his family to Nepal for a couple of months of volunteer work, he was intrigued. Then, when he chatted with his uncle about the trip, Jason was persuaded to go along “to do electrical work and repair things,” as he recalls it. Jason’s decision to join the family in Nepal was pretty spontaneous. As Jason puts it to CNN Travel today: “I just thought, ‘Yeah, screw it, I’ll go along for a bit too.’” Jason only realized the extent of the undertaking once the family embarked on the journey from Australia to Nepal. “They flew from Melbourne, I flew from Brisbane. We met up in Hong Kong, and then flew to Kathmandu, and then we got a jeep to Pokhara. We stayed there for a night or two. Then we got another jeep to Beni, another village, and then from there we got a jeep up the mountain to Nangi, which was terrifying, especially in the rain.” The family actually “got out and walked for the last portion” of the journey up the mountain, recalls Jason, convinced driving was “an absolute death trap.” When Jason walked into the darkened volunteer hut, soaked through with rain, Jenny only saw part of his face illuminated by the candle light. They made eye contact, and as he got closer to the candle flame, she registered on his face a look of surprise she imagined was reflected on her own. “I definitely didn’t expect to see people,” says Jason today. “You didn’t expect to see me,” says Jenny. “No, definitely not,” says Jason. In truth, Jason had no idea what to expect from Nepal — not from the volunteer work, from the country or from the other volunteers. “I didn’t really know what I’d signed up for,” he says. “It was all very haphazard, and then we got there late at night. It’s all very kind of surreal, because we just traveled for days to get to this tiny village in the middle of nowhere…” As for Jenny, as she took in Jason that first evening, she was “very surprised and confused.” But she also felt something else: excitement. “So excited,” Jenny admits today. “He was definitely my type, you know, tall, dark and broad. I was like: ‘Who is this person?’” The next day, Jenny was getting to know Jason’s little cousins. They were sweet, and she enjoyed playing with them. But she also took the opportunity to do a bit of digging. “I was asking them, ‘So, Jason, how old is he?’ And they were like, ‘Oh, he’s 26 but he doesn’t even have a girlfriend. He should be married by now,’” recalls Jenny. She remembers thinking this was “good information” to have. As for Jason, he found Jenny intriguing from the outset. “I thought she was interesting,” he says. “The romance bit is hard to pinpoint.” Related article
      A librarian ran off with a yacht captain in the summer of 1968. It was the start of an incredible love story Bonding in Nepal Over the next few days, Jenny and Jason naturally found themselves thrown together. “Playing cards and basketball, dodgeball, football with the village kids…” recalls Jenny. In the daytime, Jason fixed the school electrics and Jenny taught English. In the evenings, they watched movies together on Jenny’s friend Bonnie’s laptop. “It was fun,” Jenny says. “But we didn’t… there was nothing that romantic, at the time.” This was partly because Jenny’s friend Bonnie was usually in the mix too — and usually playing Justin Bieber, whose hit song “Boyfriend” had just come out. “She kept playing one song over and over again because the girls really loved it,” recalls Jenny. “Though I think partly we were playing it over and over again because Jason hated it so much.” There seemed to be something between Jenny and Jason, but Jenny wasn’t entirely sure what Jason was thinking. One time she suggested the two of them stay up late, watching a horror movie, after Bonnie had gone to bed. But Jason just shrugged that scary movies “weren’t really his thing” and went to bed too. Jason and Jenny only overlapped in Nangi for a couple of weeks before she headed back to the UK. There was a wall in the volunteer hut where departing volunteers could write a parting message and leave their email address. Jenny wrote her message and included her email. She figured if Jason wanted to stay in touch, he would. Returning to her home in Bristol, in the southwest of England, was a bit of a culture shock after her weeks in the mountains of Nepal. Jenny found herself thinking about the school, about her pupils. And mostly, about Jason. “I didn’t hear from him for a week or two,” she recalls. “Then, suddenly, I got an email from a Jason O’Sullivan.” For a moment, Jenny thought, “Who’s Jason O’Sullivan?” They’d never exchanged full names in Nepal. But she quickly put two and two together and replied. Soon, Jenny and Jason were emailing regularly, back and forth. They chatted about their day-to-days and filled in the blanks in their life stories that they hadn’t touched on in Nepal. “Then, after a couple months, I was like, ‘Do you have a smartphone? If you do, you can download WhatsApp, and then we can text,’” recalls Jenny. “And I didn’t hear from him for a couple days. And I was like, ‘Oh, maybe he’s been put off by that.’ But then a couple days later, he sends me just a one line email that says, ‘Okay, I have a smartphone. Now. What do I do?’ So he went out and bought a phone so that we could message.” In 2012, smartphones weren’t as prevalent as they are today. Still, looking back, Jenny jokes to Jason that she “dragged you into the 21st century,” while Jason credits Jenny for forcing him to “download my first app.” The two continued to embrace modern technology when they video called for the first time, a couple of months later. By then, it was September — several months since their time together in Nepal. Jenny was anxious in the lead-up to the call, part of her illogically worried “that it wasn’t him, that I’d been texting some random.” “But then we’re on Skype, and soon we were Skyping every single day.” I wasn’t obviously looking for anyone, because who are we gonna meet on the top of a mountain in the middle of the Himalayas? Jenny, on the moment she met Jason Somewhere along the line, it became obvious to both Jenny and Jason that their connection wasn’t just a friendship. Jenny had liked Jason from the offset, and her feelings had only grown in the subsequent months. She’d expected her feelings were reciprocated once Jason started emailing her so often. This was finally confirmed when Jenny, at one point, mentioned to Jason she was going on a date in the UK. Only half-joking, Jason messaged that he hoped it went badly. “Why?” Jenny asked him. “Because I like you,” Jason said. “As more than a friend.” Jenny confided in her mother and sister about her feelings for Jason, and about what he’d said. Her loved ones encouraged her to follow her heart, but Jenny was acutely aware of how far away Jason was. “At that time, I didn’t really see a chance for us to be together, because we lived on other sides of the world, and I hadn’t ever considered moving to Australia. It wasn’t even a place I wanted to visit … I wanted to teach English as a foreign language. And I was like, ‘Well, they already do speak English.’ And I wanted to travel the world doing that. So it wasn’t on my list,” Jenny says. Meanwhile, when Jenny told her friends about her conversation with Jason and about their subsequent decision to be exclusive, her friends told her this was “ridiculous.” “They were like, ‘How can you not see other people when you don’t even see each other?’” Jenny recalls. I didn’t really see a chance for us to be together, because we lived on other sides of the world Jenny, on the long distance relationship But then that fall, Jason and Jenny joined the online ticket line for Glastonbury Festival tickets. It’s notoriously difficult to get tickets for the popular UK-based music festival. But somehow, Jason reached the front of the line and grabbed two tickets. And with that, a plan was formed. Jenny and Jason would reunite in the summer of 2013 to attend Glastonbury together, with Jason planning to come to the UK a month or so beforehand. “Glastonbury was the catalyst,” says Jenny. But things were building to a reunion either way, says Jason. “Pretty much as soon as we were escalating to Skype, I went, ‘Okay, I’m going on a holiday,’” he says. Jason headed to the UK in May 2013, a couple of months ahead of Glastonbury, and planned to stay with Jenny for a few months. “All of my friends thought it was a really stupid idea to commit to living with someone that I’d only known for a few days,” says Jenny. She tried to convince them he really wasn’t a stranger. “I was like, ‘It’s not really the same, because we’ve Skyped every single day for hours,’” she says. Related article
      She couldn’t stop thinking about the man she’d glimpsed when her ship visited a remote island. Then he wrote her a letter A UK reunion and an Australian decision Jason arrived at London Heathrow airport in May 2013, with Jenny’s Bristol address saved in his cell phone. “I distinctly remember I got the bus from London to Bristol, and then a taxi from the bus terminal to this address. And I get out of the taxi, and I look up and Jenny is looking out the window. And it became very, very real,” he recalls. “I knocked on the door, and she came down and answered the door. And I think my first words were, ‘You’re littler than I remember.’” It was bizarre, Jason says, to see someone in person he’d only met once, over a year previously, for a couple of weeks. Jenny felt this too. The reunion was “surreal,” she says. “For so long, for a year, you’d just been someone on a screen and then all of a sudden, you weren’t, and you’re real, and it was crazy,” she says to Jason today. But the two got over this strangeness very quickly, settling into a routine that felt natural. In the end, Jason stayed in the UK with Jenny for nine months. The two rented their own apartment together. By then, Jenny was working as a nanny, and Jason got a job at a home improvement store. On weekends, the two explored the UK together and vacationed in Europe, enjoying some amazing experiences: “Pamplona running with the bulls, Northern Lights in Iceland, Oktoberfest in Germany…” “And we obviously did Glastonbury,” adds Jenny. “We had a great time… Arctic Monkeys was a favorite of mine but I also enjoyed introducing Jason to the giant Yorkshire pudding bowls they had there, filled with roast dinner.” In between adventures, the couple also talked about their future. They decided after their stint in the UK, Jenny would go with Jason to Australia for a while. They figured they would “sort of decide from there who was going to move.” By then, Jenny and Jason were certain their connection was going to be “long-term.” They knew one of them was going to move across the world. Jason left the UK in February 2014. A month later, Jenny followed him to Brisbane. It was an emotional decision. In her heart, Jenny knew this wasn’t a brief vacation. This was it. “I was going to stay,” she says. “We were very committed at that point. We’d known each other for almost two years, and we had lived together for nine months. Unless I hated Australia, that’s where we were going to settle.” The day before her flight, Jenny sat on her living room floor with her mother, an empty suitcase in front of them. “I was only taking one suitcase over,” explains Jenny. She had to be selective with what she brought to her new life. So Jenny held up items of clothing to her mother, and together they decided whether Jenny would pack them, or Jenny’s mother would take them to the thrift store. They were being consciously practical, and then Jenny “just burst into tears.” She was suddenly struck by the reality of her decision. “It was just really real, to think that I was leaving. It was a bit confronting, leaving everything I’d ever known, moving to the other side of the world,” she says. “I didn’t have any friends there. I didn’t have work set up. Literally the only person I knew was this guy. And I didn’t know what it was going to be like, I’d never visited before.” The only thing Jenny knew about Australia, she’d learned from binge-watching the  soap opera “Neighbours” in the weeks leading up to her departure. But Jenny’s mother encouraged her to follow her heart, to give Brisbane a try. And as soon as she arrived and was reunited with Jason, Jenny knew going to Australia was the right choice. In time, she settled into her new life. Within a couple of years, the couple were putting down roots, building their dream home from scratch. “We actually met on April 6, 2012, we bought land on April 6, 2015 and then we got married on April 6, 2018,” says Jenny. “We met on a mountain, and got married on a mountain,” says Jason. The wedding took place in the surrounds of the Australian Glass House Mountains, in the Sunshine Coast Hinterland, in eastern Australia. The mountainous setting was a nod to the couple’s Nepal origin story. Meanwhile, Jenny decorated the venue with UK and Aussie-themed paraphernalia. The wedding was a “party on a hill in a tent,” recalls Jason. This festival vibe felt appropriate given the role Glastonbury played in their love story. It was casual and great fun: “A taco truck and a pizza truck…” recalls Jenny, who took Jason’s name following the wedding, becoming Jenny O’Sullivan. “A band in a tent — muddy, real muddy,” adds Jason. It was the perfect celebration of the next chapter of their life together. Related article
      Two strangers met in Berlin. Here’s how they ended up having ‘three weddings’ ‘Unlikely, but life changing’ Today, Jenny and Jason still live in Brisbane, Australia. Jason works in infrastructure, while Jenny has an online business selling personalized jewelry and handmade gifts, called Roo and Wren. The couple have two young children and enjoy taking them “back to sunny England occasionally,” as Jason puts it. They recently returned to attend Jenny’s sister’s wedding. Becoming parents has been “great, but a lot of hard work,” says Jason. “It was difficult at first as we have no family support with my family in the UK and Jason’s up near Cairns,” agrees Jenny. “We’re so happy with our family, though, and we’ve gotten the hang of it now!” The family enjoy embracing British and Australian traditions — and mixing them up to make something new, such as over the holidays when Jenny says they “have the full British Christmas lunch on Christmas day but we also have prawns and set up our water park in the afternoon in our back garden.” Today, when the couple meet new people, they tend to assume Jenny and Jason met in Australia. It’s not uncommon for Brits to move Down Under or for Australians to head in the other direction. People think they know the outline of their love story. And then Jenny starts talking about the Himalayas, a three-day trip up a mountain and a candlelit first glance. “Every time I tell the real story, I’m like ‘This sounds like I’m making this up,’” says Jenny. It’s now 13 years since Jason walked into the candlelit room and saw Jenny for the first time. “It was extremely unlikely, but life changing,” says Jason of that moment. “I just feel really lucky that our paths crossed,” says Jenny. The couple returned to Nepal together in April 2017, to mark five years since they met. They didn’t return to the village of Nangi, because, as Jason says, “it’s quite the logistical hurdle to get up there.” But it was special to return to the country where they first crossed paths, a place that they both love and hold dear. “And one day we’ll go back up to Nangi, take the kids up,” says Jason. “That would be very cool.”",,0.33286982774734497
"Once home to visionaries such as Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen, London Fashion Week has been synonymous with theatricality and boundary-pushing designs. But increased operational costs and other disruptions in the wake of Brexit, along with diminishing global interest in the city’s designers, whose shows garner a fraction of the attention of those in other fashion capitals like Milan, Paris and even New York, has hampered the mood in recent years. At the event’s kickoff, the British Fashion Council’s outgoing CEO Caroline Rush addressed some of those difficulties in a speech that concluded her 16-year tenure. “London Fashion Week is about making meaningful connections… and cementing (designers’) place on the global stage,” she said. “These are challenging times, but this community is resilient — and as someone who has been there for a little while, I can tell you from experience that creativity is heightened even further when businesses face adversity.” By the next season of shows in September, Rush’s successor, Laura Weir, will be well into the role (she joins in April), marking a new chapter for the sector. “Creativity, innovation, breaking boundaries… that is our role in the fashion industry and one that we are incredibly proud of,” Rush said, adding that London is fueled by “high-octane creativity that you see nowhere else in the world.” Runway regulars Despite the transitional period, London Fashion Week brimmed with unabridged talent and creativity — from cult names, like Paolo Carzana and Dilara Findikoglu, to the fledgling labels (Louther, Nuba and Olly Shinder) showing as part of talent incubator Fashion East. All of which, in the absence of bigger, heavy-hitting brands, had more space to shine. Showgoers held out for a late show by Findikoglu, who returned after a season off, with a collection of body-hugging styles, including a black snakeskin corset worn by supermodel Lara Stone, who opened the show. The venue Electrowerkz — a sprawling warehouse known for its alternative club nights — was a fitting backdrop for Findikoglu’s darkly romantic and subversive designs, which have drawn equally bold fans such as Lady Gaga, Madonna and Doja Cat. Also among the highlights were a skin-colored leather dress covered in intricate scrawls by tattoo artist Jonah Slater, and pieces covered in seashells — a nod to the goddess Venus, who was born in the sea. Also with a late-night slot was Carzana, who drew about 120 people to his show in a cozy pub in Clerkenwell, a neighborhood popular with architects and other creatives. On a digital screen, the clothes can appear raggedy, as if intended to be worn by the cast of “Les Misérables,” but the Welsh designer’s slow fashion approach to hand-making, the use of vegetables, flowers and spice-based dyes, and the acute creativity in his construction, is what makes him a standout among his peers. Popular mainstays, such as Roksanda, Simone Rocha and Erdem, stayed the course and presented collections that were unmistakably true to their brand identities. Inspired by the late British visual artist Phyllida Barlow, Roksanda leaned into odd color pairings, such as copper brown and Yves Klein blue, and vivid artistic prints. Art also typically plays a key role in Erdem’s collections: this time, the eponymous designer partnered with Kaye Donachie, a Scottish painter known for her figurative works, on appliques hand-drawn onto gauzy fabrics, which made the models look like walking watercolor paintings. Meanwhile, Simone Rocha turned to the childhood fable, “The Tortoise and the Hare,” as the starting point for her collection. Some famous faces, including model and television host Alexa Chung and actresses Fiona Shaw and Bel Powley, made a surprise appearance on the runway, some carrying rabbit or turtle-shaped accessories. Rocha’s signature darkly romantic pieces were complemented by a greater range of accessories, from the knitted neckerchief to the silver hardware (including belts, necklaces and earrings) that featured a padlock. Britishness at the fore It was the return of Cool Britannia at brand S.S. Daley, which presented reinvented wardrobe staples such as trench coats, rain jackets, duffle coats, bomber jackets and pea coats to a score of ‘80s post-punk British hits from The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the Pet Shop Boys. The outerwear — the kind you’d see on a drizzly day in London — were not quite weather-appropriate, ironically. Instead, the classic pieces were refashioned in lightweight blue-and-white printed chiffon, tufted felt and floral chintz. The collection was inspired by Scottish Colourists, a prolific group of painters in the 1920s known for their vibrant and confident use of colors, resulting in artworks that were often “quite smudgy and fibrous,”, said S.S. Daley founder and designer Steven Stokey-Daley. Backstage, Stokey-Daley shared that he had especially been drawn to Francis Cadell, one of the Scottish Colourists, who “ventured out to find new color inspiration” — and so he replicated Cadell’s painting of Iona Croft, an island off the west coast of Scotland, on felted pieces. Daniel Fletcher’s debut as creative director of Chinese fashion label Mithridate was a similar masterclass in British heritage. Pastel-hued sweaters were tied and swung over the shoulder, while pinstriped Oxford shirts were styled with leather brogues. On joining “a young brand without an archive,” Fletcher took the opportunity to draw from his own heritage. “I (wanted to) look at that preppy, eccentric way of dressing that is so unique to the UK,” he told CNN backstage after the show. A different format There was also plenty of appeal off the runway, as several designers opted to present their new designs privately, while others hosted events for their communities. Saul Nash collaborated on a collection with athletic-wear maker Lululemon, while Ahluwalia teamed up with jewelry company Pandora on an engraving event. Elsewhere, Stefan Cooke and Grace Wales Bonner (who normally shows in Paris) prioritized in-person previews, while Aaron Esh, 16 Arlington’s Marco Capaldo and Feben Vemmenby of Feben hosted private dinners, respectively. Labrum, Karoline Vitto and Tolu Coker opted for presentations, where people could drop in and see the designs throughout the day. Asked why she had eschewed a show this season, Coker told CNN that a presentation “felt more aligned” with the brand and business. “I’m constantly evaluating how I present and how I tell stories. My practice is very multidisciplinary.” It may also mark a permanent shift, she said. “As a young brand, I think that a runway show every season is not always the most effective way of maximizing resources, which often are very limited.” Coker added that the label will present its collection via a showroom in Paris, and as a semi-finalist of this year’s prestigious LVMH Prize, she will also present her collection alongside the other contestants — a move that will surely give the designer additional exposure outside of the UK. “Paris makes a lot more sense for us because it’s where retailers tend to place orders at the end of the season,” she said. Some designers, including Jonathan Anderson, Rejina Pyo, Molly Goddard and Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida of Marques Almeida have decided to sit the show season out entirely, focusing instead on developing their collections off the runway. Also absent were Chopova Lowena and Knwls, which now only stage shows once a year, in September, demonstrating their ability to run a fashion business without abiding by traditional rules — which is no bad thing at all.",,0.2424740195274353
"In case you missed the memo, “quiet luxury” is still having its moment. Despite expert predictions that people (having played it safe with their fashion purchases throughout a cost-of-living crisis) would soon return to embracing a more individual sense of style, the latest Burberry collection was rooted in sumptuous materials, neutral colors and discreet details — all the hallmarks of “stealth wealth” dressing. Presented on Monday at London’s Tate Britain museum, a stone’s throw from Burberry’s headquarters on Horseferry Road, the British house’s Fall-Winter 2025 show opened with a model wearing a short jacket, riding trousers and scarf with wide fringed edges, all in the same shade of oatmeal. Looks in khaki, brown and maroon soon followed, as did more opulent pieces, including leather trench coats, brocade suits and shearling-lined jackets. The clothes were modelled by a high-profile cast including runway regulars Naomi Campbell, Edie Campbell and Erin O’ Connor, but also surprise appearances from actors Richard E. Grant, Lesley Manville and Elizabeth McGovern, as well as Lila Moss, the daughter of supermodel Kate Moss. The star-studded front row included actors Nicholas Hoult, Orlando Bloom and Kim Cattrall, among others. (Though, it was a literal knight in shining armor — who also features in Burberry’s newest campaign — that stole that show, as he entertained famous guests by taking selfies with them.) Probed by media on the speculation that he might be leaving to join Jil Sander (the Milan-based label that shares the same owner as Diesel), Daniel Lee, who is into his fifth fashion show as Burberry’s chief creative officer, vehemently professed his love for Burberry. “It’s really an honor to work for Burberry. It’s an incredible brand,” he told a small group of journalists backstage after the show. “Things are going well. They’re definitely improving. I think we’re all in a really positive place.” A lot is riding on Lee and CEO Joshua Schulman, who joined in July, to improve the company’s fortunes. Despite being one of British fashion’s biggest luxury brands, Burberry has been beleaguered by plunging sales and profits, costing it a place on the UK’s FTSE 100 index (which brings together the 100 most valuable companies on the London Stock Exchange) last September. Schulman, who is more than half a year into the role, seemed to be in good spirits as he posed for photographs and sat on the front row next to model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and stylist and former British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful. Some of that may have to do with Burberry’s promising start to the year: the company saw a boost in shares after reporting a smaller-than-expected drop in sales over the holiday period. After a botched attempt by Burberry to move upmarket, Schulman outlined a new strategy for the struggling brand in November, which included a greater focus on its key emblems, such as outerwear and its signature check, and a wider pricing structure. Schulman also shared an annual revenue target of £3 billion (about $3.7 billion), but did not provide a specific timeline for achieving that goal. Burberry reported annual revenues of £2.97 billion ($3.75 billion) for the 2024 fiscal year. Continued emphasis on Burberry’s heritage was clearly on the mind of Lee, who shared his fascination with the portrayal of British high society in period dramas. “I would say that probably ‘Saltburn’ (the dark comedy starring actor Barry Keoghan, a Burberry ambassador) was the first movie that kicked me off onto that trip,” Lee said. “I really enjoyed how people lived in this old, incredible mansion, dressed in an eccentric way for dinner and had crazy parties. It was this kind of bohemian spirit (and) energy that I wanted to portray in the show.” Related article
      A quiet London Fashion Week? Not if you know where to look As for the collection’s earthy colors, Lee explained that he had “spent a lot of time over the holidays, walking in nature, in Yorkshire,” where he hails from. That felt fitting for Burberry, which “is an incredible coat brand,” Lee said. “People associate coats with protecting them from the outdoors and the weather. And Burberry is a brand that’s made for being on-the-go, being outside, and being able to (sustain) different types of weather and terrain.” What’s apparent is a feeling of comfort from Lee. Much like the cozy wintry pieces he had on show, the designer also appeared more relaxed than usual — so much so that one might wonder if he has his eye on an exit, or whether he simply feels more at ease in the job. Time will tell, although one hopes for a different outcome to “Saltburn”: a lavish house, with characters stuck in old ways and an ill-fated end. The film is set in 2006, which coincidentally marks the center-point of Burberry’s heyday. Make of that what you will.",,0.25711894035339355
"Lady Jane Grey, a teenage pawn in the power struggles that plagued the Tudor court, ruled England for just nine days and was later executed for treason. Now, researchers believe they may have identified the only known portrait of the so-called “Nine Days Queen” painted before her death. Following the death of Edward VI in 1553, unscrupulous politicians propelled the staunchly Protestant young girl to the throne in a bid to prevent her Roman Catholic relative, Mary Tudor, from becoming Queen. The mysterious portrait, on loan to conservation charity English Heritage from a private collection, shows a young woman clad modestly in a white cap and shawl. According to English Heritage, it was acquired by Anthony Grey, 11th Earl of Kent, in 1701, as an image of Lady Jane Grey. It remained “the defining image” of England’s shortest reigning monarch until 21st-century art historians questioned its attribution and rejected its identity. In an attempt to settle the question, English Heritage worked alongside London’s Courtauld Institute of Art and dendrochronologist Ian Tyers to conduct a technical analysis of the piece, its senior collections conservator, Rachel Turnbull, said in a statement published Friday. A dendrochronological analysis—a scientific method of dating tree rings—of the painting’s panel suggests it was probably used for the artwork between 1539 and around 1571, according to the statement. The panel, which is made of two Baltic oak boards from two different trees, has a merchant or cargo mark on its back that resembles a mark on a portrait of King Edward VI, Jane’s predecessor on the throne. Scans using infrared reflectography show significant changes were made to the woman’s outfit and face after the completion of the initial portrait, English Heritage said. The white scarf around her shoulders is believed to be a later addition. Bands encircling her right arm under the scarf are thought to be possibly part of a larger decorated sleeve that is now hidden, or a now-gone scarf that was previously draped over her lower arms, like the outfits she is depicted as wearing in portraits painted after her death.

      Catherine, Princess of Wales and children share hand-drawn family portraits The linen cap, or coif, covering her hair also appears significantly altered. A coif with a different shape and potentially even a hood, which is a fancier headpiece worn over a coif, can be seen around her face in the scans. The researchers suggested a veil may even have been present at one point before being painted out. The woman’s eyes now look to the left, but they were previously looking right, English Heritage said. In addition to the repainted areas, the subject’s eyes, mouth and ears have been scratched out, defacing the artwork for what were probably religious or political reasons, the organization said. It noted that a posthumous depiction of Lady Jane Grey in London’s National Portrait Gallery shows similar marks. The changes to the painting may have been made in order to tone it down and present the subject as a demure Protestant martyr, it added. “While we can’t confirm that this is definitely Lady Jane Grey, our results certainly make a compelling argument!” said Turnbull. “From the newly discovered evidence of a once perhaps more elaborate costume and the dating of the wooden panel from within her lifetime, to the deliberate scratching of her eyes, it is possible that we are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death. Regardless of her identity, the results of our research have been fascinating,” she added. Related article
      Mysterious portrait of a woman revealed beneath Picasso painting “This is such an interesting picture posing so many questions, and if this is Jane Grey, a valuable addition to the portraiture of this young heroine, as a woman of character—a powerful challenge to the traditional representation of her as a blindfolded victim,” bestselling historical novelist Philippa Gregory said in the release. Jane spent a lot of time at the royal court after her father was made Duke of Suffolk in October 1551. Her Protestantism made her a candidate for the throne for those who supported the English Reformation, like the powerful Duke of Northumberland, who married her to his son and persuaded a dying King Edward to make her his successor. Edward died on July 6, 1553, and Jane, who had fainted when first presented with the idea of becoming Queen, ascended the throne four days later. However, by July 19, she relinquished her crown to Edward’s sister, Mary Tudor, who had the support of the populace, and who was meant to be the heir, according to both the law and Henry VIII’s will. Jane was subsequently charged with high treason, to which she pleaded guilty, and was beheaded on February 12, 1554. She was 16 years old.

"Barcelona’s teenage star Lamine Yamal is continuing to find new ways to impress the world of soccer after yet another dazzling display in the Champions League on Tuesday. The 17-year-old provided a brilliant assist and scored a memorable goal to inspire Barça to a 3–1 win over Benfica in the second leg of its last 16 tie – the Spanish giant won 4-1 on aggregate. It was Yamal again who was the star of the show, with his assist for Barcelona’s first goal demonstrating just how devastating he can be. The youngster picked the ball up near the half-way line before running directly at the Benfica defense. His lightning-quick footwork then deceived two defenders before he found teammate Raphinha at the back post to give the Blaugrana the lead in the 11th minute. After the match, Yamal admitted he had tried to shoot before accidentally finding his teammate, but the build-up before the moment was simply sensational. Nicolás Otamendi’s header then leveled the scores on the night, but Yamal produced another moment of magic to put his side back ahead in the 27th minute. The winger received the ball near the sideline before cutting inside, beating his defender and sending a masterful curling shot into the far corner. His own teammates could barely believe what they had witnessed but nothing appeared to faze Yamal who, as a reminder, is still only 17. “It was a good goal, but sometimes these things come off and sometimes they don’t,” a humble Yamal said after the win. Yamal also became the youngest player in history to register a goal and an assist in a Champions League match, according to UEFA. “His goals simply emphasize what he is – a footballer of tremendous quality,” Raphinha, who scored twice on Tuesday, said of Yamal after the match. Barça, which sits top of La Liga, will now play either Lille or Borussia Dortmund in the quarterfinals. PSG stuns Liverpool Elsewhere in the Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) celebrated a “perfect evening” to knock Liverpool out of the Champions League in a dramatic penalty shootout. The French side, trailing 1-0 after the first leg of the last 16 tie, knew it needed to produce something special to get the better of Liverpool at Anfield and that’s exactly what the Parisians did. Ousmane Dembélé’s early goal leveled the aggregate scoreline before PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma was the hero of the eventual shootout, saving penalties from both Darwin Núñez and Curtis Jones. “It’s a magnificent evening for us, for the club, for its history,” PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said after the match. “It was a difficult match to play here at Anfield, but it is a perfect evening.” PSG, bidding to win its first Champions League title, looked a threat throughout both legs of the encounter and was well worthy of the win. In truth, the French side was unlucky to lose the first leg having dominated much of the match. For Liverpool, who many considered to be one of the favorites to win this year’s Champions League, it was a humbling experience having had its own way in the English Premier League this season. Both Jones and Núñez – who has been publicly criticized by his manager Arne Slot in recent weeks – looked devastated on the pitch after losing the shootout. But Slot tried to see the positives from what was a rollercoaster match, littered with moments of quality from both sides. “It was the best game of football I was ever involved in,” the Dutch manager said after the defeat. “I don’t have the history like Liverpool as a manager, but it was two teams of an incredible level, at an incredible intensity. “I hope and think every fan around the world was hoping this game would just keep on going, it wouldn’t stop, because it was incredible.” PSG will face either Club Brugge or Aston Villa in the quarterfinals.",,0.4628516435623169
"Lawmakers and campaigners in the United Kingdom are pushing for an end to the display of human remains in museums and the sale of human body parts in auction houses. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Afrikan-Reparations (APPG-AR), which is made up of parliamentarians, campaigners and community members, released a report Wednesday calling for a ban on the sale and display of ancestral remains, including Egyptian mummies. At present, the law that regulates the storage and use of human remains in the UK only requires consent for acquiring and holding body tissue from people under 100 years old. The Human Tissue Act 2004 also only prohibits people from buying, selling and possessing body parts for transplantation. The report, titled “Laying Ancestors to Rest,” outlined the distress caused to diaspora communities by British institutions holding ancestral remains, many of which were taken during colonial rule. “The mummified person has historically been traded among the upper classes of Britain and France as a luxurious commodity, also featuring as entertainment in British ‘mummy unwrapping parties’ in the 19th century,” the report said.

      Auction house withdraws shrunken heads and other human remains from sale following outcry “In more recent times, Egyptian mummified persons have been transformed to the popularised, haunted ‘mummy’ figure, which reduces Egyptian heritage to exoticised mystique for the Western audience,” it added. The report made 14 recommendations, including that the sale of human remains should be made illegal; the Human Tissue Act 2004 should be amended to include the remains of people who died more than 100 years ago; the boards of trustees for national museums should be representative of the diasporas in society; and funders should dedicate resources to mapping the inventory of ancestral remains in the UK’s cultural institutions. Guidance for museums and other institutions on how to care for human remains was published by the British government back in 2005. Under that guidance, museums can decide on a case-by-case basis whether or not to return human remains, if requested. During a debate on the issue in the House of Lords, Parliament’s upper house, on Thursday, Fiona Twycross, a junior minister in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, acknowledged that the guidance was dated and “the world has changed substantially” since then. She added that incomplete databases and collections also make it hard to know where human remains are being kept but said the recommendations put forward in the report “will inform the government’s consideration” of the issues. ‘Abominable trade’ In the debate, Paul Boateng, a peer from the governing Labour party, described the trade of human body parts as an “abomination.” “This abominable trade must stop, and the continued retention and objectifying of the remains of Indigenous peoples in our public collections, against the will of their descendants and the originating communities concerned, must cease,” he added. He was among several politicians to praise the “good practice” of the Pitt Rivers museum in Oxford, which removed 120 artifacts, including an Egyptian mummified child, Naga trophy heads and shrunken heads, from display in 2020 as part of its “decolonization process,” because the items “reiterated racial stereotypes.” Professor Laura Van Broekhoven, director of the Pitt Rivers Museum, told CNN in a statement Friday that the museum is “very supportive” of the calls to “ban the sales of human remains and the display of human remains in public museums.” Related article
      Don’t say ‘mummy’: Why museums are rebranding ancient Egyptian remains She added that her museum’s approach “rehumanises our museums and our collections in unprecedented ways, bringing opportunities of true partnerships, that work towards global healing and peace building.” During the parliamentary debate, Boateng criticized the British Museum in London for refusing to hand over several preserved Māori tattooed heads and the skulls of two named individuals from the Torres Strait islands. He added that the museum was “forever seemingly on the defensive and on the back foot” and in need of “long-overdue reform.” Twycross said ministers regularly meet with the museum and that she would ensure that this was raised as an issue. The British Museum holds more than 6,000 human remains, according to its website, which it says “furthers our understanding of the past” and advances research. “The Museum is mindful of ethical obligations and closely follows the guidance set out by the Department of Culture, Media and Sports and the Human Tissue Act 2004 which ensures that human remains held in its care are always treated and displayed with respect and dignity,” a spokesman for the museum told CNN in a statement Friday. Controversy surrounding the display and auction of human remains persists globally. In October, the Swan auction house in Oxfordshire, England, was forced to withdraw more than two dozen lots of human remains, including shrunken heads and ancestral skulls, from sale after an outcry in the UK and India. In 2023, the head of the Smithsonian Institution in the United States apologized for amassing a collection of tens of thousands of body parts, largely taken from Black and Indigenous people without their consent, during the first half of the 20th century. The same year, London’s Hunterian Museum stopped exhibiting the skeleton of an 18th-century man known as the “Irish Giant,” who grew to be 7 feet, 7 inches tall and wanted to be buried at sea to prevent his body being seized by anatomists.",,0.15135489404201508
"There aren’t too many goalscoring records that Erling Haaland hasn’t broken and the Manchester City forward ticked off another one during his team’s 2-2 draw against Brighton on Saturday. The imperious striker has now become the fastest player to reach 100 goal involvements in the Premier League, surpassing the longstanding record held by Premier League icon Alan Shearer. The 24-year-old reached the impressive landmark in just 94 matches, six games faster than Shearer’s previous record, with 84 goals and 16 assists. It has been a hugely disappointing season for Haaland’s Manchester City so far. The four-time reigning champion has been unable to find form throughout the campaign and currently lies in fifth place. Yet while City struggles, its star striker has somehow kept up a blistering record in front of goal. In just 28 Premier League games, the Norwegian forward has scored 21 goals and assisted another three for his teammates. In his first year with City, Haaland scored 36 goals in the Premier League, beating the previous single-season record of 34 jointly held by Shearer and Andy Cole. He then went on to become the fastest player to reach 50 goals the following season, taking just 48 games. Speaking on the BBC’s Match of the Day, Shearer admitted he didn’t know he previously held the league’s goal involvements record, but noted that Haaland’s achievement was very impressive. Saturday’s draw against Brighton was another step back for City in its quest to secure Champions League football next season. Pep Guardiola’s side took an early lead when Haaland scored from the penalty spot but was soon pegged back by a precise free kick from Brighton’s Pervis Estupiñán. Manchester City’s January signing Omar Marmoush restored City’s lead towards the end of the first half before an own goal from fellow new transfer Abdukodir Khusanov leveled the scores just after the break. Manchester City plays Bournemouth in the FA Cup next and will be hoping to find form quickly in a competition that represents the club’s last real chance of winning a trophy this season.",,0.41260942816734314
"Billy Monger was just 17 when his world was turned upside down by an accident that left him fighting for his life. The British driver was competing in a Formula 4 race in England when he collided into the back of a fellow competitor at incredible speed – the collision was so severe that footage of the crash is still hard for his family to watch. The result was initially terrifying, with Monger undergoing a double-leg amputation as a result of the extreme injuries he sustained. In a split second, the teenager was facing a very different future. But spend time with Monger, who is now 25, and you’ll meet a young man with an incredible attitude to life; someone who refuses to follow the script. And, if you ever needed proof of that, his latest achievement provides all the evidence you’d need. In October last year, Monger broke the world record for the fastest double amputee to complete an IRONMAN. He set the record at the World Championship in Kona, Hawaii, considered by many as one of the hardest endurance events in the world. He completed the 140.6 mile course – involving a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile cycle and a full marathon – in 14 hours, 23 minutes and 56 seconds, over two hours quicker than the previous record. The athlete, who also works as a racing pundit and commentator, took on the challenge in order to raise money for Comic Relief, a British charity which aims to end world poverty. “The only time I ever actually think about (my accident) now, is in moments like when I crossed the finish line in Hawaii and I could call myself a world record holder,” Monger told CNN Sports, reflecting on his latest achievement. “You think back to that moment and those dark times and I think it’s just pride more than anything. “I don’t look at it as this negative thing that happened to me and that holds some form of control over my life. That moment, that felt like the end of your world and your world was falling down around you, has actually brought you to this destination where you’re doing this incredible thing.” Monger battled jellyfish stings, exhausting winds and energy-sapping heat to finish the course which winds itself around Hawaii’s Big Island. It’s perhaps obvious, when you consider the distances, that this event is not something you can simply walk into unprepared. For Monger, it was the culmination of a year of training, work which made him more comfortable with being uncomfortable. With the help of expert trainers that become somewhat part of his close-knit family, Monger trained almost every day to get his body and mind in the best possible condition. “The process of hardening your mind and your body to be able to prepare for that happened over that year period,” he said to CNN. “Just bit by bit, it was just as simple as getting up each day and tackling the sessions that I had ahead as well as I possibly could and compounding all those little wins.” Being a double amputee, Monger faced a far more challenging preparation than most. Running, for example, put huge pressure on his stumps, so it was important that his prosthetics fit perfectly. If they weren’t just right, he knew that blisters and soreness could potentially derail his attempt. Then came the cycle, where Monger decided to ride a pushbike rather than a handbike. It meant the former racing driver had to learn the basics over again, notably unclipping his cleats when getting on and off the saddle. It was, unsurprisingly, another challenge he overcame. “You’re aware (of being a double-amputee) throughout the whole process, like there’s no getting away from it,” Monger said. “I’d say swimming was probably the most freeing of the three disciplines because swimming is actually about 80% upper body generated in terms of your speed and your efficiency.” Dark moments After navigating the swim and then the cycle, the dreaded marathon loomed for the 25-year-old. It was, in many ways, a complete unknown for Monger, who never ran that far in training. To make matters worse, competitors in the race are forbidden to use headphones, meaning Monger was left alone with his thoughts. In those dark moments, when the light was fading over the island and he trudged his way to the finish line, Monger was able to fall back on his life experiences. “I think going through something that’s so significant probably opened my mind up to the fact that most challenges that we face in our day to day lives, sometimes we big them up more than they actually are,” he said, reflecting on how the accident in 2017 might have changed him more than he had initially thought. “Like things are doable and you can get through them.” When he crossed the finish line, Monger fell to the road out of both emotion and exhaustion. His family and girlfriend were quickly by his side, overwhelmed by pride. While this was a race run in aid of charity for Monger, it was also a chance to give something back to his family, doctors and friends, who were there to support him as he rebuilt his life as a teenager. But it was also a chance for him to prove to himself that there were no limitations on what he can achieve in life. “I was basically my own car, I was my own engine, I was my own fuel, like it was slightly different to motor racing because I wasn’t having to rely on other people for this challenge,” he said. “The effort I put in was the result I got out and that was something that in this challenge was quite unique, but that I enjoyed.” LA 2028 ambitions Monger could be forgiven for leaving the world of IRONMAN behind, but that’s certainly not the plan. After his record-breaking achievement, Monger said he has eyes firmly set on the Los Angeles Paralympics in 2028, where he hopes to represent Great Britain in the para-triathlon. He has already had positive conversations with the Great British paralympic team and is confident in his ability to qualify for the biggest sporting event in the world. Whatever he does next, though, being a role model and helping to support others will remain Monger’s primary focus. “There’s so many negative things going on in the world around us and it’s hard sometimes to find a bit of positivity,” he said. “So whatever I try to do, that’s at the heart of it. This world record was positive for me and gave me a lot, but also knowing it was for others, that was a big fuel for the fire.”",,0.4617024064064026
"The United States and the United Kingdom looked set on Thursday to be picked by FIFA next year as hosts of Women’s World Cups that will be expanded to 48 teams from 32. Their respective intentions to bid for the 2031 and 2035 editions are alone in the contests after a first deadline to enter the race passed. The first formal bid documents must be signed by the end of April. FIFA President Gianni Infantino told European soccer officials the governing body received one expression of interest to host the 2031 event — from the US with the possibility of other countries in the CONCACAF region joining the project. That long-promised bid would likely include Mexico. Related article
      Netflix purchases US broadcasting rights for next two FIFA Women’s World Cups “We look forward to sharing more details and unveiling our full vision for the 2031 FIFA Women’s World Cup in the near future,” the US Soccer Federation said in a statement. FIFA has just one “valid bid” to host the 2035 event, from the British member federations centered on England, Infantino said at UEFA’s annual meeting in Belgrade, Serbia. “Hosting the first FIFA World Cup since 1966 with our home nations partners will be very special,” English FA CEO Mark Bullingham said. “The hard work starts now, to put together the best possible bid by the end of the year.” The UK’s interest was quickly supported last month by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer when FIFA said it was formally seeking bids from member federations. FIFA excluded Europe from the 2031 contest, clearing the way for a long-expected US win. Spanish soccer officials said last week they hoped to bid, possibly with Portugal and Morocco in a repeat of the co-hosting plan for the men’s 2030 World Cup. It was unclear why Spain did not then meet Monday’s deadline set by FIFA to express interest in bidding. Infantino’s comments to the annual meeting of UEFA seemed to rule out a Spain bid now being allowed. “So the path is there for the Women’s World Cup to be taking place in ’31 and ’35 in some great countries,” the FIFA president said, “to boost even more the women’s football movement.” FIFA is scheduled to confirm Women’s World Cup hosts next year. The 2027 edition with 32 teams is being hosted by Brazil. The Women’s World Cup would return to the US for the first time since the 2003 edition. The US also hosted in 1999. England hosted the Women’s European Championship in 2022 — which the home team won — and the men’s Euro 2028 will be co-hosted by England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Women’s soccer at 2028 LA Olympics In a further boost for women’s soccer, Infantino detailed FIFA’s plan to have more women’s teams than men’s playing at the next Olympics. There were just 12 teams in the women’s tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics and 16 in the men’s tournament. Though the International Olympic Committee strongly supports gender equality at the games, adding four more women’s teams — and about 70 extra players, plus team officials — would push the limit of agreed athlete quotas for organizers in Los Angeles. Infantino said on Thursday that FIFA’s new proposal is to flip the numbers to have 16 women’s teams and 12 in the men’s tournaments. The final decision is for the IOC, which has an executive board meeting next Wednesday.",,0.4150933027267456
"CNN Sports’ Amanda Davies was crowned Broadcast Journalist of the Year at the SJA British Sports Journalism Awards on Monday. Davies was up against the BBC’s Dan Roan, Sky Sports’ Patrick Davison, Sky News’ Rob Harris, Amazon Prime’s Alex Aljoe and Sky Sports News’ Craig Slater. Afterwards, Davies called the winning of the award “really, really special.” “People say: ‘Oh, awards don’t matter until you win them.’ But it is,” Davies told the SJA. “I said it in (the awards hall), the only job I wanted in the world, as well as being mom to my daughter Molly, is to do what I do and to be given the platform I’m given to do the job I do and, hopefully, make a little bit of difference and tell the stories that matter. “And then to be recognized for that after 25 years in the industry, it’s amazing.” The SJA adjudged that Davies’ entry “demonstrated remarkable versatility, underpinned by one constant – a sharp instinct for news.” “Whether anchoring in the studio, reporting from the heart of a war zone, or commanding the stage at a high-profile awards ceremony, she exemplifies fearless journalism,” it said. “She never shies away from asking the tough questions, balancing unrelenting professionalism with an innate ability to connect with people. Her tenacity, poise, and dedication to uncovering the truth ensure she delivers compelling stories every time.” Davies’ submission included a mix of exclusive interviews and breaking news stories from across the globe. That included breaking the news of World Athletics president Seb Coe’s visit to Ukraine – featuring exclusive access to travel alongside Coe to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – as well as being the only person to speak with soccer star Kylian Mbappé when he left Paris Saint-Germain. Davies also reported two headline-making news lines from Cristiano Ronaldo – his belief that the Saudi league is better than France’s Ligue 1 and his plans to go into club ownership – while tennis legend Serena Williams revealed her big plans for the WNBA. “When the big names made news in 2024 – it was Amanda they trusted,” Davies’ submission said. CNN Sports was also nominated in two other categories at this year’s SJA Awards, which recognize the best contributors to the UK’s sports journalism industry. World Sport – CNN’s daily sports show co-hosted by Davies – came third in the best television show category, with Sky Sports News’ Deadline Day finishing first.

"Apple users in the United Kingdom will no longer have access to a key data security feature for iCloud storage: Advanced Data Protection. It’s a relatively small change, but privacy experts worry it could have ripple effects for data privacy around the world. The iPhone maker confirmed last week that it would end access for UK users to the optional end-to-end encryption feature, which helps to ensure that only users can access their own personal data, such as photos and messages. The move was widely viewed as an effort to avoid complying with a request from the British government for a technical “back door” to access user data. Still, the situation could serve as an example that other governments could follow to undermine user privacy, experts say. “This has always been one of our major concerns,” said Caroline Wilson, general counsel at UK-based nonprofit Privacy International. “The fact that the UK government… is setting a bad precedent for other governments around the world.” Apple said in a statement that it is “gravely disappointed” to no longer offer the feature to UK users, “given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.” But the company had little choice, experts say. “Apple was in a very difficult spot here,” said John Verdi, senior vice president of policy at Washington, DC-based advocacy group Future of Privacy Forum. “Folks in the United Kingdom simply will not have available the top level of security that Apple provides elsewhere in the world.” What is Advanced Data Protection? Apple’s iCloud storage service uses end-to-end encryption to protect 14 categories of sensitive data by default, including health data and passwords, stored in users’ iCloud Keychain. That means user data is basically scrambled when it’s stored on Apple’s servers, and only the user who holds the account can access it in its un-scrambled form. So, no one with access to Apple’s servers — like hackers, or even the company itself — could read users’ sensitive data. Related article
      Apple, facing tariffs on Chinese imports, says it will invest $500 billion in US facilities “In the digital world, end-to-end encryption is going to be your best bet for getting a truly private and secure conversation that’s kind of on the level of what you could have in person,” said Joe Mullin, a senior policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Advanced Data Protection, or ADP, extends end-to-end encryption for additional categories of data, including photos, notes, voice memos and iCloud backups (think text messages and call logs). So, in the event of a data breach, for example, content like this would be inaccessible to a hacker since even Apple can’t read it. “One of the very few ways to make sure that your data can’t be leaked if a company is breached is to make sure that the company (itself) doesn’t have it,” said Sarah Scheffler, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Cylab Security and Privacy Institute. UK users will now lose protection for those additional categories of data. Those who have not already enabled ADP are no longer able to do so, and Apple says it will soon provide guidance to existing users on how to disable the feature. There are third-party cloud storage options that offer end-to-end encryption, like NordLocker and Proton Drive. But Mullin notes that consumers are less likely to use them because they’d have to go through extra steps, whereas Apple’s system can back up your phone automatically when it’s locked and connected to power and Wi-Fi. “You kind of need these encrypted services on some level from the people that are making the (operating system) on your phone,” said Mullin. “That’s why so much of the encryption conversation is around what Google and Apple are doing.” Advanced Data Protection will still be available outside of the UK. For UK users, those standard end-to-end encrypted data categories will not change, and iMessage and FaceTime will remain end-to-end encrypted. “It’s a shame,” Verdi said. “It makes British citizens less safe.” The UK fight over data access Apple’s move comes weeks after multiple news outlets reported that British security officials had ordered Apple to build a technical back door that would allow access to the company’s global user data. The demand reportedly came under the Investigatory Powers Act, which lets British law enforcement compel access to communications and metadata from tech companies in secret. Apple has built its brand around privacy and previously resisted building back doors to allow governments or law enforcement access to its users’ information. “As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” the company said in a statement regarding the change to ADP. But without end-to-end encryption, Apple could have access to users’ data, which means law enforcement could legally compel the company to hand it over to aid in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. That may be why Apple believes the move to end ADP in the region will be enough for the British government. “The decision to pull this privacy feature in the UK is an attempt to hopefully not undermine it in the rest of the world,” Wilson said. Apple has declined to comment directly on the British demand. The UK’s Home Office, which is responsible for making requests under the Investigatory Powers Act, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. A broader security threat But even if it makes it easier for law enforcement to access user data, it’s “impossible to provide exceptional access” to data for some parties without “undermining security for everyone,” Verdi said. “Either everyone is protected by strong encryption, or it’s weakened for everyone,” he said. He added that law enforcement could instead seek to access data directly from, with a warrant that compels them to unlock their devices. In the wake of the UK’s move, Verdi says he sees “two possible futures.” In one scenario, other governments could decide they want to do the opposite of the UK and give individuals, companies and government officials the “best security Apple has to offer,” boosting encryption protections. But some governments could also follow the UK’s lead and “seek to undermine security” by  passing rules or making demands that force tech companies to weaken their encryption. “What happens now?” said Scheffler. “This is one piece in a very large puzzle over… the future of privacy, and the future security and the future of encryption.”",,0.18510837852954865
"Britain’s Heathrow defended its decision to shut down operations at Europe’s busiest airport on Friday as the blame game intensified over an 18-hour closure that cost airlines tens of millions of pounds and stranded thousands of passengers. As questions mounted over how such a critical part of Britain’s infrastructure could fail and whether all Heathrow’s four terminals needed to shut, both National Grid and Heathrow agreed that the failure of the transformer was an unprecedented event. But the airport was forced to defend its closure after the boss of National Grid told the Financial Times that the electricity transmission network remained capable of providing power to the airport throughout the crisis. Heathrow said the fire at a nearby substation late on Thursday interrupted its operations, forcing it to shut while it reconfigured systems and switched to power from an alternative substation. “Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted,” a Heathrow spokesperson said. “Given Heathrow’s size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.” John Pettigrew, the CEO of National Grid, said there were two other substations able to provide power to Heathrow, showing that the grid was resilient.

"Donald Trump has repeatedly ignored warnings from businesses and economists against imposing tariffs on imports into the United States. His tsunami of levies has bludgeoned the stock market and wiped billions of dollars off Americans’ retirement accounts. Before the 47th US president, there was another blond(e) with a distaste for economic orthodoxy setting fire to financial markets. The Parable of Liz Truss should be required reading for Trump. A little over two years ago, the then-British prime minister attempted to push through massive unfunded tax cuts, decimating UK government bonds before she was forced into a humiliating climbdown. The episode ultimately cost Truss her job, earning her the title of Britain’s shortest-serving premier and the rare distinction of having spent fewer days in office than it took a lettuce to decompose. Trump’s job looks secure as US and UK government systems are different. The president and his policymakers have also surprised investors with the level of market pain they are prepared to withstand to implement their radical economic agenda. But their tolerance is not infinite, analysts tell CNN. Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, a financial services firm, believes “there’s way too much private wealth tied up in the equity market for there not to be a point” beyond which Trump feels forced to change course on tariffs. “Financial markets are ultimately king,” he said. Trump says he believes tariffs are a silver bullet for America’s economy: a means to boost domestic manufacturing, raise money to eliminate the US budget deficit and cut income taxes, and extract concessions from other countries on trade and other issues. But businesses and economists argue that, instead, import duties raise prices for American producers that use imported inputs and for consumers, while retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries lower demand for American products abroad. Trump has admitted his tariff plan will cause “a little disturbance” and has declined to rule out the possibility of a recession. Last week, Goldman Sachs said there was now a 20% chance of such a downturn in the US over the next 12 months, up from 15% previously. Economists at JPMorgan have also upped the probability of a US recession this year to 40% from 30%, saying in a note last week that “less business-friendly” government policies were partly to blame. Investors, too, have turned gloomier. As of market close on March 14, the S&P 500 index has fallen 8.2% since its record high on February 19. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has cratered 12% since hitting its all-time peak in December. Uncertainty over the direction of Trump’s chaotic trade policy is another downer. Related article
      New CNN poll: Americans are negative on Trump’s handling of economy Target (TGT) recently predicted that Americans will pull back on spending due to a lack of clarity on tariffs, and Kohl’s (KSS) said economic uncertainty was taking a toll on consumers. Delta Air Lines (DAL) went even further, cutting its earnings forecast Monday due to a fall in confidence among consumers and companies “caused by increased macro uncertainty.” Uncertainty “is a buzzkill for the business community and, in turn, it’s a buzzkill for investors,” said Kevin Gordon, a senior investment strategist at Schwab. “We’re hearing verbatim from businesses (that they’re) just not able to make spending plans.” So far, Trump seems unmoved by the market reaction. “Markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down but, you know what, we have to rebuild our country,” he told reporters last Tuesday. Likewise, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that he was “not at all” worried about falls in the stock market. “I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that (market) corrections are healthy,” he told NBC News. “They’re normal. What’s not healthy is straight up.” Trump did not demonstrate the same nonchalance during his first term, said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. That shift in attitude has, itself, unsettled investors. “Markets had expected that the negative reaction of (equity investors) would lead to some reappraisal of (his) policy position,” Donovan said. The Truss turnaround Trump has a twin flame in Truss. In September 2022, Truss began her 49-day stint as Britain’s prime minister with a similarly audacious economic plan: slash taxes by the tens of billions and pay for them by borrowing more, rather than cutting spending. When she unveiled this so-called “mini-budget,” bond investors ran for the exits, worried about the sustainability of the British government’s finances. The selloff in UK bonds, or gilts, drove up the cost of mortgages. Some pension funds that had invested in gilts were pushed to the brink of insolvency, prompting the Bank of England to step in. The market mayhem ultimately forced Truss to scrap her calamitous project. Like Truss, Trump may eventually have to back down — as he has already done with some of his measures. For example, he has backed off from or delayed some of the most severe threatened tariffs, including a 60% tariff on all imports from China (it’s much lower currently) and 25% blanket duties on Canada and Mexico. And last month, he temporarily reinstated the so-called de minimis provision, which allows packages worth less than $800 to enter the US duty-free. Donovan at UBS offers an explanation: “DHL turn up (at your doorstep) and say, ‘here’s you product, but before we hand it to you, you need to pay $30 to the US government.’” “Where the trade taxes are likely to be very visible to voters, President Trump has retreated very, very quickly,” he noted. By contrast, the impact of, say, the 25% tariff on aluminum imports, which came into force this week, is less material for the end-consumer. Donovan estimated that the extra tax could lift the price of a six-pack of beer by 1.5 cents, or perhaps not at all if the cost is absorbed along the supply chain. Markets ‘the ultimate arbiter’ Ignoring the market reaction to policy announcements is a risky bet, not least because that reaction has a bearing on the wider economy. Jack Ablin, founding partner of Cresset Capital, a Chicago-based wealth management firm, believes the stock market will be “the ultimate arbiter” of Trump’s economic policies because it influences all-important consumer spending. Americans tracking the slide in the value of their stock portfolios and retirement pots will feel less wealthy, Ablin said, and rein in spending on non-essentials like vacations and restaurant meals. And Trump could only ignore the negative domino effect on the whole economy for so long. Mayfield at Baird agrees, noting that Trump has many tools at his disposal to calm investors. “President Trump can downshift the trade and tariff rhetoric and focus on things that the market would really enjoy, like tax cuts, deregulation,” he said. Trump’s tolerance for “pain,” he noted — the level of market turmoil he is prepared to put up with before changing tack — is greater than investors had anticipated. But it is not limitless, he said. Echoing Ablin, he added: “I’m a believer that the market is the ultimate arbiter of this sort of thing.” Just ask Truss.",,0.24545098841190338
"The head of fast fashion chain Primark, Paul Marchant, has resigned with immediate effect after he admitted an “error of judgment” towards a woman in a social environment. Parent-company Associated British Foods said in a statement on Monday that Marchant had accepted his actions fell below the standards expected, and the chief executive of the 14 billion pound ($18 billion) conglomerate said he was “immensely disappointed.” Primark has over 450 stores in 17 countries across Europe and the United States, with Marchant growing operating profit from about 250 million pounds to over a billion pounds and more than doubling its store footprint during his more than 15 years in charge. Primark, founded in Ireland and with a huge presence on British high streets, contributes about half of group profit to AB Foods, which also owns major grocery, sugar, agriculture and ingredients businesses. Shares in the parent company were trading down 4% on Monday morning. “I am immensely disappointed. At ABF, we believe that high standards of integrity are essential,” said CEO George Weston. “Acting responsibly is the only way to build and manage a business over the long term. Colleagues and others must be treated with respect and dignity. Our culture has to be, and is, bigger than any one individual.” The group said Marchant’s exit followed an investigation it initiated that was carried out by external lawyers into an allegation made by an individual about his behavior towards her in a social environment. AB Foods said Marchant had “cooperated with the investigation, acknowledged his error of judgment and accepts that his actions fell below the standards expected by ABF.” It said he had apologized to the individual concerned, the group’s board and also to his Primark colleagues and others connected to the business. AB Foods said the group would continue to offer support to the individual who brought this behavior to its attention. Eoin Tonge, AB Foods’ finance director, will act as Primark CEO on an interim basis working with the senior Primark management team and Primark’s Strategic Advisory Board, while Joana Edwards, AB Foods’ financial controller, will act as interim finance director. “It is, indeed, a very disappointing, to say the least, end for Mr. Marchant and all at Primark and ABF, where he has overseen the development of a fine value-based retailer with strong prospects for growth,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. Analysts at Barclays said leading Primark was one of the top roles in UK retail and will likely receive a lot of interest from potential candidates. “But we don’t think Primark are in a rush to fill the void until they find the right person to take charge,” they said. AB Foods, which cut its annual sales guidance for Primark in January, is due to publish first-half results on April 29.",,0.3061835467815399
"Will Timms is a very busy man. The pest controller spends his days criss-crossing Britain’s second-largest city to remove rats, cockroaches and other unwanted creatures from people’s homes. Lately, Timms’ phone has barely stopped ringing as some 17,000 metric tons of garbage have piled up on Birmingham’s streets. “The smell is absolutely unbelievable,” Timms told CNN. “You’ve got rotting food, you’ve got maggots on the floor crawling out of the bags.” Birmingham’s garbage collectors have been on strike over pay, so some of the city’s 1.2 million residents have not had their waste collected for weeks. Mounds of garbage bags, some several feet high, dot the red-brick streets like pins on a corkboard. In the Balsall Heath neighborhood, wind whistles through the puncture marks in one rotting heap where the rats and mice have burrowed in. “That’s a five-star restaurant for them and they’ve got a hotel to go with it,” said Timms. Business is booming — so much so that Timms, who works alone, cannot handle the caseload and has passed some jobs to rival pest controllers. He said the number of calls from people finding rats in their homes has shot up around 50% since the garbage workers’ strikes started. It’s a Dickensian portrait of a city in the world’s sixth-biggest economy — a city that once propelled Britain’s wealth-creating industrial revolution yet, less than two years ago, declared itself essentially bankrupt. “There’s rubbish everywhere, rats everywhere … (they’re) bigger than cats,” Abid, one passer-by in Balsall Heath, told CNN. “This is Britain. This is 2025. What’s going on?” The answer: Nearly 400 garbage collectors are striking over the city government’s decision to eliminate a particular role within their ranks. Unite, the union representing the workers, argues that the move blocks workers’ pay progression and demotes some staff, resulting in an annual salary cut of up to £8,000 ($10,390) in the worst cases. Birmingham City Council disputes that figure and says it has offered alternative roles and retraining opportunities to affected workers. On its website, the council states that “no worker need lose any money” and that the staffing changes are crucial part of its attempt to “become financially sustainable” and modernize its waste collection service. The bitter dispute recently tipped into its fourth consecutive month and has escalated. At first the strikes were intermittent, but in early March they turned indefinite. Only some of the city’s garbage collectors and agency staff are still working, and according to the council, fewer than half the usual number of garbage trucks are currently operational. Some parts of the city appeared to be much more affected than others when CNN visited last week. On Monday, the city council declared that the buildup of waste and the public health risk it poses had created a “major incident” — an official mechanism that allowed officials to deploy extra garbage trucks around the city. The council said that protesters have blocked trucks leaving waste depots, resulting in fewer collections from households. “It is a dangerous job, it’s a dirty job, it’s an extremely physically demanding job … so people deserve to be properly rewarded for it,” Onay Kasab, national lead officer at Unite, told CNN. Shattered finances The BBC series “Peaky Blinders,” about a crime gang set in 1920s Birmingham, put the city on the global map when it premiered over a decade ago — spawning its own tourism industry and bringing the city some sorely needed cachet. But Birmingham is struggling. In late 2023, the Birmingham City Council, run by Britain’s ruling Labour Party, filed a section 114 notice — the local government version of bankruptcy — which halted all spending excluding that on essential services such as education and waste collection. It went bust in large part because an equal pay dispute stretching back many years means it must pay out huge sums in compensation to former workers — most of them women who were paid less than men for similar work. But the council’s mistakes have added to pressures beyond its control. Demand for its services has risen as Brummies — the name for the city’s residents — live longer, while the costs of delivering those services have risen, too. It’s a predicament shared by local governments across the country, with many teetering on a financial knife edge. Britain’s local authorities receive a big chunk of their funding in the form of grants from the central government. But the value of these grants has plummeted since 2010, when the former Conservative government embarked on a decade of austerity designed to shrink the country’s debts following the financial crisis. In England, councils’ funding per resident — including both grants and local taxes — is 18% below its level in 2010 on average, according to a report in June 2024 by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Birmingham’s misfortunes weigh heavy on Timms, the pest controller. “I am fuming (about) the way the city is looking,” he said of the recent garbage crisis. “It’s affecting everybody’s health.” Still, the onslaught of negative news bothers the lifelong Brummy because it obscures the full truth of his hometown. “Brummies, there seems to be like a solidarity (between us), and it’s fantastic,” he said. “I love Birmingham to bits.”",,0.25331440567970276
"Google is being sued in Britain for potential damages of up to £5 billion ($6.6 billion) in a class action alleging the company abused its dominant market position in online search. The class action, filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal Tuesday, argues that Google’s actions enabled it to charge higher prices for the advertisements that appear in search inquiries than it otherwise could in a competitive market. It said the US company, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL), contracted phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser on Android devices and paid Apple to make it the default search engine on iPhones, with the intention of shutting out competition. The claim, filed by competition law expert Or Brook on behalf of thousands of businesses, alleges Google ensured its search engine had better functionality and more features for Google’s own advertising offering than that of its competitors. Related article
      Google’s search dominance is unwinding Google said this was “yet another speculative and opportunistic case.” “We will argue against it vigorously,” a spokesperson said. “Consumers and advertisers use Google because it is helpful, not because there are no alternatives.” Brook said businesses had almost no choice but to use Google ads to advertise their products and services. “Regulators around the world have described Google as a monopoly and securing a spot on Google’s top pages is essential for visibility,” she said in a statement. “Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers.” Britain’s antitrust regulator launched an investigation into Google’s search services, including their impact on advertising markets, in January. The country’s Competition and Markets Authority said at the time that millions of people and businesses relied on Google’s services, which accounted for 90% of searches and were used by more than 200,000 UK businesses to advertise.",,0.27417150139808655
"Prince Andrew’s links to an alleged Chinese spy were detailed in documents released Friday by British courts, which included a statement from a former close aide to the prince about the duke’s line of communication to China’s president Xi Jinping. The 10-page statement from Dominique Hampshire in May of 2024 was part of a tranche of documents released by the courts following a request from numerous British media organizations regarding Prince Andrew’s relationship to the alleged spy, Yang Tengbo. The documents are part of Yang’s appeal of his exclusion from the UK in December, which he lost. Yang reportedly forged a close relationship with the prince and was the co-founder of Pitch@Palace China, which expanded the duke’s Pitch@Palace initiative into China. In a tribunal hearing in December that upheld the earlier decision to bar Yang from the UK, it was revealed that Yang was authorized to act on Prince Andrew’s behalf during business meetings with potential Chinese investors in the UK. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman told parliament in December she took the decision to ban Yang from the UK “because his presence posed a threat to our national security” and was “based on the advice of MI5,” the UK’s domestic security agency. Yang has denied any wrongdoing. Hampshire also said Yang helped Prince Andrew draft letters to Xi discussing the Eurasia Fund, something Yang had described in his written evidence to the tribunal as a way to “upgrade” the duke’s Pitch@Palace initiative “into an investment-type business, or a fund.” He was also tasked with talking to “relevant people” in China, per British press agency PA. “The royal household, including the late queen, were fully aware of this communication – it was certainly accepted and it may be fair to say it was even encouraged – it was an open channel of communication that was useful to have,” Hampshire said in the statement. Hampshire said he met twice with Prince Andrew and King Charles over the six months prior to giving his witness statement to discuss “what the duke can do moving forwards in a way that is acceptable to His Majesty.” Those talks included discussing the Eurasia Fund, according to PA. Buckingham Palace said Friday that King Charles has met with Prince Andrew together with Hampshire over the past year to discuss proposals for independent funding, but Yang was never mentioned. The relationship between the prince and Yang came about shortly after the duke’s disastrous 2019 BBC interview on his relationship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which Hampshire said led to his belief that the prince’s reputation was “irrecoverable.” “This was a common feeling within the royal household, despite what the duke thought may happen. It was very clear internally within the royal household that we would have to look at options for the duke’s future away from royal duties,” Hampshire said in his witness statement, according to British news agency PA. According to PA, Hampshire also said he never saw a “red flag” with Yang (who also went by the name Chris), and emphasized Yang “categorically does not have a close relationship with the duke.” “Chris, of course, doesn’t have the duke’s telephone number or his email address and does not have the ability to talk directly to the duke on his own - ever. This is normal practice and Chris’s relationship with the duke is the same as numerous others,” he said, according to PA. He also said Andrew “fully complied” with advice to end all contact with Yang. Hampshire said in a separate statement on Friday that he left the royal household in 2022 and no longer provides advice to Andrew, according to PA.

"Ilona Maher is among the most popular rugby players, if not athletes, on the planet, and within her fan club happens to be someone who blazed a trail before her. Ruby Tui, a two-time Olympic medalist and Women’s Rugby World Cup winner with New Zealand, has been watching closely as her American counterpart has taken rugby by storm, amassing legions of followers on social media. A little-known entity this time last year, Maher’s popularity soared at the Paris Olympics, where she won bronze with Team USA. Her larger-than-life persona quickly made her the most followed rugby player on the internet, earning appearances on “Dancing With the Stars” and the cover of Sports Illustrated’s “Swimsuit Edition.” For Tui, who spent time in the United States playing in the Premier Rugby Sevens competition, such success hasn’t happened by chance. Rather, it’s a consequence of the time that Maher invests on and off the rugby field. “People think she was just random or an accident,” Tui tells CNN Sports’ Amanda Davies. “Nah, that woman puts work into her rugby, that woman puts work into her branding. That whole USA team really does. “I guess that’s why I chose to have my sabbatical in the US. I was like, ‘How do these guys know so much about just the entertainment world?’ They’re just world leaders at entertaining, and that’s what sport is at the end of the day. “I’m such a fan of her. I’m a fan of anyone who’s willing to put the work in and step up for a cause that they truly believe in, that aligns with their values. And she’s always been a vibe.” In four months, Maher and Tui could both be appearing on their sport’s biggest stage at the Women’s Rugby World Cup in England – Tui as a reigning champion with New Zealand and Maher as a first-timer with the US. The latter only recently switched from seven to 15-a-side rugby and spent the first part of this year with English team Bristol Bears Women, drawing a club record crowd on her first home appearance. The World Cup is now the next goal in the 28-year-old’s burgeoning career. “I can’t wait for Ilona Maher to come over to the 15s game on a World Cup stage and see what kind of storm she can start,” says Tui. “Like, let’s go – I’m keen for all of it. I think more champions, more characters for the game is nothing but good.” Like Maher, Tui also made her name in rugby sevens, winning a silver at the 2016 Rio Olympics before upgrading to gold in Tokyo five years later. And like Maher, she too has achieved internet stardom, delivering an iconic speech after the 2022 World Cup final and leading the 45,000-strong Auckland crowd in song. Soon after, Tui would give her winner’s medal to a young fan who had recently recovered from leukemia and was dreaming of playing for New Zealand. That offered just a brief snapshot into the warmth and generosity of an athlete who constantly inspires, though Tui’s bubbly, eccentric exterior belies her challenging and often traumatic journey to the top of international rugby. Her father was an alcoholic, while her mother, separately, was in an abusive relationship, eventually leading Tui to find a home at a women’s refuge. Not afraid to speak about her difficult childhood, Tui can empathize with others going through what she calls “dark, dark times.” With that in mind, she is supporting a new campaign by Bupa and New Zealand Rugby – “Human After All: The Alternative Team Photo” – which is about normalizing health conversations worldwide. “All I can say is, the journeys you get through and the mountains you climb transform into your purpose and your reason for giving back,” says Tui. “I’ve just seen nothing but good things come from being vulnerable, being open to it. I think that’s why this campaign is so important because we are seen as these physically superior rugby machines, but the truth is, we’re human as well.” Today, Tui is grateful for the way that sport changed the course of her life. She is currently focused on playing for Chiefs Manawa in Super Rugby Aupiki – the top-flight of women’s rugby union in New Zealand – and leads the competition’s try-scoring charts with five. Beyond that, she might be helping the Black Ferns to defend their Women’s World Cup title in England later this year. Tui’s spot on the team is not guaranteed, but even the mention of inspiring her country to a third-consecutive World Cup crown gets her in a feverish state of anticipation. “That sounds juicy when you say it like that,” says Tui. “That sounds like some sort of heavenly dish you get once in your life kind of thing.” It would be a full-circle moment of sorts for the explosive winger, who remembers watching on TV in 2010 as New Zealand won a fourth-straight World Cup against England at Twickenham, where this year’s final will also be held. “Just imprinted in my brain was the huge accomplishment of the Black Ferns, and how super power the Black Ferns were,” says Tui. “And I just remember thinking, ‘Why are these guys not at sold-out stadiums? Why doesn’t every young girl want to be in this team? This team’s amazing.’” To win again this year, New Zealand will have to overcome a dominant and near-unstoppable England team, which hasn’t lost since that World Cup final defeat against New Zealand three years ago. Tui acknowledges that the Red Roses are “well out in front” of their rivals at the moment and “setting the benchmark” in the women’s game. But she is also hopeful that an upset at this year’s tournament could earn the Black Ferns another visit to the British royal family at Buckingham Palace. The team’s last visit ahead of a game against England six months ago took a comical turn when some of the players shirked royal protocol and hugged King Charles, who jokingly said that he had been “flattened by the scrum.” “That was sensational, that was just so out of the blue,” Tui says of meeting Charles, adding that she would love to see him embrace this year’s tournament, especially with the final being held just a few miles west of Buckingham Palace. “I hope he gets amongst it,” she says. “He’s got a really big backyard, he could probably set up a big screen or something, invite all his royal mates around and have a real good time with it, if they don’t want to come to the games.” Two visits to the king’s residence in the space of a year would be a sure sign that people are starting to sit up and take notice of the Black Ferns – just as Tui always dreamed they would.",,0.4103507697582245
"When Robert Macintyre lost the British Amateur Championship final in 2016, he thought his dream was over; he was just 19 years old, and he was absolutely distraught. “I remember pretty much crying the whole way home,” he recalled to CNN Sports, “because I thought I’m never going to get to play The Masters, never going to get to play the US Open or The Open in my life.” Now 28, Macintyre is preparing to play The Masters at Augusta for a third time, and he admits that he was “small minded” to react so fatefully to a round of golf. But he says he’s just so competitive that he couldn’t help it. “If I got beat at something when I was younger, I’d be crying. You wouldn’t believe how competitive I am,” he said with a grin. “If I play a game of pool or a game of darts now, I’m not playing for the fun of it. That’s not me. I’m playing to win.” The soft-spoken MacIntyre is one of the more understated stars on the PGA Tour. Growing up in the tiny Scottish town of Oban (population 8,140) stepping into the bright lights of the American sports world has required some adjustments. “I’m a shy guy,” he explained. “I’m the complete opposite to the Americans.” Related article
      For nearly 50 years, only Black men caddied The Masters. One day, they all but vanished In 2024, he admitted that he’d found it difficult to settle in the US; he was homesick, and he returned to Scotland to get away from the circus for a while. Back home, he says, nobody makes a fuss of him: “I get treated as Bob, the boy that’s grown up in Oban. I don’t get treated as Robert MacIntyre, the golfer on the PGA Tour.” His R&R trip was transformative; within a few months, he’d won twice on the tour. Just as there are two separate worlds that he lives in, MacIntyre also says that there are two different versions of himself. “I think I’ve got two personalities,” he explained to CNN. “On the golf course, I’m very serious. Off the golf course, I’m very chilled out, easygoing, I love a laugh.” The American golf scene is something he’s learned to experience in small doses, “dipping in and dipping out,” of the tour. “I come out here and it’s, ‘Lights, camera, action,’ everywhere, people shouting silly things. I accept that when I’m out here,” he said. “I think I’ve just worked out that the things that annoy me are going to annoy me for the rest of my life in America, and the things that I enjoy, I’m going to enjoy for the rest of my life in America.” I’m crying with joy, but I’m laughing because I didn’t think this was possible. Robert MacIntyre, Scottish golfer, after winning the 2024 Canadian Open. MacIntyre has also had to adjust to the fact that what was once his hobby is now his profession, and he’s had to consciously find ways of falling back in love with the game. At the same time, he’s learned that he needs to keep his guard up because it’s not just his opponents that might get the better of him. “The eyeballs are always on you,” he cautioned. “There’s always someone with a camera to try and catch you out. They’re just looking for that next story. And for me, it’s about not being that next story.” At the Canadian Open in June, his breakout win was such a good story that everybody wanted to tell it. At short notice, he needed a caddie, so he called up his dad, Dougie, a greenskeeper in Scotland. A few days later they were celebrating the biggest win of his career together. “I’m crying with joy, but I’m laughing because I didn’t think this was possible,” MacIntyre said at the time. “This is the guy who has taught me the game of golf and I just can’t believe I have done this with him on the bag.” Six weeks later, he was back on more familiar territory, winning the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond and becoming the first Scottish golfer to win two PGA Tour events in the same season since Sandy Lyle in 1988. That same year, Lyle became the Masters champion and MacIntyre hopes there will be a green jacket in his future, too. “That’s the plan,” he beamed. “It’s one of my dreams. I met (Sandy) for the first time in 2021, lovely guy. I speak to him quite a bit on message and he’s given me a few tips on Augusta. My dream is to win the green jacket, and I think the course sets up reasonably nicely for me.” Like many golfers, MacIntyre has long been seduced by the allure of Augusta National. “It’s not just one thing, it’s everything about it,” he explained. “When you watch on TV, you see the beautiful flowers, it’s just the most perfect setting for a golf course in the world.” MacIntyre makes no secret of his desire to become the best golfer in the world and he knows that he must always be ready to make the most of his opportunities: “One chance, that’s all I ask for, just one chance at a major championship and then, hopefully, it can fall my way.” The small-town boy is making his way on the game’s biggest stage, which is an appropriate metaphor for how he thinks he will succeed. “Golf is a process, so long as I’m achieving my little processes then you get the big trophy the end of the week.”",,0.33101606369018555
"The Duke of Sussex arrived at a London court on Tuesday to challenge the British government’s decision to downgrade his level of taxpayer-funded security while he is visiting the United Kingdom. After Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, announced they were stepping down as working members of the royal family in 2020, the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (RAVEC) decided the couple would no longer be given the “same degree” of protection when in the country. While he no longer uses the HRH title, Harry is still a member of the British royal family and fifth in line to the throne. In a rare visit to the UK since moving to California, Harry, the younger son of King Charles, arrived at London’s Court of Appeal for a two-day hearing for the latest developments in his battle with the Home Office, the ministry responsible for the committee. Tuesday’s hearing appeals against a previous UK High Court ruling upholding RAVEC’s decision as lawful. Upon entering court, the duke took a seat several rows behind his barrister, where he listened to arguments while occasionally taking a sip of water from a bottle in front of him. He is not expected to give evidence during the two-day hearing, and a written ruling is expected at a later date. The duke’s barristers told the hearing on Tuesday that Harry had been “singled out for different unjustified and inferior treatment” by the committee. Shaheed Fatima KC argued that RAVEC did not follow its own policy when deciding to change his level of security arrangements to a case-by-case basis. Related article
      Meghan, Duchess of Sussex opens up about ‘scary’ condition after childbirth She argued that a risk management board assessment, or RMB, was not carried out for the duke before RAVEC made its February 2020 decision and that “it did not apply its own terms of reference to that decision-making process.” She said decisions should have included expert analysis obtained through the RMB assessments, but instead it opted for “a different and so-called bespoke process.” In written submissions to the court, Fatima said the duke “and his wife felt forced to step back from the role of full time official working members of the royal family as they considered they were not being protected by the institution, but they wished to continue their duties in support of the late Queen as privately funded members of the royal family,” according to Britain’s PA Media news agency. James Eadie KC, barrister for the Home Office, told the appeals court’s three judges on Tuesday afternoon that “it was important to emphasize that the decision was not that personal security of the kind previously provided would under no circumstances be provided.” He continued, “But rather that it was simply that that security would not be provided on the same basis as before because of his change of status and because he was now going to live abroad for the majority of his time.” He outlined that the decision led to bespoke arrangements for the duke, which better suited the royal. “We are in territory in which there are no right or wrong answers. There are matters of judgment against necessarily broad and soft-edged criteria … in which the security expertise of those involved is likely be critical,” he told the court. Eadie is due to continue presenting the UK government’s position on Wednesday morning. Part of the court proceedings on Wednesday will be held in private, without reporters in the room, so that sensitive security arrangements for royal family members and other VIPs can be discussed. Harry has often voiced his fears over his family’s safety and has been critical of press intrusion which he blames for the death of his mother, Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris. During the full hearing of Harry’s claim in late 2023, the duke told the court in a statement the UK is “central to the heritage of my children,” Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, and that he wants them to “feel at home” in the UK as much as in the United States. “I cannot put my wife in danger like that and, given my experiences in life, I am reluctant to unnecessarily put myself in harm’s way too,” his statement said. Last year, Harry’s legal action against the Home Office was unsuccessful and the court initially refused him permission to appeal. However, the Court of Appeal agreed in June 2024 to hear the duke’s case following a direct application from Harry’s lawyers. • Sign up to CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls. This legal case was one of several that Harry has undertaken in the UK. In January, Harry said he had secured a “monumental victory” by settling his case over allegations of unlawful information gathering conducted by Rupert Murdoch’s British newspaper group. The duke had sued News Group Newspapers (NGN) – publisher of British tabloids The Sun and the now-shuttered News of the World – claiming journalists and private investigators working for the publications had targeted him and his family between 1996 and 2011. Tuesday’s appeal comes shortly after the prince quit as patron of Sentabele, a charity he co-founded in honor of his mother to help young people with HIV and AIDS in Lesotho and Botswana. Sophie Chandauka, the charity’s chair, accused Harry of bullying and misogyny. Harry said he had resigned “in shock” and “heartbroken.” The UK charities watchdog announced last week it had opened a regulatory compliance case. Harry’s father, King Charles, will not be in the UK during the two-day security arrangements hearing. Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, are on a state visit to Italy, where they received a full ceremonial welcome on Tuesday morning, meeting President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale Palace before viewing a flypast by the Frecce Tricolori and Red Arrows.

"Frenchman David Pereira grew up watching dubbed versions of American TV shows like “The A-Team,” “Happy Days” and “The Dukes of Hazzard” in France. He was obsessed with American culture: he used to collect vintage Mustangs, owns a GMC pick-up truck from the ’70s, and has visited the US nearly a dozen times. This summer, he was looking forward to fulfilling a lifelong dream and visiting Yellowstone National Park with his family, after having completed a successful circuit of national parks on the West Coast two years ago. But after following Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric for months, the 53-year-old business owner said he couldn’t, in good conscience, go through with it and has canceled the trip. “Like many French people, we are immersed in American culture. So we love it. But it’s just unbelievable now,” Pereira, who lives about an hour north of Paris, told CNN Travel. “I kept watching the news and thinking, ‘this can’t be happening.’ It was getting worse and worse. It was just fake news on fake news on fake news.” Similar feelings of disbelief, anger, anxiety and fear that beset America’s neighbors, Canada and Mexico, have spread across the Atlantic, where European travelers are canceling planned visits or rethinking their US travel plans amid the Trump administration’s hostile anti-European rhetoric and tariff war. Safety concerns following a string of plane crashes and cuts affecting the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as stories about tourists being thrown into detention centers without due process or being denied entry possibly because of anti-Trump views, have also heightened travel anxiety. In response, countries like Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, UK, Germany, Finland and Canada have issued new travel updates warning citizens that travelers can be denied entry even with the appropriate visas and approvals, or that transgender travelers must indicate their biological sex at birth in their passports and could face added difficulties entering the US.

      ‘It feels terrifying:’ Why some Americans are anxious about traveling abroad under Trump Chilling effect As cautionary tales of travel to the US began to pile up, British writer Farah Mendlesohn knew that she had to forfeit the month-long trip that would have taken her from Scotland to Oregon, Seattle and Vancouver this summer. Three years in the making, her plan was to conduct research at a public university for a book on a science fiction writer that she was working on, and to volunteer at the sci-fi Seattle WorldCon convention and visit friends. But after reading about a Welsh woman who was detained for 19 days in the US and sent home in chains after being accused of working illegally while on a tourist visa, Mendlesohn canceled her trip and lost £800 (about $1,050) in travel bookings. She also feared that her left-leaning political stance (she edited a deliberately provocative 2007 sci-fi anthology titled “Glorifying Terrorism” to challenge sweeping British anti-terror laws in 2006) would have gotten her into trouble at the border. “As well as my own political views, I don’t think I want to go to America in those circumstances and put money into the American economy,” Mendlesohn said. On Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to minimize concerns international travelers may have of coming to the US and being detained, saying those who are flagged at the border are flagged “for a reason.” “If you’re not coming to the United States to join a Hamas protest, or to come here and tell us about how right Hamas is, or … stir up conflict on our campuses and create riots in our streets and vandalize our universities, then you have nothing to worry about,” he told reporters in Brussels. But the chilling effect among international travelers is starting to bear out in the numbers. New figures from the National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) show that overseas international arrivals for the month of March dropped 12% compared to the same period last year. That figure excludes arrivals from Canada and Mexico. After forecasting a 5% dip for inbound travel to the US this year in February, travel forecasting group Tourism Economics has revised its projections, telling CNN Travel that it now expects that figure to almost double to 9.4%. Summer hotel bookings from European travelers for Accor properties in the US are also down a whopping 25%, CEO Sébastien Bazin said in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV. Accor hotel brands include Fairmont, Ibis, Novotel, Mercure and Raffles. Jean-François Rial, CEO of France’s leading luxury tour operator Voyageurs du Monde, said that ever since Trump’s inauguration in late January, bookings for US travel among his wealthy French clients have dropped a “colossal” 20%. “In the 30 years I’ve been in this business, I’ve never seen anything like this for any destination. It’s huge,” he told CNN Travel. Rial also criticized the US government for downplaying the impact of Trump’s policies on international travel, and said that colleagues in the industry in France are reporting similar trends. The NTTO’s 2025-2029 forecast, published in March, projects that total international arrivals will increase nearly 7% this year to 77.1 million, spike another 10% in 2026 for the World Cup, and then dip down to a 6% increase in 2027 — numbers that seem overly optimistic, Rial said. “When the US says there’s no impact on travel sales from the Europeans to the US, they’re wrong. There you go. They’re talking nonsense.” CNN Travel reached out to NTTO for comment on the forecast but didn’t hear back. The NTTO forecast is based on travel and economic trends through the end of 2024. ‘We’ve never seen this kind of turnaround’ Didier Arino, general director of travel consulting firm Protourisme in France, also said that anti-Trump sentiment has led to an “unprecedented” drop in interest for travel to the US, which is the leading long-haul destination among French tourists. “It’s unheard of. It’s happened before in a country at war, in a county where there was a security risk, or risk of health crisis, but in a normal situation, we’ve never seen this kind of turnaround,” Arino said. British long-haul carrier Virgin Atlantic has recently warned that demand for transatlantic travel to the US has slowed. The NTTO’s 2025-2029 forecast of a nearly 3% increase in Canadian tourist arrivals in 2025 is also at odds with recent stats showing a decline in Canadian travel to the US. According to figures from US Customs and Border Protection, the average number of daily travelers crossing the Canada-US land border by car fell 15% in February from 92,983 to 79,407 this year compared to the same period last year. Likewise, transborder air travel from Canada to the US was down 2% in February, marking the first month to record a year-over-year decrease since the start of the pandemic. And flight bookings between Canada and the US for travel between April to September show a precipitous drop of more than 70% compared to the same period last year, according to aviation analytics company OAG. But while Canada’s largest airlines Air Canada and WestJet have axed seats in response to plummeting demand, OAG chief analyst John Grant said there have been no significant adjustments from Europe or other international markets so far, mostly due to the logistical challenges that presents. And while airlines may try to stimulate demand by lowering prices, he pointed out that the days of post-pandemic revenge spending are over. “Let’s not forget that the vast majority of tourism in the United States is still domestic tourism,” he added. “And if that holds, the loss of a few million people from Europe could be absorbed.” ‘Wrong on so many levels’ A grassroots boycott movement that started in Canada is also gaining momentum in Europe, with “boycott USA” groups on Facebook from countries like Denmark, which leads the charge at 95,000 members, Germany, Italy, France, UK, Norway and Sweden attracting new members daily. For Swede Johan Björnsson, canceling his 2026 cruise out of Miami is an important gesture, even if it means losing a $500 deposit. He’s never been particularly political, Björnsson said. But the moment he saw clips of Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, the 43-year-old said he knew he had to take a stand. “It had nothing to do with politics, it was just a crude assault. It was disrespectful and wrong on so many levels. It got personal,” he said. “That was probably the drop that made everything go over for me.” For Europeans living close to the war in Ukraine, the threat of Russian aggression across the continent looms in the background. Last month, the EU Commission urged its 450 million citizens to stockpile enough food, water and essentials for 72 hours in the event of emergencies like cyberattacks, climate disasters, disease and also geopolitical conflicts. “Peace and stability are intrinsic to the European project. Yet, Europe faces a new reality, marked by growing risks and deep uncertainty,” read the first lines of the EU’s 18-page European Preparedness Union Strategy. Trump’s alignment with Putin, suspension of aid to Ukraine and the administration’s general anti-Europe rhetoric are seen as deep betrayals across the continent. In a leaked Signal thread published by The Atlantic, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.” And during a visit to Greenland, a semiautonomous territory in the kingdom of Denmark, last week Vance upbraided Denmark, saying they have “not done a good job” for the people of Greenland, in a speech that was largely viewed as hostile and insulting. “We consider the US to be our best friend,” said Jacob Bøll, a consultant who lives in Copenhagen. “Now, we’re not only not friends anymore, it’s like our friend started a fist fight with us.” The turn of events has driven Bøll, 52, to cancel travel plans to Cincinnati where he was to visit close family friends this summer, and then travel to Nashville. He was also planning to attend the World Cup soccer tournament next year, but now will only go on the condition Denmark plays in Canada if they qualify. “I just can’t imagine a scenario where I would go back,” he said. “You vote with your feet when you’re a consumer.” After much deliberation, fellow Dane Robert Christiansen has also canceled plans to fly to Texas this summer and surprise his teenage daughter, who is studying in Dallas. But Christiansen said fears of flight safety and his own activity on social media, where he shares the latest news stories as his small act of resistance, would have made him anxious about his travels. “I cannot trust the government of the United States,” Christiansen said.",,0.3646450638771057
"Amoako Boafo is in a buoyant mood. The 40-year-old Ghanaian painter is about to open his first London show, “I Do Not Come to You by Chance,” at a UK outpost of the American mega-gallery, Gagosian. It’s an exhibition showcasing a new body of figurative paintings –– joyful, empowering portrayals of Black men and women, wrought in his distinctive lionized style and pairing fingertip-painting with paper-transferred patterns and blocks of color. In one, a woman stands, hands on hips, draped in white lace; another depicts Boafo himself, on a bicycle, clad in gold chains and chintz. Eshewing a conventional “white-cube” gallery setting, sections of the space are covered in patterned wallpaper. More strikingly, one room is filled with a life-size recreation of the courtyard at Boafo’s childhood home in Ghana’s capital, Accra. “The idea of bringing the courtyard situation to London is me bringing home with me,” said Boafo over Zoom. “The courtyard is a space where I got to learn about almost everything: how to take a bath, how to take care of yourself,; how to sit quietly and listen, how to be disciplined.” Boafo’s rise to art-world stardom has been swift and significant. In 2018, as he was finishing a Master of Fine Arts degree at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in Austria, American artist Kehinde Wiley found his art on Instagram. “He suggested my work to his galleries,” said Boafo, “which was when things started picking up.” By December 2021, one of his paintings, “Hands Up,” had sold for over 26 million Hong Kong dollars ($3.4 mililon) at Christie’s, setting an auction record for his work. Along the way, there was a residency at the Rubell Museum in Miami, owned by renowned collectors Don and Mera Rubell. Boafo signed with galleries in Los Angeles (Roberts Projects) and Chicago (Mariane Ibrahim). “Then Dior happened,” he said, referencing his collaboration with the French fashion house on its Spring-/Summer 2021 menswear collection, “and it didn’t slow down.” Three of Boafo’s paintings were even sent into space –– on exterior panels of a Blue Origin rocket. “I realized that maybe (my career is) never going to slow down –– and it never did.” Unexpected learnings Boafo was born in Accra in 1984; his father died when he was young and he was raised by his mother, who worked as home help, cooking and cleaning for different families. He developed a childhood love of art. “It was one of the ways that kids in the community got together: to draw,” he recalled. “I had always wanted to go to art school but, because of financial difficulties, I did not manage to.” Instead, Boafo ended up on the tennis court and played semi-professionally for several years, until a man Boafo’s mother worked for offered to pay his first tuition fees for Ghanatta College of Art and Design in Accra. The four-year course taught him to draw and to paint. But he also took lessons from the tennis court: “not to sit idle; whatever happens, you move,” said Boafo. He moved to Vienna, went back to school and developed the painterly “language” that has since made global waves. “He was confronting the ideology that art history has to be within a Eurocentric form,” said French-Somali gallerist Mariane Ibrahim, who supports emerging artists of African descent across galleries in Chicago, Mexico and Paris. “To purposely deconstruct traditional portraiture and figuration was really an act of rebellion, but also an act of making and creating your own history. I felt a connection in our experiences: being away from home in a place that doesn’t have much of an African- diaspora community.” Today Boafo sits front and center of an art-world reappreciation of Black figuration. “He’s the head of a locomotive of a new generation of painters from West Africa and beyond,” said Ibrahim. The subjects of his paintings are his friends and family, and, frequently, himself, because, Boafo said, “I don’t see why I should not be present when I am representing my people.” Impact beyond art The paintings are a visual representation of Boafo’s desire to slow down and take stock. He hopes to work on one more exhibition with a similar theme in a different location –– “and then I will step away from making paintings for shows,” he said, continuing to explain that “I want to take a bit of break because I have other projects that I am passionate about –– like architecture and tennis. I want to build my own tennis academy, to develop (sports initiatives) so that the youth have something to do.” At Gagosian in London, the new self-portraits –– including one of his largest paintings to date, in which Boafo reclines on a bed, swathed in floral patterns and surrounded by plants –– have an added poignancy. They act as “a reminder of the things that I want to do,” he said. “It’s a reminder to take a break and do yoga. Take a break and go on a bike ride. Take a break and look pretty and beautiful. Take a break and, sometimes, just stay home and relax.” With his work now held in major museum collections, from London’s Tate and the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris to New York’s Guggenheim and the Hirshhorn in Washington, D.C., Boafo has become something of a local celebrity in Accra. “Sometimes you wake up in the morning and you have 10, 15 people at your door waiting to talk to you,” he said. “Everybody wants to put their problems in front of you. There’s some joy (in it) and there’s some stress.” He is enmeshed in the local community through his dot.ateliers initiative — an artists’ residency, launched in 2022, that has since expanded to host writers and curators. Crucially, it offers spaces that foster experimentation and allow participants “to evolve or think on (their) own”, he said, adding: “I imagine dot.ateliers to be an institution which should live beyond me.” Related article
      Dior partners with Ghanaian artist Amoako Boafo for a stunning new collection Working alongside other creatives is key to Boafo’s practice. He frequently collaborates with Glenn DeRoche, the architect behind the courtyard constructed in London, a sculptural installation that also houses some of Boafo’s paintings. “It was the perfect opportunity to pair what we both enjoy: working within communities, but also storytelling through what we create,” said DeRoché, sitting in the middle of the reimagined Accra courtyard, which has been reinterpreted and abstracted in a charred black timber structure. “I thought it was a beautiful way to start the show, with the seed of Amoako’s creativity, his ancestral birth home, but also to tell a story about community.” Boafo may soon be shifting his creative focus, but the act of painting is a constant. “I’m always going to paint,” he said. “It makes me feel good. I will not be making paintings for gallery exhibitions. I’m just going to be painting for myself, to keep reminding myself of where I am and where I want to be –– you know, taking care of me.” “I Do Not Come to You by Chance,” at Gagosian in Grosvenor Hill, London, is showing from April 10 to May 24, 2025.",,0.4058484733104706
"Editor’s Note: This story contains graphic descriptions of alleged violence and abuse. Social media influencer and self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate has been accused of holding a gun to a woman’s head and threatening “there’ll be hell to pay,” according to UK court documents , Britain’s PA Media news agency reported. Four women have accused the professional kickboxer-turned-internet demagogue of rape, in a historic UK civil suit. It came on the heels of an investigation led by the country’s Crown Prosecution Service, which declined to formally prosecute Tate, in 2019. CNN has reached out to the four women’s lawyers for comment. One of the four women accused Tate of having grabbed her by the throat, whipped her with a belt and pointed a firearm at her face, in 2015, according to PA, citing court documents submitted to the country’s High Court – a claim that Tate rejects. Tate, a professional kickboxer-turned-internet demagogue “would strangle her or grab her by her throat if she spoke back to him or said anything that he did not like… Until she told him that she loved him or apologised for whatever he demanded at the time.” He “had weapons, including firearms, which were often pointed at her,” the court papers lawsuit revealed, adding that Tate “indicated to her that he would like to kill someone if he could.” Related article
      Andrew Tate’s Muslim fanbase is growing. Some say he’s exploiting Islam for internet popularity In response to the woman’s allegations, Tate’s legal team claimed her testimony was “fabrication” and a “pack of lies.” Tate’s solicitor, Andrew Ford, “vehemently denied” the allegations in a statement to CNN on Thursday. Ford said the accusations against his client would be “fully contested in court.” “The claims, including the reference to a firearm, were thoroughly investigated by the police at the time. No firearm was recovered during police searches,” the statement added. “When the matter was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, they concluded there was insufficient prospect of conviction and chose not to charge Mr Tate with any offence.” A spokesperson for Tate also told CNN that the social media influencer “categorically denies these unproven and untested allegations.” “Specifically, he denies ever threatening anyone with a firearm, engaging in non-consensual acts, or subjecting any individual to physical or psychological harm,” the spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday. A fierce proponent of male dominance, female submission and wealth, Tate, has amassed millions of male followers by touting aggressive speech online. Over recent years, he and his brother, Tristan, have found themselves at the center of several criminal probes spanning Romania, the US and the UK, including for allegations of  sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Most recently, Tate’s ex-girlfriend accused him of sexual assault and battery in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles, in March. Both siblings have denied all allegations. The manosphere In the UK court papers published Thursday, one of the women said Tate and his brother “played good cop and bad cop to manipulate her.” A second woman, who also said she worked for Tate’s webcam business, alleged that Tate strangled her during sex without her consent. The 38-year-old former fighter allegedly choked her with his arm “so frequently it became normal,” the documents claim. On one occasion, Tate “threatened to “beat the sh*it out of’ her,” according to the  lawsuit, after which she was “forced to barricade herself inside the bathroom.” Lawyers representing Tate said he “did not abuse” the woman during sex and “if he had done it beggars belief, they had consensual sex on so many occasions.” Tate called the allegations levied by all four women “false,” adding that they “were not controlled.” Rights advocates have warned against the Tate brothers’ rising tide of influence among young boys and men within the manosphere – a digitized space that promotes male supremacy, anti-feminism and “red pill” culture. His virulent material once led to a ban on almost every social media platform. But when tech mogul Elon Musk took over X, then known as Twitter, in 2022, he reinstated his account. Musk is now a high-profile adviser to US President Donald Trump – of whom Tate is an ardent supporter. He wrote in a post on X on March 30: “Young men idolize me because their fathers taught them nothing but to tolerate endless henpecking from their wives. “Men don’t want to be bossed around by females their entire existence,” the post continued . “Resisting female power is ground zero for the battle against The Matrix.” One of the women in the UK civil suit alleged that Tate branded himself as the “mafia” and the “messiah.” On one occasion, she said the influencer allegedly drove her to a field and “demanded that she list 10 things that ‘made him a man.’” The same woman accused Tate of “debating whether to rape you or not,” before having non-consensual sex with her in 2013, while saying “who do you belong to?” A fourth woman alleged that Tate used phrases such as “I own you.” In one alleged assault dating back to 2014, she said Tate strangled her so much during sex that she passed out. In Bucharest, the pair were charged with human trafficking and forming an organized criminal gang, according to Romanian prosecutors. Tate has also been charged with rape. Then, in a separate case, announced in August, Romanian authorities searched one of the Tate residences as part of a new investigation into forming an organized crime group, human trafficking of children and adults, sexual acts with a child, and money laundering. That investigation has not yet let to an indictment.",,0.28761082887649536
"Mohamed Salah has signed a new contract with Liverpool to keep him at the club beyond the current season, the team announced on Friday. The two-year deal puts an end to the long-running debate around Salah’s future at Liverpool, with the Egyptian forward’s previous contract set to expire in the summer. In September, Salah said that his time at the club could soon be coming to an end with no one talking to him about signing a new contract. However, he is now set to extend his time at Liverpool into a ninth year having enjoyed excellent form this season, scoring 32 goals in 45 appearances for the Premier League’s leading side.

Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football. “It’s great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it’s going to be 10. Enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I had the best years in my career.” The 32-year-old joined Liverpool from AS Roma in 2017 and has gone on to become a hugely popular figure at the club, scoring 243 goals across 394 appearances and winning three golden boot awards as the Premier League’s top scorer. He is set to win the accolade for a fourth time this season with 27 goals – six more than Manchester City’s Erling Haaland in second – as Liverpool sits 11 points clear at the top of the table during manager Arne Slot’s first season in charge. Triumphing in the league this year would be the second Premier League title of Salah’s career, adding to the Champions League, FA Cup and two League Cup trophies he has won with Liverpool. “He’s shown at this club for so many years in a row now how much value he has for the team, for the club,” Slot told reporters on Friday. “Like, I assume, all the fans and his teammates, we are all very happy that he extended for two more years.” He added: “I don’t think that it’s a surprise to you that I knew a bit better how his contract situation went over the course of the whole season. Maybe for the fans it was a pleasant surprise – I knew for a little bit longer of course that things were heading in the right direction.” Two of the club’s other key players – defenders Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold – are also out of contract this summer, with Alexander-Arnold reportedly linked with a move to Real Madrid.

"The UK government took effective control Saturday of Britain’s last remaining factory that makes steel from scratch from its Chinese owners, after lawmakers approved an emergency rescue. Prime Minister Keir Starmer summoned lawmakers for the unusual Saturday sitting, only the sixth since World War II, to back a bill primarily aimed at blocking British Steel’s Chinese owners, Jingye Group, from closing the two massive blast furnaces at its Scunthorpe plant in the north of England that are key in the steelmaking process. The bill, which was debated over several hours and which is now law after being given royal ascent by King Charles III, gives Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds the power to direct the company’s board and workforce, ensure its 3,000 workers get paid and order the raw materials necessary to keep the blast furnaces running. Jingye has said the Scunthorpe plant is losing 700,000 pounds ($910,000) a day as a result of challenging market conditions and increased environmental costs. The recent decision by US President Donald Trump to impose a 25% tariffs on imported steel hasn’t helped. After the House of Commons passed the bill on a voice vote, Starmer arrived in Scunthorpe to meet workers, who were clearly relieved that the town’s steelmaking heritage, which stretches back around 150 years, has been preserved. “You and your colleagues for years have been the backbone of British Steel, and it’s really important that we recognize that,” Starmer said. “It’s your jobs, your lives, your communities, your families.” The relief in the town was evident during the interval of Scunthorpe United’s soccer match, where the crowd at the Attis Arena cheered on a few dozen steelworkers on the field of play. The team is known as “The Iron,” a fond reflection of the town’s identity. Related article
      Major steel project in JD Vance’s hometown on a list of Trump cuts to manufacturing industry Starmer had been under pressure to act after Jingye’s recent decision to cancel orders for the iron pellets used in the blast furnaces. Without them and other raw materials, such as coking coal, the furnaces would likely have to shut for good, potentially within days, as they are extremely difficult and expensive to restart once cooled. That would mean the UK, which in the late 19th century was the world’s steelmaking powerhouse, would be the only country in the Group of Seven industrial nations without the capacity to make its own steel from scratch rather than from recycled material, which use greener electric arc furnaces rather than blast furnaces. The repercussions would be huge for industries like construction, defense and rail and make the country dependent on foreign sources for so-called virgin steel, a vulnerability that lawmakers from all political parties balked at. “We could not, will not and never will stand idly by while heat seeps from the UK’s remaining blast furnaces without any planning, any due process or any respect for the consequences, and that is why I needed colleagues here today,” Reynolds told lawmakers. Reynolds criticized Jingye for making “excessive” demands of the government in discussions in recent months, and that without the government’s intervention, the company would have “irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel.” Though the legislation does not transfer ownership of the plant to the state, Reynolds conceded it was a future possibility. It’s unclear what role Jingye, owner of British Steel since 2020, will have in the day-to-day running of the steelworks. But should it fail to abide by the new laws, the company and its executives could face legal sanctions.",,0.1799100935459137
"A British man has died after falling from a viewing platform at a famed Roman aqueduct in the Spanish city of Segovia. Emergency services were called after the 63-year-old man suffered a fall at around 1 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET) on Saturday, according to a statement from the Castile and León regional government. Attempts to resuscitate the man were unsuccessful and he was declared dead at the scene, according to the statement. The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office confirmed the man’s death to CNN in a statement Monday. “We are supporting the family of a British national who has died in Spain and are in contact with the local authorities,” said a spokesperson. CNN has contacted the Segovia city council for comment. Segovia is located around 40 miles northwest of the Spanish capital Madrid, in the center of the country. It is a popular tourist destination that draws visitors keen to see the Roman aqueduct, which was built under Emperor Trajan, who ruled from 98–117.

"UK police have seized a 4-foot-long caiman – a carnivorous reptile native to Central and South America – during a drugs raid in Essex, the force said on Friday. Officers found the animal at a property in Aveley, a small town in Essex on the outskirts of Greater London. They also seized a “significant cannabis grow” as well as several weapons including knives, and arrested two people, police said in a statement. A 36-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of producing cannabis, contravening the dangerous wildlife act and possessing an offensive weapon. And a 35-year-old woman was arrested on the same charges and also on suspicion of possessing with intent to supply drugs. Both of them were later released under investigation. “Drugs cause misery in our communities and we work hard to tackle their production and sale. We know this matters to the public and we value our neighbourhoods so these issues matter to us,” inspector Dan Selby, from the Grays Neighbourhood Policing Team, said in the statement. Caimans, which resemble small crocodiles and can measure up to 5 feet in length, normally live in the rivers and wetlands found in central and southern America. Police released a photo of this caiman pictured in a makeshift tank, and entrusted the animal to the RSPCA, Britain’s largest animal welfare charity.",,0.3004455268383026
"Britain’s parliament is only recalled at times of national crisis. But when lawmakers were brought back from their Easter vacation last weekend, the cause was not a war, terror attack or the death of a monarch – but the potential closure of a steel plant in northern England. The government said the owner of the British Steel complex in Scunthorpe, the Chinese company  Jingye, was prepared to cancel orders for the raw materials needed to keep its blast furnaces burning, a step that would leave Britain unable to make virgin steel for the first time since the Industrial Revolution. Parliament voted to take emergency control of the plant – and even reportedly used the police to deny Jingye staff entry to the site. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has said full nationalization of the plant is “likely,” meaning the government could soon have to run a complex and costly manufacturing operation – a task it has long outsourced to private, and often foreign, companies. Once a steel giant, Britain is now a minnow. It accounts for just 0.3% of global output and imports large quantities of the alloy to meet domestic demand. But the government’s hasty decision to take back control of the Scunthorpe plant, owned by Jingye since 2020, offers a snapshot of how countries like Britain are navigating an economically uncertain world: on the one hand, remaining committed to the globalization that US President Donald Trump is challenging; on the other, protecting industries that are judged too strategically important to leave to market forces. British Steel has changed ownership many times since it was privatized in the 1980s, but Jingye’s tenure has been particularly rocky. A glut of Chinese steel in the global market put pressure on the UK steel industry, where overheads, especially energy prices, are far higher than elsewhere. In March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe plant was losing £700,000 (around $926,000) a day, despite huge investment, making it “no longer financially sustainable.” Negotiations with the British government to keep British Steel afloat eventually failed. In an emergency debate in parliament on Saturday, Reynolds implied the company was prepared to sabotage the plant. “Its intention was to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders” of iron ore and coal needed to keep the two furnaces running, he said, which would “have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steelmaking at British Steel.” Because firing a cooled furnace back up is difficult and extremely expensive, Reynolds said the government could not “stand idly by while the heat seeps” from the United Kingdom’s last blast furnaces. After the British government took emergency control of the furnaces, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, on Monday said that Beijing hoped that Chinese companies investing in the UK would be treated “in a fair and just manner.” The British government gave a range of reasons for its intervention, which speak to the contradictory demands it is juggling. “What we’re seeing, I think, is incoherent reactions to events, in a context where the Labour government wants to appear to be more nationalistic,” David Edgerton, professor of modern British history at King’s College London, told CNN. The nationalistic turn has been some years in the making. Inspired by the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration, Rachel Reeves, then in opposition and now the UK finance minister, dubbed her economic strategy “securonomics.” To prevent Britain being “buffeted by a world that has become increasingly uncertain,” Reeves proposed in a 2023 speech “rebuilding the industrial foundations” lost over decades of globalization. But the takeover of British Steel comes in circumstances not of the government’s choosing. Labour is due to publish its long-awaited industrial strategy later in the spring, setting out a plan for which industries it would protect, and how. The government will find it “irritating” that the steel crisis struck before it could outline its strategy, Sam Alvis, head of energy security at the Institute for Public Policy Research, told CNN. If Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s decision to take control of the plant had a hint of nostalgia (he said steel is part of Britain’s “pride and heritage”), it also reflects growing geopolitical concerns. As the US winds down its military footprint in Europe, steel – used in infrastructure and weapons – will be a key ingredient in the continent’s attempts to rearm itself. Labour’s decision may also have been prompted by shorter-term political concerns. The upstart hard-right Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, has called loudly for the plant to be fully nationalized. With local elections due in May, Labour was wary of the potential fallout over the 2,700 jobs that would have been lost if the plant shuttered. But critics have pointed out that concerns about job losses did not prompt the government to save Britain’s other large steel mill, at Port Talbot in Wales, where the blast furnaces closed last year, costing some 2,800 jobs. The plant is now in the process of transitioning to “greener,” electrically powered steel production. Taking control of the Scunthorpe plant “will set a precedent – and this is why they’ve been so reluctant to do this, either in this case or in the Port Talbot case,” Edgerton said. With other privatized industries also in a state of disrepair – from water to electricity to the railways – other sectors could soon come knocking, he said. A turning point? With full nationalization of British Steel “likely,” as Reynolds said, some in the country are asking whether Britain is turning its back on the economic orthodoxy that has persisted since Margaret Thatcher privatized key industries in the 1980s.

      British government takes over running of UK’s last major steel plant from Chinese owner Jingye Jeremy Corbyn, the ousted far-left former leader of the Labour Party, called during Saturday’s debate for the government to bring “the whole steel industry into public ownership,” making it finally “free from market forces.” But Edgerton cautioned against seeing the decision as “the beginning of a new sort of policy.” “I don’t think economic internationalism is being undermined in this case… because there aren’t going to be any controls on (steel) imports. It’ll just be a question of subsidizing production” at a single plant, he said. The decision also raises questions about Britain’s muddled China strategy. Former Prime Minister David Cameron heralded a “golden era” of British-Chinese relations and famously took President Xi Jinping for a pint in a 16th-century pub during a 2015 visit. But later, under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, relations soured. Despite allowing the sale of British Steel to Jingye months earlier, Johnson’s government in 2020 banned the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from Britain’s 5G network, citing security concerns. In power since last summer, Starmer is once more attempting to court China, although without Cameron’s enthusiasm. Having campaigned on a promise to restore economic growth, finance minister Reeves visited Beijing in January in a fresh push for Chinese investment. But the controversy over Jingye and British Steel risks putting Labour’s overtures on ice. In his comments Monday, Lin, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, warned Britain to “refrain from turning economic and trade cooperation into political and security issues, lest it should undermine the confidence of Chinese companies in their normal investment and operation in the UK.”",,0.17070706188678741
"Syria’s new transitional government was sworn in Saturday nearly four months after the Assad family was removed from power and as the new authorities in Damascus work to bring back stability to the war-torn country. The 23-member Cabinet, which is religiously and ethnically mixed, is the first in the country’s five-year transitional period and replaces the interim government that was formed shortly after Bashar Assad was removed from power in early December. The Cabinet does not have a prime minister since according to the temporary constitution signed by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa earlier this month, the government will have a secretary general. The government that was announced ahead of Eid el-Fitr, the feast that marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that starts in Syria on Monday, includes new faces apart from the ministers of foreign affairs and defense. They kept the posts they held in the interim government. Syria’s new Interior Minister Anas Khattab was until recently the head of the intelligence department. “The formation of a new government today is a declaration of our joint will to build a new state,” al-Sharaa said in a speech marking the formation of the government. Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra said his main goal will be to build a professional army “from the people and for the people.” The government did not include members of the US-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces or the autonomous civil administration in northeast Syria. Al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi signed a breakthrough deal earlier this month in Damascus on a nationwide ceasefire and the merging of the US-backed force into the Syrian army. Among the new ministers whose names were announced late Saturday night were Hind Kabawat, a Christian activist who was opposed to Assad since the conflict began in March 2011. Kabawat was named minister of minister of social affairs and labor. Related article
      Trump admin has terminated majority of its funding for key Syrian humanitarian organization Another minister is Raed Saleh, who for years headed the Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets, and was named minister for emergency disasters. A Damascus-based Syrian Kurd, Mohammed Terko was named minister of education. Mohammed al-Bashir, who has headed Syria’s interim government since Assad’s fall, was named minister of energy whose main mission will be to restore the electricity and oil sectors that were badly damaged during the conflict. The new government’s main mission is to try to end the war and bring stability to the country that witnessed clashes and revenge killings earlier this month in the coastal region that is home to members of the minority Alawite sect. The violence left more than 1,000 people, mostly Alawites, dead. Assad is an Alawite. Most of Syria’s insurgent groups now running the country are Sunnis, but the presence of members of minority sects, including one woman and members of minority sects including an Alawite, is a message from al-Sharaa to Western countries that have been demanding that women and minorities be part of Syria’s political process. The announcement of a religiously mixed government aims to try to convince Western countries to lift crippling economic sanctions that were imposed on Assad more than a decade ago. The UN says that 90% of Syrians are below the poverty line, while millions face cuts in food aid as a result of the war. Hours before the government was announced, the US State Department cautioned U.S. citizens of the increased possibility of attacks during the Eid el-Fitr holiday, which it said could target embassies, international organizations and Syrian public institutions in Damascus. It added that methods of attack could include, but are not limited to, individual attackers, armed gunmen, or the use of explosive devices.",,0.22197853028774261
"It has become a familiar refrain: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that he is “changing the face of the Middle East.” It is, he says, “a war of rebirth.” It is, in a sense, undoubtedly true. Israel has troops in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. It’s vowed to demilitarize huge swaths of all three – backed by an unquestioning ally in the White House. The war in Gaza, which Israel restarted earlier this month, looks increasingly like it will lead to occupation for months or even years to come. But Netanyahu is a master tactician, not a master strategist, former Israeli national security officials tell CNN. He has seized opportunities to claw himself back from being in charge during the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust to unimaginable heights of power, at least in Israel. To cement his legacy, however, and for a grand strategy to materialize, the country and its national security leaders will need to overcome some fundamental and maybe intractable contradictions. “We didn’t start the war on October 7,” Ophir Falk, a top foreign policy adviser to Netanyahu, told CNN. “But we’re going to win it.” Gaza looms large The most difficult problem is also the most obvious: Gaza. Netanyahu wants “total victory” over Hamas, a goal a top military official derided as sloganeering, or “throwing sand in the eyes of the public.” The prime minister has never been willing to say what, when the war is over, Gaza should look like, only what it should not be – that is, governed by either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. “The big problem is with the government itself,” Israel Ziv, a retired Israeli general who once headed the military’s operations department, told CNN. “They are not fully committed to those goals (in Gaza). And now it’s not even clear – not to the army, and not to the public – what the government really wants.” Netanyahu’s indecision was rewarded when US President Donald Trump proposed that all Palestinians leave Gaza. It is, Netanyahu said, “the only plan that I think can work to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel, for the surrounding areas.” His extremist right-wing coalition partners could hardly believe their luck. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich celebrated: Hamas’ attacks on October 7, 2023 would culminate in Palestinians “losing their land forever,” he said. Though the cabinet has created an agency to facilitate those who want to “voluntarily” leave Gaza, it’s unclear whether the prime minister sees ethnic cleansing – that’s almost certainly what it would be – as a realistic or desirable goal. “It’s nonsense – don’t take it seriously,” Nitzan Nuriel, former director of the Counter-Terrorism Bureau in the Prime Minister’s Office, told CNN. It’s nothing more than a message to Israeli extremists and Trump, Nuriel said. But having decided to abandon the ceasefire framework that saw Hamas release 38 hostages earlier this year, Israel went back to maximum pressure: “From now on, negotiations will only take place under fire,” Netanyahu said. Israel’s defense minister has ordered the military to push forward in Gaza for a “permanent maintenance of the territory.” Seemingly every day, the military orders more Palestinians to once again leave their shelters and evacuate. Netanyahu told Israel’s parliament Wednesday that the operation “includes taking territory, and it includes other things that I will not detail here.” “If it doesn’t lead to renewed negotiations, then that would be very bad,” Eyal Hulata, former head of Israel’s National Security Council, told CNN. “What we will see is a permanent presence of the IDF fighting the counterinsurgency on the ground.” The most probable outcome, Nuriel said, is a prolonged occupation of Gaza and the appointment of an Israeli military governor to run its daily affairs – with the hope that “pragmatic” Gulf states will pick up the bill. “Is this a good idea? I don’t think so,” he said. “But politically, as far as I understand it, this is one of the government’s options. So we will see an offensive for four, five months. At the end of it, we will control all of that land. And at the end of it we will start to manage that piece of land, as we did at the end of the ‘67 war” – when Israel first seized control of Gaza from Egypt. The unknowns Gaza also brings with it issues that are rarely discussed in Israel, but which loom large nonetheless. Netanyahu remains under indictment for alleged war crimes at the International Criminal Court. The Israeli government itself stands accused of genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza. (Both vehemently deny the charges.) There is not a single person in Gaza whose life has not been touched by war. More than 95% have been forced from their homes. Israel has for weeks now blocked all humanitarian aid from entering the strip, and starvation looms. The government is seeking to destroy the UN agency that provides schooling, medical coverage and employment for millions of Palestinians – accusing UNRWA of failing to weed out extremists in its ranks. Though Gazans have begun to express more public anger at Hamas, their views towards Israel will have been almost unimaginably hardened over the course of the war. Then-US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this year that Hamas had recruited more militants than it had lost. Just as many Palestinians see Hamas’ October 7 attack – heinous as they may find it – as a direct result of  60 years of Israeli occupation, so too may these maximalist policies have unknowable and potentially devastating consequences for Israel. Saudi normalization Occupying Gaza also stands between Netanyahu and a key legacy project: normalizing diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. “The problem is that the key for this achievement is ending the war in Gaza,” Amos Yadlin, former head of Israeli military intelligence and former defense attaché in Washington, told CNN. “The Saudis will not come if Israel continues the war in Gaza.” Saudi officials have been explicit on the matter. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has called the war in Gaza a “genocide.” The country’s foreign minister told CNN last year that normalization was “off the table until we have a resolution to Palestinian statehood.” Israeli policymakers think the Saudis are posturing. “I don’t really think that that’s on top of their agenda,” an Israeli official told CNN. “And it’s not going to happen,” they said of a Palestinian state. “There’s no other issue on which there’s such consensus in Israel. It’s simply not going to happen.” A forceful regional response Israel’s response to the Hamas attack has also brought a more aggressive military posture in Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank – all under pressure from key government ministers who bring a radical, Jewish nationalist ideology previously unseen in the country’s halls of power. “What it seems like (Netanyahu) has in mind is to use the chaos in a way that would allow him to make the political gains, which he needs,” a former senior official told CNN. “This is not strategic. This is tactical politics. But this is what he is.” Israel now has a handful of military outposts in southern Lebanon, near the border. It has shown it is willing to regularly strike Hezbollah in a region of Lebanon from which, according to a 2006 UN Security Council resolution, they should be withdrawn. Israel’s year-long shooting war with Hezbollah – followed by a devastating bombing campaign and ground invasion – came in response to Hezbollah attacking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, on October 8, 2023. In Syria too, Israel seized upon the fall of the dictator Bashar al-Assad to launch nationwide strikes on military infrastructure, and to occupy the strategic Mount Hermon and a previously demilitarized buffer zone. While Netanyahu claims that Assad’s fall was a “direct result” of Israeli actions against his ally Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon, Nuriel said: “It was obviously not because of us.… We responded to something that happened. “If you ask me if there is any strategic plan by the prime minister, my answer is no.” And yet, those series of tactical decisions add up to a common theme in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, Nuriel said. Israeli security officials, he explained, are building similar lines of defense in all these places: “The borderline, fully secured by the IDF. Then a buffer zone, which nobody will be able to enter. And then another area without any ammunition.” The most uncertain zone of Israeli expansionism is in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. Israel already has at least 150 official settlements there, and the number of outposts that are illegal even under Israeli law has skyrocketed since October 7. The nationalist extremists in government would love for Israel to annex the West Bank, or at least the large swaths where Jews live, outside the major Palestinian cities – that is, to formally bring it under Israeli law and jurisdiction. Trump during his first term broke with the rest of the Western world in recognizing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which it seized from Syria in 1967. With his return to the White House, many see some form of Israeli annexation in the West Bank as almost inevitable. Trump’s pick for ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said he believes Israel has the “title deed” to the West Bank, which he refers to as Judea and Samaria, the biblical name used by some Israelis. (In his confirmation hearing, he told senators that he would defer to the president on annexation.) Iran That leaves the biggest unanswered question of them all: Iran. That nation is, for Netanyahu, the longest-standing bogeyman. Time and again, he casts the government in Tehran as the head of an octopus whose tentacles reach all the front lines on which Israel is fighting. Related article
      As Trump offers new nuclear talks, Iran weighs the cost of losing its final leverage “As Israel defends itself against Iran in this seven-front war, the lines separating the blessing and the curse could not be more clear,” he told the UN General Assembly last year. (There is no evidence to suggest Iran directed Hamas’ attack on October 7, let alone knew about it in advance.) In this he has much in common with Trump, for whom preventing Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon is a key goal. Where they diverge is how to get there. The Israeli national security sphere is awash with talk that Netanyahu is trying to get Trump on board with a preemptive strike to take out Iran’s nuclear facilities – as when Israel destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981. Again and again, he insists that “pressure, pressure, and more pressure” is the only acceptable response to Iran’s nuclear ambitions – hoping that a revolution will upend the regime there. Trump, on the other hand, has clearly expressed a desire for some sort of deal with Iran – despite his derision for the agreement reached by Barack Obama in 2015. “President Trump made it clear to Ayatollah Khamenei that he wanted to resolve the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program diplomatically – and very soon – and if this was not possible, there would be other ways to resolve the dispute,” a spokesman for the US National Security Council, Brian Hughes, told CNN earlier this month. An Israeli official denied that there was any disagreement between the two leaders. “I don’t see the daylight,” the Israeli official told CNN. “Both leaders have expressed explicitly that they will not tolerate a nuclear Iran, and the clock is ticking.” CNN’s Alayna Treene contributed to this report.",,0.2845459282398224
"A court in the United Arab Emirates has sentenced three people to death for the killing of Israeli-Moldovan Zvi Kogan, state media reported Monday. The state-run WAM news agency announced the verdicts of the three after a trial in Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeals’ State Security Chamber. It said a fourth person who aided the killing received a life sentence. It did not identify those charged. However, three Uzbek nationals had been arrested in Turkey and brought back to the UAE over the killing in November. Related article
      Three arrested over death in UAE of rabbi Israel says was murdered in ‘antisemitic act of terror’ “The defendants had tracked and murdered the victim,” the WAM report said. “The evidence presented by the State Security Prosecution to the court included the defendants’ detailed confessions to the crimes of murder and kidnapping, along with forensic reports, post-mortem examination findings, details of the instruments used in the crime and witness testimonies.” Authorities in the UAE have not offered a motive for the killing, nor any details about how Kogan was kidnapped and slain. However, it came amid the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which has inflamed anger across the wider Muslim world. Diplomatic ties between Israel and the UAE have remained intact, though strained, by the war as Israel maintains a consulate in Dubai and an embassy in Abu Dhabi. While not directly blaming Iran, Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others have referred to an “axis of evil” being responsible for Kogan’s killing — a phrase Israel in the past has used to refer to Iran and its allies. Iran’s Embassy in Abu Dhabi has denied Tehran was involved in the rabbi’s slaying and the UAE itself has not made the allegation. Kogan, 28, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi, ran a kosher grocery store in the futuristic city of Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords. The UAE has a burgeoning Jewish community, with synagogues and businesses catering to kosher diners. Kogan was an emissary of the Chabad Lubavitch movement, a prominent and highly observant branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism based in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood in New York City. He was buried in Israel. This story has been updated.",,0.3811807632446289
"Israel has launched a strike on Beirut for the second time in days, further testing the shaky ceasefire with Hezbollah struck four months ago. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said four people were killed, including a woman, and seven injured in the strike early Tuesday, which Israel said had targeted a Hezbollah militant. Two missiles hit the top three floors of a building in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon’s national news agency NNA reported.  Witnesses told Reuters that no evacuation warning was issued ahead of the strike and that families who lived there have now fled to other parts of the city. Israel’s military said in a statement the militant had allegedly “recently directed Hamas operatives and assisted them in planning a significant and imminent terror attack against Israeli civilians.” Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun condemned the attack. “Israel’s persistence in its aggression requires us to exert more effort to address Lebanon’s friends around the world and rally them in support of our right to full sovereignty over our land,” he said. Israel’s military said in a statement it had struck and killed Hezbollah “terrorist Hassan Ali Mahmoud Bdeir.” “Bdeir recently operated in cooperation with the Hamas terrorist organization, directed Hamas terrorists, and assisted them in planning and advancing a significant and imminent terror attack against Israeli civilians,” the statement said, adding that Hezbollah militants’ activities violate the “understandings between Israel and Lebanon.” The US State Department said Tuesday that Israel was defending itself from cross-border fire from Lebanon. “Hostilities have resumed because terrorists launched rockets into Israel from Lebanon,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement to CNN, adding that Washington supported Israel’s response. The attack comes just days after Israel launched its first strike on the Lebanese capital since a ceasefire with Hezbollah came into effect in November. Israel accused Hezbollah of launching two rocket attacks from southern Lebanon that crossed Israel’s border, a claim the Iran-backed group denied. Related article
      Israel strikes southern Beirut for the first time since November ceasefire “We will not allow firing on our communities, not even a drizzle… We will attack everywhere in Lebanon against any threat to the state of Israel, and we will ensure that all our residents in the north return to their homes safely,” said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday. The Lebanese army called Friday’s strike on the southern Dahieh neighborhood “a blatant and repeated violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and the security of its citizens, a challenge to international law, and a flagrant breach of the ceasefire agreement.” The US-brokered ceasefire agreement brought about a significant reduction in violence following more than a year of cross-border strikes and months of a full-scale war. However, Israel has continued to conducted dozens of strikes – mostly in southern Lebanon – on what it calls Hezbollah targets, and maintains a military presence at multiple locations in southern Lebanon, despite having agreed to withdraw as part of the deal.

"Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced Wednesday a major expansion of the military’s operation in Gaza involving the seizure of large areas of land that would be “incorporated into Israel’s security zones.” In the statement, Katz said the operation would also involve a “large-scale evacuation of Gaza’s population from combat zones,” without specifying details. Signs of the operation’s expansion are yet to be seen on the ground, although the enclave saw heavy airstrikes that have so far killed dozens people in the last 24 hours, according to local authorities, including at least nine children when a UN shelter was hit. According to the defense minister’s statement, the military operation would expand to “crush and clear the area of terrorists and terror infrastructure, while seizing large areas that will be incorporated into Israel’s security zone.” The Israeli military’s spokesperson for Arabic media late on Tuesday ordered residents in Gaza’s southern Rafah area to leave their homes and move north. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also announced a military escalation in Gaza in a video speech on Wednesday and vowed to increase pressure on the strip until all hostages held there are released. “We are also doing something else: We are seizing the Morag Corridor. This will be the second Philadelphi, an additional Philadelphi Corridor,” he added. The Morag Corridor refers to the settlement of Morag that once lay between Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza. The Philadelphi corridor is a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt. “Because we are now dividing the strip and increasing the pressure step by step, so that they will give us our hostages. And as long as they do not give them to us, the pressure will increase until they do,” Netanyahu said. There are 59 Israeli hostages held in Gaza, 24 believed to be alive, 35 believed to be dead.

      Bakeries close across Gaza as World Food Programme warns food supplies are set to run out in two weeks Last month, an Israeli official and a second source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel was making plans for a potential major ground offensive in Gaza that would involve sending tens of thousands of troops into combat to clear and occupy large swaths of the enclave. Katz’s statement on Wednesday did not specify whether additional Israeli troops would be involved in the expanded operation. The announcement comes as Israel continued its aerial bombardment on the strip. At least 17 people were killed in Israeli strikes overnight in southern Gaza, local hospitals said. Among those killed, at least 13 people - including women and children - had been sheltering in a residential house after being displaced from the Rafah area, according to Nasser Hospital. Two others were killed in a separate strike in central Gaza, according to Al Awda Hospital, which received their bodies. Also on Wednesday, Gaza’s Civil Defense said that 19 bodies, including those of nine children, were recovered following an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA clinic that acted as a shelter for displaced people in Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza. The IDF said it had “attacked terrorists from the Hamas terrorist organization” there, adding that “prior to the attack, many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians.” The IDF did not say whether the site it attacked was an UNRWA shelter but the UN said one of its facilities was hit. Katz’s announcement also comes after thousands of Palestinians last week protested against Hamas and Israel’s war in Gaza. Buoyed by the protests, the defense minister called on Gazans to take to the streets, saying Hamas is “endangering” the lives of Palestinians in the enclave. He said that the Israeli military would soon be operating “forcefully in additional areas in Gaza,” and urged Palestinians to remove Hamas from power and release all Israeli hostages. “This is the only way to stop the war,” he said. Israel resumed its offensive on Gaza two weeks ago, shattering a two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas, weeks after it imposed a complete blockade of humanitarian aid entering the enclave. It warned that its forces would maintain a permanent presence in parts of Gaza until the release of the remaining 24 hostages who are believed to still be alive. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in the enclave since then and the UN has warned that food supplies are running out. Local authorities and the United Nations have said that all bakeries in Gaza have closed due to a severe lack of fuel and flour. The closures are likely to accelerate the spread of famine in the strip, the head of the local Bakery Owners’ Association, Abdel Nasser Al-Ajrami told the Palestinian Press Agency Safa. Gaza’s fragile ceasefire was shattered on March 18 as Israel carried out deadly strikes across the enclave and Netanyahu vowed to use “increasing military strength” against Hamas. Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza on October 7, 2023, following the militant group’s surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s war with Hamas began, according to the territory’s health ministry. Hostage families are ‘horrified’ The Israeli military, led by its new and more aggressive chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, has been crafting plans for a large-scale operation in Gaza for weeks now. Such a decision could see the Israeli military occupying the territory and fighting insurgencies for years. But a longer-term offensive in Gaza could also draw stiff resistance from the Israeli public, a majority of which has been clamoring for a hostage release deal instead of a return to war. The families’ forum of the Israeli hostages on Wednesday said they were “horrified to wake up” to the news of the military operation being expanded. “Instead of securing the release of the hostages through an agreement and ending the war, the Israeli government is sending more soldiers into Gaza to fight in the same places they have fought time and again,” the forum said in a statement. Egypt and Qatar have intensified efforts to revive the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in recent days – with the militant group agreeing to a new Egyptian proposal on Sunday, and Israel responding with a counter-proposal on Monday. Egypt’s proposal would see Hamas release five hostages, including the American-Israeli Edan Alexander, in exchange for a renewed ceasefire, a Hamas source told CNN. It’s similar to the proposal presented several weeks ago by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, although it is not clear whether it also includes the release of additional bodies of deceased hostages.

"A 22-year-old Palestinian man was tortured and killed by Hamas militants after he criticized the group publicly and participated in rare anti-Hamas protests in Gaza, his family said. Uday Rabie was taken last week by dozens of armed fighters with Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, in the Tal al-Hawa neighborhood of Gaza City, his brother Hassan Rabie told CNN on Tuesday. Hassan said his brother had altercations with members of the group around a month before his death and had expressed fears that militants would come for him. Uday Rabie had also participated alongside thousands of others in anti-Hamas and anti-war protests that took place in the enclave earlier last week, his brother said. Rabie demonstrated in the al-Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City, Hassan said, chanting “No to Hamas” during the rally. Related video
      Largest anti-Hamas protests since start of war break out in northern Gaza Last Friday, a group of armed men affiliated with the Al-Qassam Brigades kidnapped and then tortured Rabie, Hassan said. The Palestinian man was taken off the street, days after he protested. “They took him, they kept torturing him,” Hassan told CNN. “They then called me and said: come get your brother.” “He was still alive” when the militants returned him, Hassan said. Rabie was only wearing underwear and the fighters had him “tied by the neck with a rope, and were dragging him, beating him,” Hassan added. “They handed him over to me, and told me, in these words: This is the fate of everyone who disrespects Al-Qassam Brigades and speaks ill of them,” Hassan said. Hassan said he collected his injured brother and took him to a nearby hospital. Footage shared on social media showed Rabie lying on a hospital bed, covered in large cuts and bruises that stretched along his arms, back and feet. Hassan confirmed the authenticity of the video, and said the man on the bed was indeed his brother. Rabie died shortly after being taken to the hospital, he said. A photo shared with CNN by the family shows Rabie after he died, his face heavily bruised, with parts of his hair and one eyebrow shaved. Hassan, 32, said that the family is “sure” Rabie was killed by members of the Al-Qassam Brigades, and “we have half of their names.” Related article
      ‘Enough war’: Why Gazans are protesting Hamas now CNN has reached out to Hamas’ Government Media Office for comment. The media office has, however, previously said that Palestinians’ right to express their opinions and participate in peaceful demonstrations is a “legitimate right, and an essential part of the national values we believe in and defend,” adding that the protests were reflective of the “tremendous pressure and daily massacres our people are subjected to.” The Al-Qassam Brigades has not yet publicly commented on the accusations. A written statement published by Rabie’s family on Facebook said that “a group claiming to be from Al-Qassam Brigades” kidnapped Rabie at 8:30 p.m. on Friday. After hours of searching for Rabie, the statement said, his family was told he was in the hands of the group, who said he needed to be “disciplined” for “cursing them.” According to the statement, Rabie was “tortured in the most severe manner with all kinds of sharp and hard objects.” He suffered “internal bleeding,” as well as several injuries to the head, pelvis and back, his family said. In the statement, Rabie’s family demanded retribution, and that Hamas bring those who killed him to justice. In a video that his brother said was shot about a week before his death, Rabie is seen speaking into the camera: “They (Hamas) want to take me, they want to kill me … I don’t know what they want from me.” Large demonstrations against Hamas have been held in northern Gaza in recent days as Palestinians call for end to a war in which more than 50,000 people have been killed during Israel’s military campaign following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. In a statement, the Independent Commission for Human Rights, a Palestinian rights organization established by former Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) head Yasser Arafat, condemned Rabie’s killing, saying it views “this crime as part of the deteriorating security chaos, the proliferation of weapons, and the absence of the rule of law in Gaza, posing a serious threat to public rights and freedoms.” CNN’s Eyad Kourdi, Irene Nasser and Mitchell McCluskey contributed reporting.",,0.2795700132846832
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that the country’s forces would be “switching gears” in Gaza, dividing and seizing more parts of the strip, moves experts say point to deeper, long-term Israeli control over the territory. Israel says it will escalate its campaign against Hamas in Gaza until it agrees to revised ceasefire terms, with the defense minister vowing to seize “large areas” of the enclave. On Friday, the Israel Defense Force said troops had moved into an area of northern Gaza, taking control of more territory days after the government announced plans to seize areas of the south. While there are no signs of a major boost in Israeli presence on the ground, Gaza has seen an intense bombing campaign, with the territory’s health ministry saying on Friday at least 86 people have been killed in the space of 24 hours, bringing the total number of the dead to 1,249 since Israel renewed its military operations in the strip on March 18.

      Israel announces expansion of military operation in Gaza to seize ‘large areas’ of land, ordering residents to leave Gaza’s Civil Defense said 25 people – all but one belonging to the same family – died in a strike on a house in Khan Younis early Friday. CNN has approached the Israeli military for comment. It remains unclear how much land Israel is prepared to seize or whether permanent annexation is being considered, however Netanyahu gave some hints, in particular saying his troops would wrest control over another key strip of land. “Last night in the Gaza Strip, we switched gears. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is seizing territory, striking the terrorists and destroying the infrastructure,” Netanyahu said in a video speech on Wednesday. “We are now dividing the strip and increasing the pressure step by step, so that they will give us our hostages. And as long as they do not give them to us, the pressure will increase until they do.” “We are also doing something else: We are seizing the Morag Corridor. This will be the second Philadelphi, an additional Philadelphi Corridor,” he added. The Morag Corridor refers to the settlement of Morag that once lay between the cities of Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza. The Philadelphi corridor is a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt, which Israel had also seized and continues to occupy as a major sticking point in ceasefire negotiations. A historic route linking Gaza’s Sufa crossing to the former settlement of Morag, the Morag Corridor could become a dividing line between Khan Younis and Rafah if seized by Israeli forces, experts told CNN on Wednesday. Gisha, an Israeli human rights organization that focuses on the freedom of movement of Palestinians, says that even before the current operation, Israel had already expanded its control of a buffer zone along the edges of the enclave, covering almost 52 square kilometers along the entire perimeter of the Strip, or 17% of its total area. Col.(res) Grisha Yakubovich, former Head of the Civil Department for the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) compared the move – which also follows a number of evacuation orders for Palestinians – to Israeli forces’ earlier creation of a “buffer zone” in northern Gaza, where troops cleared Hamas strongholds and established a security perimeter near Israeli border communities. In the south, he told CNN that the IDF may seek to evacuate Rafah’s population and extend a southern buffer zone. Holding these border zones puts pressure on Hamas while protecting Israeli communities, Yakubovich said. ‘Closed control’ Maj. Gen. (res.) Eitan Dangot, former Coordinator of Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT), speculated that seizing the Morag corridor could be the start of dividing Gaza into three broad sections for greater control. “It means Israel or the IDF is going through a very clear process in order to keep areas under closed control by military forces that prevent movement from area to area,” he said. “There will be full control of traffic that will be allowed to enter and to cross. That means if the time comes that Israel will allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, the control of the convoys will be under more close control,” Dangot added. Focusing on the Morag corridor is also “a kind of a political decision in order to give the right-wing extremists in the government, a kind of hope that maybe we will be back in some areas (settlements) as before,” Dangot added. “When you say ‘Morag’ out loud, it means going back to the disengagement of Gush Katif.” Gush Katif was a bloc of several Israeli settlements, including the agricultural settlement of Morag, in the southern Gaza Strip. When Israel disengaged from the Gaza Strip in 2005, then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dismantled Gush Katif and expelled some 8,000 Jewish residents living there. Some Israeli settlers have since October 7 called for a return to Gush Katif and for the re-settlement of Gaza, a movement emboldened by Israel’s right-wing politicians who have openly called for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza. Gaza’s fragile ceasefire was shattered on March 18 as Israel carried out deadly strikes across the enclave and Netanyahu vowed to use “increasing military strength” against Hamas until all hostages are released. Hostage talks have stalled, with Hamas rejecting Israel’s latest proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza which would have seen a 40-day truce in exchange for the release of 11 hostages, itself a counterproposal to an Egyptian offer Hamas agreed. A total of 24 living hostages are believed to be in Gaza and the bodies of 35 deceased hostages are thought to still be held in the enclave. After the first phase of the deal ended in early March, Israel said it would block all aid going into Gaza until Hamas accepted a new, US-backed extension of the ceasefire. Hamas – which wants to see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza - rejected the plan, accusing Israel of reneging over commitments made during initial talks over the truce. Israel resumed full-scale military operations soon after – and mediators are struggling to revive negotiations. Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza on October 7, 2023, following the militant group’s surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The war has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza since October 7, 2023, according to the territory’s health ministry. Authorities in Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters when reporting casualty figures, but the health ministry and the United Nations say the majority of deaths are women and children Among the living, desperation is growing as hunger reaches critical levels under Israel’s weeks-long humanitarian blockade of the enclave. On Wednesday, a large crowd forcibly broke into a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) warehouse in Gaza’s Al-Tuffah neighborhood, looting bags of flour meant for humanitarian distribution. “Hunger and desperation are spreading as food and relief assistance are being weaponized,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on X on Thursday.

"For weeks, US airstrikes have pounded Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting oil refineries, airports and missile sites, with President Trump vowing to use “overwhelming force” until the US achieves its goal of stopping the Houthis from targeting shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis began the campaign in solidarity with Palestinians when Israel went to war in Gaza in October 2023. The group has carried out more than 100 attacks and have sunk two vessels. The result: 70% of merchant shipping that once transited the Red Sea now takes the long route around southern Africa. The US says the campaign is working. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said that multiple Houthi leaders had been killed. But every round of strikes provokes more defiance. The Houthis are what one veteran Yemen-watcher calls the honey badgers of resistance, referring to the belligerent mammal known for its fearless attitude toward predators. Bitten by a cobra, they get up minutes later and attack the snake. Related article
      Cost of US military offensive against Houthis nears $1 billion with limited impact While as many as 80 Houthi military officers may have been killed, according to analysts, the senior echelon of its military and political leadership appears intact. So are at least some of its missile-launching sites. Since mid-March, the Houthis have launched a dozen ballistic missiles at Israel, and barrages of drones and missiles at US navy ships. While none caused major damage, the threat remains. CNN reported on Friday that the total cost of the US military’s operation against the Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen is nearing $1 billion in just under three weeks, according to three people briefed on the campaign, but the attacks had so far had limited impact on destroying the group’s capabilities. “We are burning through readiness — munitions, fuel, deployment time,” said one official. Far from being cowed, the Houthis have threatened to extend their range of targets to the UAE, which backs the rival government to the Houthis in Yemen’s Civil War. Similarly, Saudi officials say the Kingdom’s air defenses are on high alert. “The dozens of airstrikes on Yemen will not deter the Yemeni Armed Forces from fulfilling their religious, moral, and humanitarian duties,” said a Houthi spokesman earlier this week. There’s no doubt that the US campaign has degraded the Houthis’ capabilities. Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, says he suspects the Houthis “have lost a lot of drone manufacturing capability, and there does seem to be more effective interdiction of resupply shipments coming via the sea and via Oman. So the Houthis are not comfortable.” Related article
      US moves B-2 stealth bombers to Indian Ocean island in massive show of force to Houthis, Iran But history shows that the Houthis have an extraordinarily high tolerance for pain. And the Trump administration’s determination to eradicate the threat they pose may ultimately require a ground offensive. “The Houthis are just inured to being at war with a first world military,” Knights says.“They’re ideological, but they’re also very tough tribal fighters from northern Yemen.” The Houthis’ ability to survive is helped by an elaborate smuggling network that brings in missile parts and other equipment.  Last year, hidden among cargo on one intercepted ship, air frames and fins for artillery rockets, small turbojet engines and hydrogen fuel cells were discovered, according to an investigation by Conflict Armament Research (CAR). Such equipment could enable Houthi UAVs to carry larger payloads and to travel for far longer periods. That would “greatly extend the potential threat posed by the Houthis,” CAR reported. The Houthis survived several offensives during the long presidency of Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen, then a Saudi offensive ten years ago, followed by more recent Israeli, UK and US airstrikes. Ahmed Nagi, a senior analyst on Yemen at the International Crisis Group, says Israel and western powers lack a deep understanding of the Houthis. “Their opaque leadership and internal structure have created persistent gaps in intelligence.” Another Yemen expert, Elisabeth Kendall, questions the endgame of the US campaign. “The Houthis have been bombed tens of thousands of times over the past decade and remain undeterred. So one is left thinking that the bombing is largely performative: let’s show the world - we’ll do it because we can.” Related article
      Dozens reported killed after Trump orders ‘decisive’ strikes against Yemen’s Houthis Coercing the Houthis, Knights told CNN, is “really, really difficult.” “They are an extremely aggressive movement. The best way to end them permanently is to overthrow them, remove them from the capital, remove them from the Red Sea coast.” Regional diplomatic sources, as well as analysts, say that ultimately only a ground offensive can dislodge the Houthis, who currently control the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, its major port, Hodeidah, and much of northern Yemen. Ahmed Nagi, a senior analyst on Yemen at the International Crisis Group, says the US is wrong to believe that airstrikes can compel the Houthis to back down. “This approach failed under the Biden administration and is unlikely to succeed under the Trump administration.” “Their logic is shaped by years of war; they see resilience as a form of strength and are driven to prove they are not easily deterred.” “The only times I’ve ever seen the Houthis go to the negotiating table or compromise has been when they’ve been threatened with the realistic prospect of defeat on the ground: territorial loss, loss of control of populations and loss of access to the Red Sea coastline,” said Knights. That briefly happened in 2017 when forces backed by the United Arab Emirates threatened Houthi access to the Red Sea, critical for the Houthis’ revenue and military supplies. The Houthis, if anything, may actually be relishing US strikes. They are a “direct answer to the Houthi prayers to have a war with the US,” said Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni research fellow at Chatham House. The group “wants to drag the US into a larger regional escalation.” A ground offensive The Houthis are fighting for control of Yemen against the internationally recognized government that controls part of the south and is supported mainly by the UAE. The unanswered question is whether forces loyal to that government can take the fight to the Houthis. “They’re already trained and equipped,” says Knights. But there are doubts about their unity. Analysts do not expect the US to put any troops on the ground, beyond a handful of special forces to help direct airstrikes. The US would perhaps provide [Yemeni forces] “with a bit of logistics, certain key munitions,” Knights says. The UAE would be “quietly supportive” as it has long supplied the Aden-based government, he adds. The Saudi perspective is less clear. Knights believes Riyadh is apprehensive about the Houthis retaliating with long-range drones and missiles against its infrastructure. But the US has accelerated deliveries of anti-missile defenses to Saudi Arabia in recent months. The US will have to say to Riyadh: “We are going to protect you in the same way that we protected Israel in 2024 from the two rounds of Iranian strikes,” says Knights. Regional diplomatic sources say preparations are underway for a ground operation that would be launched from the south and east, as well as along the coast. A coordinated offensive could also involve Saudi and US naval support in an attempt to retake the port of Hodeidah. “Whether such an operation is feasible remains unclear, as the past decade has shown mixed outcomes, successes in some areas and failures in others,” Nagi told CNN. The Iran link From day one, President Trump and other US officials have linked the campaign against the Houthis to Iran. Trump said he would hold Iran responsible for “every shot” fired by Houthi rebels and it would face “dire” consequences for any attacks by the Yemeni militants. So far it hasn’t, and it’s unclear whether Tehran can simply order the Houthis to stop firing. While very much part of Iran’s axis of resistance, the Houthis retain considerable autonomy. Trump continues to warn Iran that it will face a massive bombing campaign if it doesn’t do a deal to limit its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. For the administration, the Houthi campaign and the “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran are two sides of the same coin. The Iranians are treading carefully, offering moral support to their ally in Yemen. Former Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Mohsen Rezaee hailed “the barefooted resistance forces of Yemen, who will bring advanced American warships to their knees.” But the Iranian leadership does not want to be seen providing further military support for the Houthis right now as it tries to work out Trump’s mixture of small carrot and large stick. The US appears ready to expand its campaign. B-2 bombers and KC-135 refuelling planes have arrived on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. That may presage strikes on hardened targets in Yemen but may equally be a signal to Iran. The next few weeks may be a crucial test of the honey badgers’ resilience.",,0.2800231873989105
"A video has emerged showing the final moments of more than a dozen Palestinian emergency workers shot dead by Israeli troops in Gaza last month, casting doubt on Israeli claims that soldiers opened fire on vehicles “advancing suspiciously.” The video is filmed from the front of a vehicle and shows a convoy of clearly marked ambulances moving along a road at dawn, with headlights and flashing emergency lights on. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says the video was found on the phone of one of the 15 ambulance and relief team members killed by the Israeli military. Their bodies were found in a mass grave more than a week after they were reported as missing. Eight of the 14 bodies recovered from the site in the southern Rafah area were identified as members of the PRCS, five as civil defense, and one as a UN agency employee, PRCS said in a statement. The deaths sparked international condemnation, and the footage appears to contradict the assertion by the Israeli military that some vehicles were moving suspiciously without lights. Related article
      Bodies of missing aid workers found in Gaza ‘mass grave’ following Israeli attacks The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) asserted last week that “several uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals. IDF troops then opened fire at the suspected vehicles.” After the video emerged, the IDF repeated that the incident was being investigated – the first results of which were presented internally on Sunday. “All claims, including the documentation circulating about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation,” it said Saturday. The video shows the convoy stopping when it comes across another vehicle at the side of the road –  which the PRCS says was an ambulance that had been sent earlier to help injured civilians. Two of the rescuers who get out of the vehicles are wearing uniforms. A fire truck and an ambulance at the scene are marked with the PRCS insignia. Almost immediately there is intense gunfire, which can be heard hitting the convoy. The video ends, but the audio continues for five minutes. The paramedic filming, identified by the PRCS as Rifaat Radwan, is heard repeatedly saying the “shahada,” which Muslims recite when facing death. He asks God for forgiveness and says he knows he is going to die. At one point he says: “Forgive me mom, this is the path I chose – to help people – I swear I didn’t choose this path but to help people.” The voices of others in the convoy can also be heard, as well as those of people shouting commands in Hebrew. It’s not clear who they are or what they are saying. Initial investigation findings The IDF said the findings of the investigation were presented to Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir on Sunday. The investigation includes information from Israeli aerial surveillance video that has not been made public, an Israeli military official told CNN previously. Asor began re-investigating the incident after footage emerged contradicting IDF soldiers’ description of the vehicles as moving with their lights off, the Israeli military official said. That information came directly from IDF soldiers involved in the attack, who initially testified that the ambulances had their lights off, the official said. According to the military official, troops from the Golani infantry brigade had set up an ambush along a road in the early hours of March 23. Around 4:30 a.m., they opened fire on a first vehicle, killing two individuals and detaining another who the IDF claims were Hamas internal security officials. Roughly two hours later, at approximately 6 a.m., the ambulance convoy arrived in the area. Soldiers were told by drone operators that the vehicles were advancing “in a suspicious manner,” the military official said, adding that soldiers involved in the attack claimed to investigators that they opened fire after being surprised by the convoy stopping on the side of the road and by individuals getting out of their vehicles quickly. After seeing the bodies of more than a dozen uniformed emergency responders on the ground, the troops said they still believed they had successfully carried out the attack following efforts to verify the identities of some of the deceased, the military official said. The Israeli military has yet to provide any evidence for its claim that nine of the emergency workers killed were militants. The IDF said on April 1 that “following an initial assessment, it was determined that the forces had eliminated a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, who took part in the October 7 massacre, along with eight other terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.” The IDF did not offer proof of the identity of the alleged terrorists. CNN has obtained from the PRCS the names of 14 of those killed; none is identified as Mohammad Shubaki. The PRCS said the name of the fifteenth man killed – an UNRWA employee – was withheld out of respect for his family but was not the name given by the Israeli military. An Israeli military official told CNN last week that Israeli forces buried the bodies of the workers because they expected it would take time to coordinate their retrieval with the PRCS and the United Nations. Israeli officials have not explained why their emergency vehicles were also buried, citing the ongoing investigation. Satellite imagery from March 23, first published by Al Jazeera Arabic and analyzed by CNN, shows Israeli army vehicles surrounding a cluster of five ambulances from the PRCS and Civil Defense. Another satellite image, also published by Al Jazeera and analyzed by CNN, dated March 25, shows an Israeli tank, an excavator, and other military vehicles at the same location. Where the ambulances once stood, remnants of vehicles protruded from disturbed ground. This story has been updated to reflect comment from an IDF official.",,0.19842374324798584
"Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian-American teenager and wounded two others in the occupied West Bank on Sunday night, according to Palestinian officials, after the Israeli military said it targeted a group throwing stones at cars. Ramallah governor Laila Ghannam said the 14-year-old Palestinian-American boy was shot dead by Israeli troops in the village of Turmusaya. Two other Palestinian-American boys, ages 14 and 15, were injured in the incident, according to the mayor of Turmusaya, Lafi Shalabi. The Israeli military said its soldiers opened fire during a counterterrorism operation in Turmusaya when they saw three “terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving.” The soldiers killed one and hit the other two, the military said. The military shared a blurry video purportedly showing the incident, in which three figures are seen. At the end of the short clip, one of the figures appears to hurl an object. The Israeli military said it would continue operating in the West Bank “to protect the residents in the area.” The injured boys were shot in the abdomen, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. One severely injured boy and another with minor wounds were taken to a hospital in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said. The killing of a Palestinian-American teenager came just hours before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in the United States to meet President Donald Trump. On Monday a US State Department spokesperson confirmed the death of a US citizen in the West Bank, offered condolences to the family and noted the death “occurred during a counter-terrorism operation” and that the Israeli military was investigating. “Out of respect for the privacy of the family during this difficult time, we have no further comment at this time,” the spokesperson said. And on Tuesday US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the US needs “to learn more about the nature of what happened on the ground.” The teenager grew up in New Jersey, according to Governor Phil Murphy, who expressed his condolences for the boy’s family. The killing or detention of American citizens in occupied Palestinian territories by Israelis and concerns about a lack of accountability date back years. In 2003, American activist Rachel Corrie, 23, was crushed by an Israeli army bulldozer while trying to block it from razing Palestinian homes in Gaza. Nine years later, an Israeli civil court ruled her death an accident. In spring 2022, prominent Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed while reporting in the West Bank. That November, Defense Minister Benny Gantz confirmed that Israel would not cooperate with a US probe into her death. A CNN investigation suggested that Abu Akleh was shot dead in a targeted attack by Israeli forces, despite wearing a vest marked “Press.” In February last year, Florida-born US citizen Mohammed Khdour, 17, was killed by Israeli forces who shot him in the head while he was in his car. The teenager was taking the car out during a study break, snacking on chocolate waffles, posing for Instagram. Related article
      Israeli outposts have proliferated in the West Bank since Oct. 7, analysis shows. Palestinians fear annexation could be next. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) referred questions about Khdour’s case to the Israeli Security Agency, known as the Shin Bet, which did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Three weeks before Khdour’s death, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, a 17-year-old Palestinian-American who grew up in Louisiana, was also shot in the head by apparent Israeli gunmen. The IDF told CNN they received a report that an off-duty police officer and an Israeli civilian shot at a Palestinian “suspected of throwing stones” – which his family vehemently denied – and that the Israeli Police were investigating the shooting. Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank have intensified since late January following the launch of an expanded military campaign there almost immediately after the Gaza ceasefire began. Since then, roughly 40,000 Palestinians have been displaced from their homes. The Israeli military says it is targeting Palestinian militant groups who have mounted attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, but Palestinians and human rights groups say the expanded assault is increasingly indiscriminate – killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in a manner consistent with collective punishment. In late February, Israel deployed tanks to the occupied West Bank for the first time in two decades.

"President Donald Trump was speaking to reporters alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office on Monday when he made a surprise announcement: Direct nuclear talks are underway between the United States and Iran and a “very big meeting” will take place on Saturday. Related article
      Netanyahu met Trump seeking wins on tariffs and Iran. He returns to Israel empty-handed If true, these would be the first direct talks between the two nations since 2015, when they signed a landmark nuclear deal under the Obama administration, which Trump ditched three years later. Iran denies that negotiations are direct, insisting they will be mediated by the Gulf Arab nation of Oman, where Saturday’s talks will take place. Direct or not, the talks represent a breakthrough between the Islamic Republic and a US administration led by a president whom American officials accuse Tehran of once plotting to assassinate. Trump has pledged to deliver a far “stronger” nuclear deal than Obama’s. His administration has said it will push for the complete dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program, rather than merely restricting it to peaceful purposes. Israel backs this demand – but Tehran has dismissed it outright as a non-starter. Here’s what we know about the talks, why they may be happening now and what’s at stake. What each side is saying Trump on Monday said a “very big meeting” would take place Saturday “at the top level,” adding that “everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,” referring to potential military action against Iranian nuclear sites. US envoy Steve Witkoff will be leading the US delegation, according to the US State Department, and Araghchi will represent Iran in indirect talks moderated by Oman officials, according to Iranian officials. On Wednesday, Araghchi said in a Washington Post op-ed that his country is ready to strike a peaceful deal with the US through diplomacy, which could result in a “trillion-dollar” business opportunity, and avoid a costly US military involvement in the region. He wrote that the “ball is in America’s court” to achieve peace and normalize relations, which could include lucrative business opportunities, in an apparent attempt to speak to Trump’s business background. Araghchi also made clear the talks would be indirect, writing that “indirect negotiations is not a tactic or reflection of ideology but a strategic choice rooted in experience,” especially when faced with “a significant wall of mistrust.” Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat and ex-nuclear negotiator, said that Iran and the US are likely to “initially start the negotiations indirectly, and after an hour or two, if the outcome is positive, Iranian and American representatives will begin direct talks.” “It seems that Washington and Tehran have adopted a wise approach, and there is a chance for an agreement,” he wrote on X. How the two sides got here A nuclear deal was reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers, including the US. Under the deal, Iran had agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. That agreement was, however, abandoned by Trump in 2018 during his first presidential term. Iran retaliated by resuming its nuclear activities, and has so far advanced its program to alarming levels. In December, Rafael Grossi, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, told Reuters that Iran was “dramatically” accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade. In January, Grossi again warned that Iran was “pressing the gas pedal” on its uranium enrichment. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful. Last month, Trump sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proposing negotiations on a new nuclear deal, making it clear that Iran had a two-month deadline to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the letter’s contents told CNN. Days later, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said the Islamic Republic rejected direct negotiations with the US. He said however that Iran’s response, delivered by Oman, left open the possibility of indirect talks with Washington. Related article
      Trump gives Iran two-month deadline to reach new nuclear deal “We don’t avoid talks; it’s the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” Pezeshkian said in televised remarks. “They must prove that they can build trust.” Iran has in recent weeks been vocal with its concerns about striking a nuclear deal with Trump, who it says has a history of backtracking. Pezeshkian was elected last year on a reformist agenda that pledged to mend the country’s relationship with the world and ease sanctions that have crippled the economy. But he also faces a powerful hardline establishment, including Khamenei, that distrusts the US and is wary of engaging with it. The value of Iran’s currency, the rial, increased off the back of the news of talks after recording a record low just weeks ago. What’s on the agenda of talks? US officials have said that Trump is demanding that Iran dismantle its entire nuclear program, and not just accept restrictions on its ability to build a nuclear weapon, as it did in 2015. The 2015 deal allowed Iran to “fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),” according to the treaty. The NPT, to which Iran is signatory, is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Related article
      As Trump offers new nuclear talks, Iran weighs the cost of losing its final leverage Experts have said that complete denuclearization would be a non-starter for Iran given that the nuclear program is its last remaining point of leverage against the West after its regional proxies have been weakened. Last week, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Trump will demand a “full dismantlement” of Iran’s uranium enrichment program. “Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see,” Waltz said, adding that Tehran must agree to “walk away completely” from its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Waltz added that this time, the deal won’t be “some kind of tit for tat that we had under the Obama administration, or Biden.” Asked whether the deal would be similar to the 2015 agreement, Trump on Monday told reporters that “it’ll be different, and maybe a lot stronger.” If talks are not successful, he added, “I think Iran’s going to be in great danger… I actually think it’ll be a very bad day for Iran.” How does Israel feel about it? The sudden revelation of the upcoming US-Iran talks at the press conference following Trump and Netanyahu’s meeting appeared to surprise the Israeli prime minister, the smile quickly vanishing from his face as he looked toward his team of advisers. News of the talks are “certainly not” to Israel’s liking, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. It’s unclear if Netanyahu was given advance notice of the US-Iran talks or if he was consulted ahead of time, the sources said. Sat beside Trump at the Oval Office, Netanyahu touted a Libya-style nuclear deal between the US and Iran, which in 2003 dismantled the North African nation’s nuclear program in the hopes of ushering in a new era of relations with the US after its two-decade oil embargo on Muammar Qaddafi’s regime. “If it can be done diplomatically, in a full way, the way it was done in Libya, I think that would be a good thing,” Netanyahu said. Following denuclearization, Libya eventually descended into civil war after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed Qaddafi. Iranian officials have long warned that a similar deal would be intended to weaken Iran and eventually overthrow its regime. Asked about a Libya-style deal, Araghchi told Iranian media on Tuesday that Israel’s hopes for what Iran’s nuclear program should look like would be disregarded. “When it comes to the Zionist regime’s hopes of what a deal will look like and what they have suggested, that’s their hopes and ultimately will not be factored in,” he said. Netanyahu had vehemently opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, saying it did not prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon. Why now? Since the last US-Iran talks, Tehran has seen its ability to project power in the region significantly curtailed after Israel struck severe blows to its allied regional militias and launched direct attacks on Iranian soil. In Gaza, Israel continues to pound the enclave as it seeks to eradicate Hamas. In Syria, which Iran used as transit for weapons to proxies, Tehran’s ally Bashar al-Assad has been deposed, and Israel continues to attack the country and take new territory. In Iraq, the US has retaliated against attacks by Iran-backed militants on its assets there. And in Lebanon, a series of Israeli attacks on the country have decapitated the militant group Hezbollah. In Yemen, where Iran’s last remaining ally, the Houthi rebel group, remains standing, the US is intensifying airstrikes. Last year, Iran and Israel exchanged two rounds of tit-for-tat attacks, the first time either side has directly attacked the other. Israel is said to have taken out Iranian defenses in one of those attacks. “Remember, the Iranians’ air defenses have been eviscerated by that attack from Israel. They’re open to attack today,” Witkoff told journalist Tucker Carlson in an interview last month.

"One month after Israel cut off humanitarian aid from the Gaza Strip, aid agencies say the humanitarian situation there has deteriorated dangerously, with the plight of two million civilians worsened by intensive Israeli military operations. The United Nations and several NGOs, as well as civilians in Gaza who have spoken with CNN, say hunger is spreading, there is less access to clean water, and fleas infest makeshift displacement camps. The problems that have plagued the territory’s population for the last 18 months have been accentuated by the renewed assault launched by the Israeli military in March, which has included several evacuation orders. The Israeli government shut down the supply of food and other humanitarian aid into Gaza ahead of the offensive, in a bid to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and impose new conditions on the extension of the ceasefire. Israel has also said Hamas intercepts and diverts shipments of humanitarian aid into Gaza, a charge the US confirmed last May. The Israeli military’s renewed assault in Gaza has displaced almost 400,000 Palestinians, according to the UN. At least 1,391 Palestinians, including 505 children, have been killed since March 18, Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported on Monday. It was the highest one-week death toll among children in Gaza in the past year, according to the UN. Assem Al-Nabeeh, a spokesperson for the Gaza City municipality, told CNN that after several recent evacuation orders “people are literally being displaced everywhere, on main roads, in public parks, near garbage dumps, in squares, and even in buildings that are on the verge of collapse.” “Even before the latest evacuation orders, only 40% of the city had access to water,” Al-Nabeeh said. He estimated that 175,000 tonnes of waste had accumulated across the city. The senior OCHA official for Palestinian territories, Jonathan Whittall, said earlier this week that a “war without limits” was underway in Gaza. In a report released Friday, OCHA said: “Gaza faces renewed risk of hunger and malnutrition as the full cargo blockade, now entering the second month, almost halts all flour distribution and shuts all subsidized bakeries.” The World Food Programme (WFP) said on Thursday that all 25 subsidized bakeries across Gaza had closed because of a lack of cooking gas and flour. It added that more than one million people were left without food parcels in March, and while the supply of hot meals was continuing, current “supplies will last two weeks maximum.” Related article
      Israeli soldiers reveal systematic destruction of Palestinian property to create Gaza buffer zone The Israeli agency in charge of coordinating aid deliveries into Gaza says there must be “ a structured monitoring and aid entry mechanism” to prevent Hamas from seizing humanitarian supplies and to assure organizations’ operations stay “neutral and impartial.” The agency – COGAT – said a new mechanism it is preparing would “support aid organizations, enhance oversight and accountability, and ensure that assistance reaches the civilian population in need, rather than being diverted and stolen by Hamas.” The mechanism has been presented to international aid organizations, according to an official in COGAT, but its use is contingent upon a ceasefire deal or a change in government directive. In the meantime, huge amounts of aid sit outside Gaza. WFP says that some 89,000 tonnes of food waits outside Gaza, while food scarcity inside is driving up prices dramatically. A bag of wheat flour costs 450% more than it did a few weeks ago. Meanwhile, OCHA says access to water remains “severely constrained” – with two-thirds of Gazan households unable to access six liters (around 200 fluid ounces) of drinking water per day. After an improvement in water production and supply during the recent ceasefire, agencies are now struggling to repair and maintain infrastructure. That’s also affecting sanitation in areas increasingly crowded with displaced people. “Sanitation conditions across the Gaza Strip remain alarming,” OCHA said, with makeshift displacement sites on the coast infested with fleas and mites. ‘Massacre of Palestinians’ The Biden administration repeatedly pressured the Israeli government to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, including pausing a shipment of bombs over concern about the civilian population in the coastal enclave. But that pressure has all but vanished under the Trump administration. Gavin Kelleher of the Norwegian Refugee Council said at the end of March that “more than a million people remain in dire need of tents in Gaza” but his organization  had “almost nothing left to distribute despite still seeing these massive forced transfers happening every day.” “Many people, with no alternative shelter, are staying in structurally unsound and damaged buildings, where incidents of buildings collapsing on top of men, women and children continue to be recorded,” Kelleher added. In recent weeks, an average of 100 children have been killed or maimed daily in Gaza, according to the UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF.  The agency’s executive director, Catherine Russell, said the strip’s children had “again been plunged into a cycle of deadly violence and deprivation.” UNICEF says it and other agencies “have been unable to provide clothing and other essential items even to the most vulnerable of displaced children who only have the clothes they are wearing.” On Monday, a group of independent UN experts warned that Israel’s actions in Gaza were “leading to a massacre of Palestinians.” “We are witnessing the destruction of Palestinian life,” the experts said in a statement. “If they are not killed by bombs or bullets, they slowly suffocate for lack of basic means of survival. The only difference is the means and speed of death.” As casualties have risen since the ceasefire ended, the World Health Organization also reported that Gaza’s hospitals are overwhelmed with patients. It said Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the territory was dealing with 400 people daily, nearly triple its average of 140 before hostilities resumed on 18 March. Dr. Fadel Naeem, director of the Al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, told CNN his facility was overwhelmed by the number of bodies and injured people arriving. On April 3 alone, he said, 128 injured individuals had arrived “and the hospital simply lacks the capacity to handle this volume due to the ongoing blockade on the health sector.” Naeem said the hospital had been forced to “prioritize,” by, for example, performing surgeries only for those who were more likely to survive. “Tragically, while waiting for care, some of the wounded died due to a lack of resources, operating rooms, and medical staff,” Naeem added. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Relief and Works Agency, which leads UN efforts in Palestinian territories, said “People are starving, chaos & looting have returned… People are exhausted as they continue to be locked up in a tiny piece of land.” CNN’s Sana Noor Haq contributed reporting.",,0.22834821045398712
"Israel has released a Palestinian man who was controversially arrested at the age of 13, after he spent nearly a decade in jail. Ahmad Manasra has been reunited with his family, his lawyer Khaled Zabarqa told CNN. “Ahmad has completed his 10-year sentence and he is a free person now,” Zabarqa said. “The Israeli authorities have imposed restriction on the family as far as holding a welcome ceremony for Ahmad or talking to the media. “ Ahmad Manasra was arrested and imprisoned in 2015 after being caught with his cousin Hassan who stabbed two Israelis in East Jerusalem. Hassan was shot dead at the scene while Manasra was run over by a car. Manasra’s case gained international attention after a video emerged of crowds shouting abuse at him after the incident while he lies motionless, seriously injured and crying out. Other footage allegedly shows Israeli officials interrogating Manasra under duress as he is visibly shaken and vulnerable, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society. Related article

His sentence was revised down to nine and a half years following an appeal in 2017 International groups have repeatedly called on Israeli authorities for his release over the years over concerns of his treatment and extended stays in solitary confinement, coupled with mental health issues and a schizophrenia diagnosis. “His physical and medical condition is very difficult as he suffers from head injuries and physiological mental health as he was in solitary confinement and was subjected to harsh interrogation when he was a child,” his lawyer said. Israel’s prison authorities confirmed Manasra was being released on Thursday, adding “Israel is a state of law, we don’t torture people here.”",,0.2890785038471222
"The Israeli military is extending its ground operations deep into Gaza, creating a large buffer zone between the Strip and Israeli territory and pushing hundreds of thousands of civilians into an ever-smaller area on the Mediterranean coast. By CNN’s tally, the Israel Defense Forces has issued 20 evacuation orders since March 18, encompassing large parts of Gaza, including all of Rafah in the south. In all, according to the United Nations, some 400,000 people have been told to move over the past three weeks, as the Israeli military intensifies efforts to force Hamas to free Israeli hostages. In the process much of Gaza has become uninhabitable or out of bounds. The streets of Gaza City were crammed with waves of fleeing civilians Friday, carrying what they could as they left other parts of central and northern Gaza. One displaced man, Raed Radwan, watched as hundreds more people entered the neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan, describing it as “completely filled with tents and displaced families.” “I see tents and people lining both sides of the road in heartbreaking conditions.Bulldozers are clearing the rubble of bombed homes to make space for more tents,” he told CNN. Hatem Abdulsalam, also in Gaza City, told CNN that he could not “describe what we’re suffering due to garbage, flies, mosquitoes and strange insects, they are everywhere due to the waste piling up in the streets.” “You see tents for the displaced everywhere, even among piles of garbage, because of the lack of space.” The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Friday that more than two-thirds of Gaza is now either under active displacement orders or designated as “no-go” zones – areas where humanitarian teams are required to coordinate their movements with Israeli authorities. The Israeli strategy, set out by Defense Minister Israel Katz, is to empty large parts of Gaza and treat anyone staying behind as a combatant. Israeli officials have spoken of ratcheting up the pressure on Hamas to force it to make concessions on the release of the remaining hostages. “Many areas are being captured and added to the security zones of the State of Israel, making Gaza smaller and more isolated,” Katz said on a visit to Gaza last week. Katz spoke of “cutting Gaza into parts, even in places like the Morag route, where we have not operated until now.” The Morag Corridor refers to the dismantled Jewish settlement of Morag in southern Gaza that once existed between Khan Younis and Rafah. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday that with the occupation of the corridor, “the encirclement of Rafah has been completed.” A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel is planning to hold a significant portion of Gaza for an “indefinite” period of time. Still, after 18 months of war, Israel is still facing a dogged adversary. In August last year, Israel declared that Hamas’ Rafah Brigade had been defeated as it established control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border. But earlier this week, the new IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, told Israeli troops in Gaza, “I expect you to defeat Hamas’ Rafah Brigade and to achieve victory wherever you operate.” And on Saturday, three rockets were fired from southern Gaza towards Israel, despite the IDF’s control over much of the area. Related article
      Israeli soldiers reveal systematic destruction of Palestinian property to create Gaza buffer zone Israel’s strategy may have another purpose; to make life so unbearable for Gazans crammed into an ever-smaller pocket of territory without proper shelter that they begin to head for the exit. Katz suggested as much when he said: “We are working to advance the plan for the voluntary migration of Gaza’s residents, in accordance with the vision of the US President,” referring to Donald Trump’s controversial plan to relocate Palestinians in Gaza and redevelop the territory. At the White House last Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel was “enabling the people of Gaza to freely make a choice to go wherever they want.” Trump had “put forward a vision, a bold vision, which we discussed as well, including the countries that might be amenable and are amenable to accepting Palestinians,” Netanyahu said. But at least in public, Trump showed little enthusiasm for following through on that vision. For civilians, the unrelenting misery of the last 18 months has just got a lot worse – especially as no aid has entered Gaza for six weeks. The United Nations says it has storage and distribution sites within the displacement zones. “Overcrowded shelters are in terrible condition, service providers are struggling to operate, and resources are being depleted,” OCHA said on Friday. “Everything is running extremely low: Bakeries have shut down, life-saving medicines have run out, and water production has been drastically reduced,” the agency said. It added that many of its efforts to distribute what aid is left within Gaza are blocked by Israeli authorities. Gaza’s health ministry says that 37% of essential medicines are now completely out of stock, as are more than 50% of cancer drugs. The United Nations and several NGOs, as well as civilians in Gaza who have spoken with CNN, say hunger is spreading. Israel implemented the blockade in March to pressure Hamas into accepting new terms for an extension of a ceasefire agreement which had been in place since January. But there is no sign of a new ceasefire being agreed. CNN has spoken with just a few of the tens of thousands on the move. They are exhausted and disoriented, confused as to whether to obey evacuation orders or hunker down. Thirty-year-old Faisal Jamal Faisal from Al-Shujaiya in central Gaza arrived in Gaza City with scant possessions. Speaking as drones buzzed overhead, Faisal said he had stayed at home despite one order to leave. Then an adjacent building had been struck and many people killed, and yet another evacuation order was issued. So he left. Surrounded by eight members of his family, five of them children, Faisal said: “We don’t know where we are going, wherever our feet take us. We have left everything behind us.” Gesturing towards his children, he asked: “What have they seen from life, no education, no playing, no sense of childhood?” The UN Human Rights Office says Israeli strikes have reduced the shelter available, calculating that in the three weeks since March 18, “there were some 224 incidents of Israeli strikes on residential buildings and tents for internally displaced people.” “In some 36 strikes about which the UN Human Rights Office corroborated information, the fatalities recorded so far were only women and children,” the office said. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for a response to the claim. Israel has insisted that its strikes are precisely targeted, and care is taken to warn civilians of impending military operations. That’s of little comfort to 71-year old Abu Mohammad, who suffers from glaucoma and diabetes and is now in Gaza City with nowhere to go. Visibly distressed and struggling to move, he told CNN on Friday: “Maybe this is the twentieth time we have been displaced. Life has no meaning or future, even the past has been taken from us.” Tareq El Helou, Ibrahim Dahman, Eyad Kourdi and Eugenia Yosef contributed to this report.",,0.2278306633234024
"The Israeli military has fired Air Force reservists who publicly called for an immediate return of the remaining hostages in Gaza even if it requires an immediate ceasefire, according to a statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). In a letter published in Israel’s major newspapers, hundreds of Air Force reservists and retirees said the IDF is fighting a war for political purposes without a military goal. “At this time, the war mainly serves political and personal interests and not security interests,” the group wrote. “The continuation of the war does not contribute to any of its stated goals and will lead to the death of abductees, IDF soldiers and innocent civilians, and to the attrition of reservists.” The letter says the signatures include pilots and air crew. The letter didn’t call for a refusal to serve. Related article
      More than 130 Israeli reservists sign letter refusing to fight in Gaza and Lebanon The public letter is another sign of the growing discontent within Israel at the continuation of the war after 18 months and the failure to return the remaining 59 hostages still held captive in Gaza. Nearly 70% of Israelis support ending the war in exchange as part of a deal to free the remaining hostages, according to a recent poll by Israel’s Channel 12. Israeli reservists have become increasingly vocal since Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas last month and returned to war, feeling the personal and financial strain of multiple tours of reserve duty and questioning the Israeli government’s commitment to negotiating a return of the hostages. The simmering frustration is a potential issue for a military that relies heavily on reservists in wartime. The IDF Chief of Staff and the Air Force commander decided to fire the reservists who had signed the letter, including those who in active service. It’s unclear how many of the hundreds of signatories are active or reserve, but the IDF said it was analyzing the list to see how many more are still in the military. “It is impossible for someone who works a shift in (an Air Force) pit to later come out and express a lack of confidence in the mission. This is an impossible anomaly,” the IDF said in a statement. An IDF official said most of the signatories are not active reservists. Reservist navigator Alon Gur, whose name appears on the letter, was permanently dismissed last month, according to the IDF, after he said on social media that Israel had reached the point where “the state again abandons its citizens in broad daylight” and “where the king becomes more important than the kingdom,” according to widespread reports in Israeli media. Gur, who posted the statement the day Israel relaunched military operations in Gaza, said he had informed his squadron commander that he was leaving the military. Related article
      ‘Going to a very bad place’: Israeli reservists who refuse to return to Gaza cite military’s destructive approach Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz slammed the letter and lauded the decision to fire the signatories. Netanyahu cast the letter as written by “an extreme fringe group that is once again trying to break Israeli society from within.” “Refusal is refusal—whether it is stated explicitly or disguised in euphemistic language,” he said in a statement. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has threatened to quit Netanyahu’s government if the war ends, congratulated the IDF Chief of Staff and the Air Force commander for ousting the “refuseniks” – a term used for those refusing to serve in the military. “This swift action is essential to make it clear that we will not again accept refusals and calls for rebellion against the IDF,” he wrote on social media. The move to clamp down on the public protest appeared aimed at stemming increasingly vocal discontent among reservists and preventing a repeat of 2023, when waves of reservists said they would refuse to serve in protest of Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul efforts Nearly all of those reservists ultimately answered call-ups they received after Israel was attacked on October 7, but that wartime unity has begun to falter as the war has dragged on.",,0.23553885519504547
"Israeli ministers have redoubled their attacks on the embattled head of the country’s security agency, claiming he is undermining the government with a politically motivated investigation into a Shin Bet agent. The agent, who has not been named, was arrested last Wednesday on suspicion of committing security-related offenses. Police say he used his position and access to Shin Bet systems to pass classified information to unauthorized parties “on several occasions.” The Shin Bet, officially known as the Israel Security Agency, is the country’s equivalent of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Related article
      Dissent against war grows in Israel’s military as reservists from elite unit join protest movement The arrest of the agent deepens an already bitter feud between members of the government and the leader of Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, who has said he will resign in the next few weeks. Ministers accuse him of mounting a number of  politically motivated investigations designed to discredit the government. The acrimony soared following the QatarGate affair, which has ensnared two close associates of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a statement on Tuesday, the Shin Bet acknowledged the leak and the subsequent investigation into the agent’s actions. It said that during the Gaza war, there has been a rise in leaks of classified information by employees of security agencies. More than 20 leaks-related investigations have been carried out, it said. Last month, Netanyahu said he had lost confidence in Bar, but the Shin Bet chief has received support from the opposition. The suspect’s lawyers say the information that he passed to a minister and two journalists was “of immense public importance” but posed no threat to public safety. Amichai Chikli, the minister who received the information from the accused Shin Bet agent, said he was a hero for passing it on. Chikli claimed the information showed that Bar “was obsessively spying on a sitting minister” and that the agent had “revealed that the parts of the Shin Bet’s investigation into the circumstances of the (Gaza) war’s outbreak that were made public present a false and distorted picture.” “Israel has never had a Shin Bet chief as reckless, arrogant, and incompetent as (Bar),” he said. The agent’s lawyers said the information he’d provided presented a more complex account of Shin Bet’s conduct before October 7 than was previously published. Hamas-led militants attacked Israel that day in 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and igniting the ongoing war in Gaza. ‘A real regime coup’ Commenting on the arrest, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said: “This is what a real regime coup looks like.” He described Bar as a “dangerous individual” who uses the agency’s intelligence and investigative tools “as instruments to retaliate against politicians and journalists.” The government voted to dismiss Bar late last month. But Israel’s Supreme Court froze the decision after the Attorney General said the firing could not proceed without the approval of a special committee. Related article
      Israeli Supreme Court freezes Netanyahu government’s dismissal of head of internal security agency Netanyahu’s Likud party portrayed the accused agent as a whistleblower who had exposed how Bar had “transformed parts of the Shin Bet into a private militia of the deep state.” The party accused Bar of working with Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, another target of right-wing ire. Yair Lapid, the head of Israel’s opposition, rushed to Bar’s defense, saying the attacks against him were “a dangerous bloodbath for him and the Shin Bet members whose fighters protect the state’s security.” “The Israeli government is a government of criminals that attacks investigators who investigate offenses against state security,” Lapid said on social media. Critics have linked the attempt to fire Bar directly to the QatarGate affair, in which court documents show the two Netanyahu associates arrested by Shin Bet are suspected of receiving money from Qatar and working to portray the country positively in the media. “When Netanyahu gets in trouble with Qatar he tries to fire the investigator,” said Yair Golan, leader of Israel’s left-wing Democrats party. “He will do everything to save himself. Himself and his mouthpieces. Netanyahu is dangerous to Israel.”",,0.3323170244693756
"Sen. Chris Van Hollen said he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador, Thursday night. “I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” the Maryland Democrat said in a post on X, sharing a photo of the two seated together at a table. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.” Related article
      Appeals court backs judge in Abrego Garcia case, saying Trump DOJ ‘would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness’ Abrego Garcia will remain El Salvador’s custody following the meeting, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said in a Thursday night post on X. “Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele said. The Salvadoran president posted several photos earlier of Van Hollen shaking hands with Abrego Garcia and the two seated alongside a third man. In a swipe at Democrats critical of Abrego Garcia’s incarceration in El Salvador’s maximum-security prison, CECOT, he wrote: “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!” CNN has reached out to Van Hollen and Bukele’s offices for more information. The senator declined to provide additional details to CNN en Español about the meeting as he departed a hotel in the capital San Salvador Thursday night, adding that a full readout would be given Friday. The US lawmaker traveled to the Central American nation on Wednesday in a push for the man’s release. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and in the weeks since, his case has become a flashpoint in the fight over the Trump administration’s hardline deportation push. Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, celebrated the meeting on Thursday night. “My children and my prayers have been answered. The efforts of my family and community in fighting for justice are (being) heard, because I now know that my husband is alive. God is listening, and the community is standing strong,” she said in a statement. Thursday night’s meeting came after Van Hollen earlier in the day said he was denied entry to CECOT when he tried to check on Abrego Garcia’s “health and wellbeing.” He previously told reporters in San Salvador that he had been “stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about three kilometers” from the notorious CECOT prison, where he had driven with Chris Newman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and mother. Van Hollen said that denying Abrego Garcia access to his lawyers “is a violation of international law.” “El Salvador is a party to the international covenant on civil and political rights. El Salvador has signed and ratified that covenant. And that covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said. Van Hollen’s attempt to enter CECOT came a day after El Salvador’s vice president denied him access following an in-person meeting. Salvadoran authorities have not formally charged Abrego Garcia, and are not bound by a strict timeline to do so, according to a high-level source close to Bukele, under the country’s ongoing state of exception, which suspends certain constitutional rights. While Abrego Garcia had not been legally in the US prior to his deportation, a 2019 court order said he could not be returned to El Salvador and the Trump administration admitted in court documents he was deported there due to a clerical error. In recent days, however, Trump administration officials have denied that he was mistakenly deported. US officials have alleged he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which the administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization – a claim his attorneys dispute and at least one federal judge has voiced skepticism toward. “Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist,” White House spokesman Kush Desai wrote on X Thursday after news of the meeting between Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia broke. “It is truly disgusting. President Trump will continue to stand on the side of law-abiding Americans.” Van Hollen on Thursday again accused the US government of violating Abrego Garcia’s right to due process and emphasized that was his reason for traveling to El Salvador. “I am not here to vouch for any particular set of facts or claims, but I am here to vouch for the judicial system in the United States, which guarantees individuals the right to due process,” he said. Other Democratic delegations, he said, are “in the works now,” and while a Republican congressional delegation had recently been allowed to visit CECOT, Van Hollen said: “They did not ask to meet with Kilmar. That was not part of their mission.” Van Hollen said he also met with the US Embassy team during his visit, as well as representatives from DHS, FBI, and DEA to discuss joint efforts between the United States and El Salvador to “crack down on transnational gangs like MS-13.” This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

"Hamas is “studying” an Israeli proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza that would see 10 hostages released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, an official with the militant group told CNN. The proposal, received by Hamas on Monday, outlines an initial framework for a 45-day truce in the Palestinian enclave during which the two sides would aim to negotiate a permanent ceasefire, according to the official. Related article
      Israel’s political leaders steering ceasefire talks frustrate mediators The Israeli proposal also calls for the disarmament of Gaza, previously a red line for Hamas. It does not include a guarantee of a permanent end to the war, which Hamas has demanded as part of a comprehensive agreement. The Hamas official said the group will not agree to any Israeli ceasefire proposal that calls for its disarmament or sees Israeli forces return to Gaza after an initial withdrawal, making it unlikely that the group will accept it. The offer marks Israel’s first proposal to bring back hostages from Gaza since it resumed the war in March. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hostage families and a growing number of military reservists to reach a deal. CNN has reached out to Israeli officials for comment. Under the proposal, Israeli American Edan Alexander would be released on the first day of the truce as a “special gesture” to the United States, the Hamas official said. Hamas released a propaganda video over the weekend in which Alexander appealed directly to Trump, asking why he hasn’t been released yet. The three-minute video, almost certainly filmed under duress, is the second proof-of-life video of Alexander since the war began 18 months ago. However, Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed on Tuesday that they have lost contact with the militants holding Alexander, after they said the Israeli military bombed the location where Alexander was being held. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. The militant organization did not say when or where the strike happened. The Israeli military and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Al-Qassam Brigades previously lied about the fate of at least one hostage. In November, the group claimed that an Israeli woman it was holding hostage had been killed in an Israeli bombing and released a photo of her body wrapped in a red-stained white sheet. A tattoo identified the women as Daniella Gilboa, an Israeli soldier. Gilboa was released by Hamas alive in January. The Hamas official speaking about the Israeli proposal said that a further nine Israeli hostages would be released in two stages in exchange for 120 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and more than 1,100 detainees held without charge since October 7, 2023, the official added. Israel’s proposal also demands that Hamas provide information about the remaining living Israeli hostages held by the group, “in exchange for information about the Palestinian detainees,” and the release of the bodies of 16 deceased Israeli hostages in exchange for the remains of 160 deceased Palestinians held by Israel. The “temporary ceasefire lasting 45 days” would also include the cessation of military operations and the entry of aid into Gaza as well as “an agreed mechanism to ensure that aid reaches only civilians,” the Hamas official said. The proposal would also include the entry of equipment necessary for sheltering Palestinians displaced in Gaza. A Hamas delegation met with Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Cairo over the weekend. Israel has not publicly acknowledged whether it sent a team to the negotiations. Since early March, Israel has cut Gaza off from the supply of humanitarian aid including food, with aid agencies warning that the situation for the strip’s 2 million civilians has deteriorated dangerously, only worsened by intensive Israeli military operations. Israel’s move to block aid came ahead of its renewed military offensive in the enclave, in what it said was a bid to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and impose new conditions on a ceasefire that was in effect at the time. More than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since mid-March, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave. Under the new ceasefire proposal, the Israeli military would withdraw for seven days from parts of Gaza including the southern city of Rafah, some areas of the north and the east of Gaza City, according to the Hamas official.

      Mother of Israeli hostage Alon Ohel warns that he is in urgent need of medical treatment Israel’s proposal also “stipulates the disarmament of the Gaza Strip” and negotiations on a “declaration of a permanent ceasefire,” to begin on the third day of the truce, the official told CNN. “Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire should be completed within 45 days,” after which the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas, both living and deceased, would be released to Israel, the official said. “If an agreement is reached on the temporary ceasefire, it can be extended under conditions and for a duration agreed upon by the two parties… if the period ends without an agreement, it will be extended in exchange for new prisoners.” Some details outlined by the Hamas official appeared to match aspects of the proposal earlier confirmed to CNN by a senior Israeli official. ‘Steps are underway’ to reach a deal The Israeli official previously told CNN that the latest proposal from Israel would demand the release of 10 hostages from Gaza, as well as the release of Alexander as a gesture to President Donald Trump. According to the Israeli official, the proposal would include phases during which Hamas would provide information about all the other remaining hostages. Related article
      Israeli strike leaves Gaza City’s last fully functioning hospital out of service as offensive escalates On Sunday, Netanyahu’s office said that “steps are underway” to reach a new hostage-ceasefire deal in Gaza, while speaking to the family of hostage Eitan Mor. One of the groups representing hostages’ families, the Tikva Forum, confirmed the conversation and said that Netanyahu had updated the Mor family “on the progress of the negotiations for the release of 10 abductees alive.” Netanyahu, who visited Israeli troops in northern Gaza on Tuesday, said Israel was “determined to achieve all our war goals.” “We insist that they release our hostages,” he said while in Gaza. Israeli media have also reported that the negotiations are for the release of 10 hostages, but the prime minister’s office has not confirmed the number. CNN is working to confirm other details of the proposal that were laid out by the Hamas official. Also on Sunday, senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi said on Telegram that while Hamas had a positive attitude to any proposal “based on halting the aggression and the withdrawal of occupation forces… we will not accept a shift toward a fragmented process limited to a food-for-prisoners (hostages) deal.” CNN reported last week that mediators have been frustrated by Netanyahu’s decision to push aside career national security professionals who were leading Israel’s delegation in the talks in favor of his closest adviser, Ron Dermer. They say the move has slowed down the discussions to resurrect the broken ceasefire.

"The increase in high-profile cases this year has led to 67 judges being provided “enhanced” security measures by the US Marshals Service and the office that runs the federal judiciary, according to a letter to Congress seeking additional funds. The Judicial Conference outlined the threat in a letter to House Appropriates Committee warning of a funding shortfall and asking for money for court security. “Currently, 67 judges are receiving enhanced online security screening services provided by the Administrative Office and U.S. Marshals Service due to the judges’ involvement in high-profile cases or rulings that have garnered attention in the media and on social media platforms,” the letter said. Additionally, the US Marshals have had to take, “extraordinary measures to ensure the safety of judges,” in some cases. “We have significant concerns about our ability to properly secure federal courthouses given current resource levels,” the letter said, signed by Chair of the Committee on the Budget Amy J. St Eve and Secretary Robert J. Conrad Jr. “The Judicial Branch requested $797 million for Court Security in its December 2024 funding appeal,” the letter states. “Consecutive years of flat security funding comes at a time when threats against federal judges and courthouses are escalating, making this situation unsustainable in the current environment.” The letter from the conference cites a warning from Chief Justice John Roberts outlining the rise in threats directed at the courts and judges. “As Chief Justice Roberts noted in his 2024 year-end report, there has been a significant rise in threats to the courts, including direct threats against individual judges. Some of these threats have necessitated additional security measures by the U.S. Marshals Service, and approximately 50 individuals have been criminally charged in connection with threats,” the letter said. The letter comes as federal judges across the country have been taking on cases related to challenges the Trump administration is facing on their policies. St. Eve and Conrad emphasized at the end of the letter the importance of the judicial branch and that they cannot control the workload the federal legal system receives. “This is a broad mission that depends on sufficient funding from Congress to carry out,” the letter states.",,0.19611962139606476
"Last month a private jet belonging to Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff winged its way from Abu Dhabi to Doha to Moscow and Baku, before finally flying to Florida, where Witkoff briefed President Donald Trump on his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin — all within the span of a few days. It was just another week for Witkoff, whose globetrotting is now taking him well beyond his original job as it becomes increasingly clear that he has what few others, if any, in the administration do: the absolute faith of President Trump. The pace in recent weeks has not abated. Witkoff met with Ukrainians and Europeans in Paris on Thursday to discuss driving an end to the Ukraine War, before he was scheduled to zip over to Rome for a second round of talks with Iran to pave the way for a possible nuclear deal. In three short months, Witkoff has become Trump’s defacto point-man on some of the most urgent foreign policy challenges facing the new administration. His expansive remit has at times verged into territory usually reserved for secretaries of state and CIA directors. For someone who’s never worked in government, that’s raised questions in Washington and abroad over how Trump views the other more traditional and experienced foreign policy hands on his team — and whether Witkoff is truly equipped to operate at such a high level on the world stage.

      US will abandon Ukraine peace efforts ‘within days’ if no progress made, Rubio warns “Very few people outside the White House inner circle have worked with him. He operates as quite the lone ranger,” said a longtime US official who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity in order to talk freely. “Doing this shuttle diplomacy without a single expert is definitely unusual. I really can’t explain that. It’s odd and it’s not ideal.” Though it’s early going, so far results have been mixed. Witkoff has been unable to resurrect the truce in Gaza that fell apart last month. Russia has so far rejected the ceasefire the US called for in Ukraine over a month ago. And this week, the Iranian foreign minister called Witkoff’s shifting position on their nuclear program “contradictory and conflicting.” On the Ukraine front, frustration is mounting over the lack of progress. Speaking to reporters on Friday from Paris, where he was joined by Witkoff for high-level talks with European and Ukrainian officials, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US could end its efforts to seek peace. “If it is not possible to end the war in Ukraine, we need to move on,” Rubio told reporters before departing Paris. “We need to determine very quickly now, and I’m talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable.” Comparisons to Kushner Witkoff, a New York real-estate developer whose relationship with Trump stretches back decades, is the closest person to family serving in the president’s second term — leading some sources familiar with their dynamic to compare his role to the one Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had during Trump’s first administration. Like Kushner, Witkoff sees the president almost daily, texts with Trump’s family members, has walk-in privileges to the Oval Office, and enjoys a longer leash than nearly anyone else in the Trump administration, sources explained. That operational freedom though has at times led to some internal chaos — like when Witkoff books himself for TV interviews, a process that typically runs through the president’s national security team. White House communications director Steven Cheung pushed back saying in a statement that every media booking runs through the White House. As Witkoff’s responsibilities have expanded — first handling Gaza talks, then adding Russia and now leading on Iran – he has grown to rely on a small team of officials at the White House and has become a regular consumer of US intelligence, sources said. Witkoff also takes no salary from the US government and pays for travel on his personal plane without reimbursement from the federal government, according to an administration official. Witkoff expects to log more than 1,000 hours this year on his efforts for the Trump administration, the official added. Witkoff has some of the trappings of a traditional special envoy’s office but in many ways ignores them. At the White House, he keeps his own West Wing office—the one that belonged to Ivanka Trump in the first term—so that he can be closer to Trump. Meanwhile, about a mile away at the State Department, some of Witkoff’s small but expanding team works out of a space last used by John Kerry when he was President Joe Biden’s climate envoy. While he initially intended to work out of the State Department, the unexpected calls into the Oval Office that come most afternoons have anchored Witkoff in the White House, sources said. That at times leaves his team of less than a dozen officials at the State Department operating with little information. They often don’t know Witkoff’s daily schedule – which sources close to him say may be a product of that agenda evolving by the hour. They also sometimes don’t get advance notice of Witkoff’s planned engagements, including with Putin and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, multiple sources said. An outsider and deal maker Witkoff’s close relationship with Trump has given him immense cache when he engages with foreign diplomats. “We know he is talking for Trump so conversations with him are extremely valuable,” said one foreign diplomat in Washington. A Middle Eastern official who has worked with Witkoff praised him as a “smart negotiator” and said his go-it-alone approach can result in “efficient and effective execution of deals.” “No doubt he’s on a learning curve, but he is not afraid to learn and very open for considerations and angles he had not previously seen,” the official said. In a statement to CNN, Rubio, who works closely with Witkoff, offered his robust support. “From spearheading efforts to bring Americans home to his commitment to restoring peace across global conflicts, Steve has been an incredible leader in the America First movement,” Rubio said. “He has shown tremendous passion and has employed innovative ways to advance our national interests at home and abroad. The American people are better off for the contributions he has already made in just three months as part of this administration.” Still, questions remain over how much Witkoff will use the team that is being built for him, and how effective he will ultimately be in driving negotiations that produce major deals. Speaking privately to CNN, a number of career US and European diplomats were skeptical of Witkoff’s ability to deliver final agreements that, whether it’s Gaza, Ukraine or Iran, will inevitably require extensive discussion of complex technical details. “This is somebody who appears to be launching out on his own with no diplomatic experience,” said one veteran US diplomat who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity in order to talk candidly. “On the Russian side he is up against very experienced diplomats and operators,” the person said. “The concern is that you have someone who is outmatched by his counterparts and that is not a good place to be.” Sources close to Witkoff say he is happy to hand off nitty gritty technical negotiations and that he has no interest in trying to own the entire process on any of these fronts. On Ukraine though, Witkoff has raised concerns among some American and foreign officials with his habit of praising Putin and erring on the Russian leader’s position. Related video
      Steve Witkoff might be ‘inadvertently trying to push pro-Russian narratives,’ says Ukrainian MP “I think that Mr Witkoff has taken the strategy of the Russian side,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday. “I think it is very dangerous because he is consciously or unconsciously, I don’t know, disseminating Russian narratives.” Those points are sometimes repeated by Witkoff behind closed doors in meetings with senior Trump officials, “certainly to the discomfort of some in the room,” the longtime US official said. “Witkoff seems very susceptible to certain Russian narratives, and that’s a real problem.” Sources close to Witkoff say he is aware of the criticism that he is a novice to diplomacy, but that he also believes that not having the training of career diplomats comes with benefits. “He is not new to dealing with foreign actors, he has dealt with them throughout his real estate and business career,” said one source close to Witkoff. “What is new is that he is dealing with them for the US government. But it still requires a level of trust to get anything done,” the person said. Cheung said that Witkoff doesn’t have “ulterior motives” which has boosted his efforts, and some Trump allies argue an outsider is exactly what is needed in these types of negotiations. “He’s an outsider, but that’s what makes him such a good deal maker,” said Ohio Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, who got to know Witkoff and his family closely during Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. “We need to reject that old mindset with a new outsider’s view on all these things. And that’s exactly what Steve’s doing, and that’s exactly what’s needed.” A trusted member of Trump’s inner circle Second only to himself, Trump believes Witkoff is the ultimate deal maker. He thinks their shared background in the real estate business as developers makes them similar in their approach to foreign leaders, Trump administration officials and people close to the president told CNN. That’s in large part how Witkoff landed what has become one of the most crucial and legacy-defining roles of Trump’s second term. Trump initially gave Witkoff the Middle East portfolio because he wanted to find his friend a meaningful role in his administration – and knew he had connections to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Middle Eastern officials thanks to his business dealings, sources close to both the president and Witkoff told CNN. But Trump was so pleased with how Witkoff pushed through the initial ceasefire and hostage agreement — struck in the final days of the Biden administration — that he directly told Witkoff to serve as a chief negotiator for talks between Russia and Ukraine, and now Iran, the sources said. “Witkoff proved early on that he had the chops to be a dealmaker,” a second Trump administration official said. “He helped reached a breakthrough where others couldn’t. That success led the president to give him more jobs.” After Trump lost the 2020 election, Witkoff was a constant presence in his inner orbit, even as many former allies abandoned him. During the 2024 campaign, Witkoff grew close to many of Trump’s most senior advisers, including Susie Wiles, Trump’s campaign manager and now White House chief of staff, sources familiar with their relationship said. “Witkoff doesn’t just have the trust of President Trump. He has the trust of the president’s entire family, and the trust of the president’s closest aides,” a person close to the Trump family told CNN. “Steve is someone who stood by Trump when it was tough to stand by him.” Donald Trump Jr., who has become close personal friends with Witkoff and a key advocate of his role in his father’s administration, is effusive in his praise for Witkoff. “Not only is Steve Witkoff one of the most amazing businessmen of this generation, but he’s also one of the most decent human beings you will ever meet,” Trump Jr. told CNN. “When a lot of fake friends ran for the hills after the 2020 election, Steve always stayed loyal to my father and our entire family and that is something we will never forget.” Added Trump Jr,  “No one is better suited to lead peace negotiations in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine than he is. His ability to cut deals and succeed in tough negotiations is second to none and America will be better off because of his hard work.” ‘Steve can handle it’ When preparing for his overseas engagements, Witkoff doesn’t ask for a thick briefing book or a series of departmental briefings to be setup. Instead, he relies on his almost daily communications with the president, impromptu meetings, interactions with members of Trump’s National Security Council and his now-regular intelligence briefings as the primary sources of preparation, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Witkoff takes two identical notebooks with him everywhere, the source added. One is for general information; the other is for more sensitive information. Witkoff’s small circle includes his girlfriend, Lauren Olaya, a former professional golfer who joined Wikoff at Trump’s inauguration. Olaya often accompanies him on visits to sensitive engagements, flying with him on his private jet, two sources explained.  She also joined Witkoff on his second trip to Moscow, one person said, but does not attend Witkoff’s meetings with foreign leaders and top officials. She does, however, often serve as a sounding board for him, the sources said. Witkoff initially told people that he would remain in the role for a year, though sources say that he has indicated that he will stay around until he crosses the finish line on deals he has been tasked to clinch. And while there are no current plans to expand Witkoff’s role, US officials say that it is not out of the realm of possibility – especially as questions arise about who might lead discussions with China. “Steve can handle it,” Trump and his national security team often joke when discussing a wide range of topics, explained a source familiar with the matter.

"GOP-led states are barreling ahead in a push to require voters to show documents proving their citizenship when registering, as efforts by President Donald Trump and his congressional allies to enact the mandate nationwide show little likelihood of success. Twenty-two states have considered proof-of-citizenship legislation this year, with Wyoming last month becoming the latest to enact such a policy, according to the Voting Rights Lab, which tracks election-related legislation. That’s a dramatic increase from the six states that weighed these kinds of bills just four years ago – underscoring an intensifying campaign by some Republicans to elevate an issue that voting experts say is virtually non-existent – foreigners infiltrating the US voting rolls. In recent years, hard-right activists have claimed, without evidence, that voting by noncitizens is fueling fraud and affecting election results. The state-by-state legislative push comes as national Republicans from Trump on down have made the proposal a top agenda item, even as those federal efforts face serious legal, legislative and logistical obstacles. The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives last week passed its own proof-of-citizenship bill, reprising an effort that began last year. However, the bill faces a near-impossible hurdle in the Senate, where Republicans lack the votes to overcome an expected filibuster by Democrats. Last month, Trump – who has made repeated and baseless claims that fraud contributed to his 2020 defeat – sought to single-handedly change how local governments and states carry out elections with a sweeping executive order that included several provisions aimed to boost proof of citizenship requirements, amid attacks on other state policies for how elections are administered. Several lawsuits are challenging Trump’s order, arguing that his actions amount to an unconstitutional presidential overreach into elections. And the administration is now claiming in court filings that Trump’s directive that a federal elections commission do what it can to encourage the adoption of proof of citizenship requirements was more of a “proposal” that would need to go through many more procedural steps – including gaining the support of at least one Democrat on the relevant commission – before becoming reality. But even if it ends up lacking any real teeth, the executive order is a clear signal to Republican state legislators, voting rights experts told CNN. “The president is clearly telecasting that this is what he wants his allies across the country to be advancing,” said Liz Avore, a senior adviser to the Voting Rights Lab, which tracks election-related legislation. It’s already against the law for noncitizens to vote in federal elections and those who do risk jail time and deportation. Currently in most states, voters confirm their citizenship by signing a sworn statement. Critics argue that requiring people provide proof, through documents such as birth certificates or passports, to register to vote could disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans who might lack ready access to those documents and could be improperly kicked off the voting rolls. One recent survey conducted by SSRS for the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, VoteRiders and other groups showed that roughly 9% of eligible voters – estimated at more than 21 million people – would have a difficult time obtaining the required documents, and 2% lack access to them altogether. It is rare for noncitizens to vote. An audit of Iowa’s rolls of 2.1 million registered voters released last month found 277 noncitizens on the rolls and concluded that 35 had cast ballots that were ultimately counted in the 2024 general election. Litigation over a Kansas attempt to implement a 2011 mandate in that state revealed that 31,000 Kansans were denied registration because of failure to provide a citizenship document in the roughly three years the law was in force. Opponents say the GOP-led efforts could suppress voting, particularly for poor and older voters and create additional obstacles for women who change their names after marriage because their birth certificates or other documents establishing their citizenship might not match their current last names. Republican supporters of the bill that recently passed the US House said states can help affected people overcome those barriers by choosing to include additional records, such as marriage certificates, to the list of documents they will accept in verifying citizenship. ‘I just don’t carry around my passport’ The effort to pass proof-of-citizenship statutes around the country is advancing alongside a campaign by conservative activists to change state constitutions to require US citizenship to vote, although it already is illegal for noncitizens to do so in presidential and congressional contests. (Washington, DC, and some municipalities in three states – California, Maryland and Vermont – have allowed permanent, legal residents to vote on local issues.) Eight states last year approved measures adding a citizenship requirement to their constitutions, bringing the total number of states with explicit prohibitions in their constitutions to 15, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The challenge in enacting the mandate is that most states, under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, are obligated to accept, at least for federal elections, a federal registration form that has not included citizenship documents among its requirements. As a result, Arizona – which first pursued a citizenship mandate more than two decades ago – set up a dual system for elections to implement its proof-of-citizenship law, establishing a separate a “federal only” list of voters who have not met the state’s mandate and so are barred from voting for state and local offices, but can vote in federal elections. New Hampshire, like Wyoming, is exempt from the relevant provisions of the 1993 federal statute because it allows people to register on the same day that they vote. New Hampshire has a new proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in place for elections for the first time last month and will apply to all elections, including those for federal office, in a state that plays a key role in presidential politics. Reegan DePasquale, who moved to Hampton, New Hampshire, from Florida last December, said she recently became ensnared by the new provisions. She said she showed up to register and vote in her town’s March 11 election at roughly 5 p.m. – after finishing work and picking up her elementary-age children from their after-school activities. But DePasquale said she wasn’t aware of the law’s details and had only her driver’s license and US Global Entry card in her wallet as proof of her identity. Given the late hour – and realizing that she still needed to feed her kids dinner and get them settled for the evening – she gave up on retrieving her passport from her home and returning to vote before polls closed. “It was frustrating,” DePasquale told CNN. “I just don’t carry around my passport and birth certificate with me.” In all, at least 96 people appeared to have had problems voting during that day’s election because of the law, according to the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights – a coalition that monitored activity at nearly two dozen polling places. Liz Tentarelli, president of the New Hampshire League of Women Voters, said lawmakers in other places should view the Granite State’s recent experience as a “cautionary tale.” “There will be people turned away, and if that’s what a state wants, it’s a mistake,” she said.  “We should not be creating laws to disenfranchise.” New Hampshire state Rep. Bob Lynn, a Republican who authored the bill that requires proof of citizenship, said voting appeared to go smoothly for most residents. “It’s too bad that you didn’t familiarize yourself in advance with what you needed to do” to cast a ballot, he said of cases like DePasquale’s. “That’s what the law is.” The new law also prohibits the use of sworn statements, which attest to a voter’s qualifications if they show up at the polls without the required documentation. “We shouldn’t have a trust-me situation for voting,” Lynn, the former chief justice of the state’s Supreme Court, told CNN. “If you forget your ATM card and go to the bank and want to make a withdrawal, the bank isn’t going to let you sign an affidavit, saying ‘My name is really John Smith, and I really have an account here.’” New Hampshire lawmakers are now weighing another bill drafted by Lynn that would extend the proof-of-citizenship mandate to those who vote by mail. Proof-of-citizenship proposals advance in big states Some of the country’s most populous states also are moving to change their laws. One bill advancing in the Florida legislature would require first-time registrants to verify their citizenship status with one of seven forms of identification, including a birth certificate, passport or naturalization document. But proof of citizenship also would be needed to make changes to existing voter registrations, such as updating an address. And in Texas, the state Senate this month approved a bill that would require proof-of-citizenship documents to register to vote.  The measure would apply not just to new voters but to the 18 million people already on the Texas voting rolls, by mandating that election officials use federal and state databases to determine the citizenship status of existing voters. “Most of us agree that US elections are for US citizens,” Texas state Sen. Bryan Hughes, the bill’s author, said during floor debate this month. “However, the federal government has prevented states from requiring proof of citizenship at the point of registration.” Those whose citizenship could not be verified would receive a “limited federal ballot,” allowing them to vote only for congressional candidates. Under the proposal, those voters would be barred from participating in presidential, state and local elections. The “limited federal ballot” provision is likely to become a flashpoint in legal battles should the Texas measure become law. Courts blocked a similar attempt by Arizona last election cycle to exclude people who can’t prove their citizenship from casting ballots for president, though the litigation hinged on the federal form not requiring the documents, which Trump now seeks to change in his executive order. In earlier rounds of lawsuits over Arizona’s requirement, the US Supreme Court has mandated that states accept for federal elections a generic voter registration form offered by the US Election Assistance Commission or EAC, which currently does not require documents proving citizenship. Trump’s new executive order orders the agency to amend the form, with the goal of making it easier for states to implement the requirement. However, as the Justice Department tries to fend off the legal challenges to Trump’s directives, it’s arguing that the commission will have to take multiple additional steps before the form is changed to include the requirement. Among them is getting the approval of three of the four commissioners, according to a declaration from the commission’s executive director filed in court. Two of the four EAC commissioners are Democrats who are not expected to support such a move and even if Trump were to fire them, the law creating the EAC stipulates that two of its four members be of the same party of the House and Senate minority leaders – i.e. Democrats. Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school, said Texas’ effort to limit who can vote in presidential elections runs counter to federal law. “The EAC gets to change the federal form, not Texas,” he said. The various efforts under way to require proof of citizenship means “eligible American citizens will be disenfranchised in very large numbers,” Morales-Doyle added. “And that is bad policy.” Correction: An earlier version of this article listed an incorrect co-sponsor of a survey undertaken to determine voter access to citizenship documents. VoterRiders was among the sponsors.",,0.18421365320682526
"The White House on Friday morning launched a new website championing the theory that the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 was a human-made pathogen that leaked from an infectious disease laboratory in Wuhan, China. The page revives a long debate about the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic that has seen investigations by federal agencies, global health organizations and congressional committees. In January, the CIA issued a report concluding that a lab leak was likely, but with “low confidence” in that judgment, paralleling similar conclusions from the Energy and State departments. The CIA had previously said it did not have enough information to make a determination about where the virus originated. The World Health Organization has said it remains open to all hypotheses, including that the virus spread from animals to people in a Wuhan market. Related article
      WHO member countries agree on a draft ‘pandemic treaty’ to try to avoid COVID-19 mistakes Yet the Trump administration’s new website takes the lab leak theory even further than most of those reports, stating that the virus “possesses a biological characteristic that is not found in nature” and “if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have already surfaced. But it hasn’t.” The federal website Covid.gov, which previously linked to information about vaccines, testing and treatment, now redirects to the White House’s lab leak website. While US intelligence agencies have remained open to the possibility the virus was naturally transmitted during lab research, they nearly all previously agreed it was not genetically engineered. Many scientists believe, based on analyses of the virus and early cases, that the virus occurred naturally in animals and spread to humans in an outbreak at the Wuhan market. They’ve also said that the origin of the virus may never be proved. US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary appeared to defend the website change during a Fox News interview Friday afternoon. “I think people want some closure. The entire nightmare of Covid for three-plus years was likely entirely avoidable, had we not [been] messing with Mother Nature in a way that they should not have,” Makary said. He added that people also want answers on prolonged school closures and vaccine requirements. In several ways, the new White House page echoes a final report issued last year by the Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, linked on the site. Republican members of the committee concluded last fall that the virus originated in a lab; Democrats issued a separate report that did not draw a definitive conclusion about the virus’ origins but also pressed for more transparency. The new White House site also details perceived failures of the Covid-19 response, including “lockdowns,” mask mandates, infectious disease research funding and HHS “obstruction” of those congressional probes.

      Federal government no longer accepting orders for free Covid-19 tests Some of those officials are named. A section of the page is dedicated to President Joe Biden’s pre-emptive pardon of retired National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. Multiple Trump administration officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have railed against the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Biden administration’s response in particular. The website could tee up further action from the health agency, as Kennedy has criticized broad coronavirus vaccine requirements and controversial infectious disease studies know as gain-of-function research. Many congressional Republicans have also called for the administration to reinstitute a ban on this type of research, which can involve making a virus more transmissible or changing other traits to study its spread. A moratorium on gain-of-function studies was lifted during the first Trump administration. Biden officials last year issued policy guidance that would have put more stringent oversight on gain-of-function research, but not broadly ban those studies. The guidance is set to go into effect this May.",,0.14680449664592743
"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will not recommend invoking the Insurrection Act in a memo the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security are preparing to send to President Donald Trump about the conditions at the southern border, multiple US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. The Insurrection Act is a 19th century law that would allow the president to use active-duty troops within the United States to perform law enforcement functions such as arresting migrants. Trump issued an executive order in January declaring an emergency at the southern border that ordered Hegseth and Noem to send him a report within 90 days about the conditions there, and advising whether to invoke the Insurrection Act to help obtain “complete operational control” of the border. The deadline for Hegseth and Noem’s recommendation is Sunday, but the Pentagon and DHS are expected to send the memo with their findings to the White House next week, officials said. Hegseth and Noem are expected to tell Trump that border crossings are currently low and that they don’t need additional authorities at this point to help control the flow of migrants, officials said. Migrant crossings at the US southern border have been under 300 a day, according to a Homeland Security official — a dramatic drop from recent years when unlawful crossings were well over 1,000 or more a day. The US military has deployed thousands of additional troops, including active-duty forces, to the southern border in recent months, but they have been doing patrols, building barricades and providing logistical support to DHS — not conducting arrests. Trump officials have been frustrated with the slower pace of interior arrests across the country of undocumented immigrants, and there have been some tense calls about it between the White House and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, multiple sources said. But interior arrests often require significant manpower and resources, moreso than detaining migrants as they cross the border. Invoking the Insurrection Act and allowing US troops to get involved in arresting migrants has been viewed by some in Trum’s orbit as a way to help bolster arrest numbers across the country, one official explained. But a surge of arrests could also create capacity issues at detention facilities across the country, officials said. The US Army’s base in El Paso, Texas — Fort Bliss — has been chosen as a site to detain and house potentially thousands of migrants, and contracts have already been signed to start the construction of migrant facilities on the base, CNN has reported. But those facilities have not been built yet, and construction of tents at Guantanamo Bay to house migrants has been put on hold indefinitely.",,0.265145868062973
"The Trump administration is considering eliminating funding for two key federal programs that help millions of low-income Americans educate their young children and heat their homes. A draft of President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for the coming fiscal year calls for ending support for Head Start, which provides early childhood education and other services to nearly 800,000 kids, and for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, which assists about 6 million households with their utility bills. The move is part of a draft plan, which CNN has reviewed, to slash roughly a third of the discretionary federal health budget, eliminate dozens of programs and greatly shrink health agencies. “The budget is callous because they are not thinking about the people who will be hurt,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which works with state officials who oversee LIHEAP. “To them, it’s a numbers game. They are not recognizing the enormity of the impact on ordinary people.” Trump does not have the power to defund the programs on his own. Those decisions are up to Congress, which often does not follow a president’s budget recommendations. Still, both Head Start and LIHEAP have been rocked by other recent changes instituted by the Health and Human Services Department, which administers them. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this month laid off the entire LIHEAP staff, who disbursed federal funding to state agencies and provided them with support. He also shuttered at least five regional offices, which provided oversight and guidance to local Head Start programs, as part of his shedding 10,000 agency employees to comply with Trump’s purge of the federal workforce. The layoffs have left states and local Head Start centers scrambling to find staffers who can answer questions about obtaining the federal funds that remain for this fiscal year. Recently, the groups received notices from defendthespend@hhs.gov, an effort spearheaded by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, that ask them to justify why they need the money and how they plan to spend it. Allie McCandless, a spokesperson at the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, said, “No final funding decisions have been made.” CNN has also reached out to HHS for comment. Helping the neediest families Head Start, which celebrates its 60th anniversary next month, works with hundreds of thousands of the lowest-income families in the US. It helps children from birth to age 5 prepare for school and connect to nutrition, health care and mental health services, as well as offers parents an array of support services. More than 250,000 people are employed in the nearly 18,000 Head Start centers nationwide. Defunding the program, which receives more than $12 billion from the federal government, would also rip away free child care from parents, according to Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the National Head Start Association. “Most concerning is we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of parents (who) wouldn’t be able to work or would be forced to choose between their livelihoods and a safe, reliable place for their children,” he said, noting that Head Start’s elimination was proposed in Project 2025, a massive policy playbook compiled by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Head Start centers have already encountered hurdles under the Trump administration. In addition to dealing with the HHS staffing cuts, some centers were temporarily prevented from drawing down their federal funds in late January after the administration paused the disbursement of federal grants and loans. That forced a few to close their doors for a short time and several others to consider taking that step until their access to the money was restored. While that issue has largely been resolved, some centers are still not receiving their federal funds – forcing at least one to shutter this week and others to take out lines of credit or contemplate closing. Inspire Development Centers in rural Sunnyside, Washington, has been waiting for weeks for word from HHS about its $4.2 million award for the second half of this fiscal year. So the nonprofit made the difficult decision to close its Head Start and Early Head Start programs this week – affecting more than 400 children and 72 employees – since it would not have been able to make payroll for the latter part of April. (On Friday, Inspire received confirmation of its award and will reopen the programs on Monday.) Inspire can no longer contact the staff in the Seattle regional office since they were let go earlier this month. And the one person it reached at HHS headquarters in Washington, DC, told the center the matter was out of her control. “We’ve received no assurance at all that the balance of funds will be awarded,” said Julie Jones, human resource director at Inspire, adding that the center serves the “neediest of children,” including those with disabilities, foster youth and homeless families. Several other centers in Washington are also waiting for their funds and may have to close if the delays continue, said Joel Ryan, executive director of the Washington State Association of Head Start. “These are relatively small investments that the federal government makes in comparison to everything else they do,” Ryan said, noting that Head Start alumni tend to have better high school graduation rates and land higher paying jobs. “From a budget standpoint, it really is penny wise and pound foolish.” Assisting with utility bills Meanwhile, states are awaiting the disbursement of $378 million in LIHEAP funds, the final 10% of this fiscal year’s allocation. But HHS has only given vague responses when asked when it would release the funds, Wolfe said. That money could help an estimated 756,000 households, he said, noting that multiple states have already exhausted the heating assistance funds they’ve received. Some may not be able to provide summer cooling help, which is growing ever more important amid the increase in heat waves, or may have to scale back their programs. Already, LIHEAP only helps about 16% of those eligible, Wolfe said. And the need is great – about 1 in 6 households are behind in their utility bills and the arrears total about $21 billion. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, sent a letter to Kennedy earlier this month urging him to reinstate the LIHEAP staffers that were laid off. They voiced concerns that the action could “undermine the HHS’s ability to deliver this critical funding to low-income seniors and families” and noted that states are awaiting the final allocation of funds. Likewise, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led a group of 30 colleagues in demanding that HHS reinstate the workers and disburse the money. Until the funding is released, Steve Luxton, CEO of Energy Coordinating Agency, has to turn away Philadelphia residents seeking crisis assistance from LIHEAP to fix inoperable heaters and air conditioners. Typically, the nonprofit has enough resources to last throughout the winter and, recently, into the summer. But this year, the funds dried up in mid-February, allowing Luxton to aid only 274 households, rather than the typical number of between 500 and 600. Luxton is concerned about residents, particularly the elderly, who need air conditioning repairs over the summer. Philadelphia has the hottest average summer temperatures in the state, he noted. “This year there will be no crisis cooling program in the city of Philadelphia at all,” he said.

"This year’s White House Easter Egg roll will feature high-dollar partnerships with YouTube, Meta and Amazon, among others,  underscoring the close relationships the leaders of those tech companies have sought to cultivate with the Trump administration. The White House, through an outside production company called Harbinger, solicited corporate sponsors for the traditional springtime event on Monday ranging from $75,000 to $200,000, with the promise of logo and branding opportunities, according to a nine-page document sent to potential sponsors and first reported by CNN last month. Several major American tech companies and associations have signed up, according to an official White House press release on the event sent by the office of the first lady Friday. Related article
      ‘This is not your grandmother’s Easter Egg Roll’: White House seeks corporate sponsorships for Easter event The Egg Roll has been privately funded without taxpayer dollars for many years. All money raised by Harbinger will go to the White House Historical Association. Friday’s release highlights an “array of entertaining activities thanks to the White House Historical Association and its partnerships.” That includes, according to the White House, a “Reading Nook, courtesy of Amazon”; the “Bunny Hop Stage, courtesy of YouTube”; an “AI-Powered Experience and Photo Opportunity, courtesy of Meta”; and a “Ringing of the Bell Photo Opportunity, courtesy of the New York Stock Exchange.” Those sponsorships come as those Silicon Valley leaders, who donated to Trump’s inaugural fund, have lost billions in value as markets – from the NYSE to others across the globe – have experienced volatility as a result of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. “YouTube’s participation in the White House Easter Egg Roll has become an annual tradition, and we do so in line with the administration’s process,” a Youtube spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “Our goal is to provide an opportunity for kids to meet their favorite creators, and we look forward to having a presence once again this year.” Amazon declined to comment. CNN has also reached out to the other tech companies. The American Egg Board, which has long supported the event, is again supplying the 30,000 hard-boiled eggs, as well as a “Garden Café for Tasty Treats.” Other sponsors include The Toy Association, the International Fresh Produce Association, and the National Confectioners Association. Signature Brands, LLC, which owns the Betty Crocker brand, will provide a cookie decorating station, and GALA is hosting a digital egg hunt game. The solicitation for sponsorships marks an unprecedented offering of corporate branding opportunities on White House grounds, running counter to long-established regulations prohibiting the use of public office for private gain. Prospective sponsors were offered opportunities for “naming right for key areas or elements,” “logos featured on event signage,” “custom-branded baskets, snacks/beverages, or souvenirs,” and “mentions in official event communications and social media posts.” Upon viewing the Harbinger pitch document last month, Richard Painter, who served in the White House Counsel’s Office under President George W. Bush, told CNN that it “wouldn’t have gotten through Counsel’s Office.” “That would have been vetoed in about 30 seconds in my day,” he said. “We’re not running this like a football stadium where you get all logos all over the place for kicking in money.” This story has been updated with additional details.

"A federal judge paused the Trump administration’s efforts to lay off nearly 1,500 of the 1,700 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as she considers whether the mass firing violated a court order halting the dismantling of the agency. Judge Amy Berman Jackson will scrutinize the layoffs with an evidentiary hearing on April 28, during which there would be witness testimony, she said at an emergency hearing called Friday morning. She is ordering the administration to turn over internal documents and communications about the firings to the unions and other groups that have sued the administration over its efforts to take apart the agency. The mass layoff “is not going to happen in the meantime,” Jackson said in court. The Trump administration is appealing the order. Related card
      Acting commissioner is out at IRS after whiplash week for the agency The case is one of several where the Trump administration has been accused of violating court orders. Jackson said Friday she had “concerns” the new layoffs ran afoul of orders from her and a federal appeals court prohibiting mass terminations that would interfere with the ability of the agency, created by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, to meet its statutory obligations. The CFPB was an early target of the Trump administration’s downsizing efforts, but its undoing was largely blocked in federal court. Republicans have long wanted to close down the agency, whose creation was spearheaded by Elizabeth Warren, now a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. The CFPB’s new leadership has been reviewing the agency’s activities and staffing since February, Mark Paoletta, the agency’s chief legal officer, said in a declaration Friday. Previously, the CFPB’s activities have “pushed well beyond the limits of the law” and the agency has “engaged in intrusive and wasteful fishing expeditions.” “An approximately 200 person agency allows the Bureau to fulfill its statutory duties and better aligns with the new leadership’s priorities and management philosophy,” Paoletta said. DOGE allegedly kept staffers working 36 hours straight The legal challengers, however, submitted declarations Friday morning alleging that the layoff plans had been rushed and done without a “particularized” assessment of whether they would infringe on the agency’s statutory obligations, as required by an order last week from the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals. A member of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency kept CFPB staffers working for 36 hours straight to send out mass layoff notices at the agency, screaming at those he thought weren’t working fast enough, according to a declaration from an agency employee, submitted anonymously for fear of retaliation. Jackson indicated at the Friday’s hearing that the DOGE affiliate, Gavin Kliger, would need to be present at the April 28 hearing. The declaration also claimed that CFPB employees raised to the agency’s Chief Operations Officer Adam Martinez concerns about compliance with the court order, “but they were told that all that mattered was the numbers.” “The direction to ignore the concern came from Mark Paoletta, who said that the numbers based [Reduction In Force] should move forward, and that leadership would assume the risk,” the declaration said. How CFPB is justifying the cuts Paoletta, in his statement filed with the court, listed the agency’s various departments and how many employees were needed. For instance, the consumer response education division could function with 20 employees, rather than 149 workers. The enforcement division could operate with 50 workers, rather than 248 staffers. And the supervision division could fulfill its duties with 50 employees, rather than 487, and they could all work from the lower-cost Southeastern region. Going forward, the agency will focus on “conciliation, correction, and remediation of harms subject to consumers’ complaints,” focus on “actual fraud” against consumers and on getting money back to them, rather than imposing penalties on companies, among other areas. And it will focus on the largest banks and depository institutions. During Friday’s hearing, Deepak Gupta, an attorney for the unions, said that the layoffs the administration sought to conduct this week were larger than the ones it had tried to implement in February, before Jackson’s earlier interventions in efforts to hollow out the CFPB.

"Sen. Chris Van Hollen on Friday detailed his recent meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, saying the Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador described being “traumatized” by his time at the country’s notorious CECOT prison and has since been moved. “He said he was not afraid of the other prisoners in his immediate cell but that he was traumatized by being at CECOT and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways,” Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, told reporters at Dulles Airport near Washington, DC, after landing back in the US. The US senator said Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, told him he had been moved from the maximum-security prison to another detention center nine days ago. “He’s no longer at CECOT,” Van Hollen said. “He’s at a different prison which is pretty far outside of San Salvador.” The senator shared that the new facility is in Santa Ana where “conditions are better” but did not provide additional details. Van Hollen also claimed the Trump administration has committed to paying El Salvador $15 million to detain prisoners, including Abrego Garcia. He claimed that $4 million has been “paid out” so far. The senator traveled to the Central American nation earlier this week in a push for the man’s release and met with him Thursday – after initially being denied access to the maximum-security prison. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and his case has been at the center of the fight over the Trump administration’s hardline deportation push. Van Hollen said the case has broad significance for the due process rights of all Americans. “This case is not just about one man, it’s about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States of America,” he said. “If you deny the constitutional rights of one man, you threaten the constitutional rights and due process for everyone else in America.” While Abrego Garcia had not been legally in the US prior to his deportation, a 2019 court order said he could not be returned to El Salvador and the Trump administration admitted in court documents he was deported there due to a clerical error. A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return from CECOT, and the Supreme Court largely endorsed that order. Top Trump officials have denied that he was mistakenly deported and argued in recent days that because Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran national, he belongs in El Salvador. US officials have also alleged he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which the administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization – a claim his attorneys dispute. “He’s a citizen of El Salvador, he’s in El Salvador, he’s home,” Trump border czar Tom Homan told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Thursday on “The Source.” “He’s an MS-13 member, which is now classified as a terrorist, so we removed the illegal alien MS-13 member who has a final order removal issued by an immigration judge to his homeland.” Abrego Garcia’s lawyers maintain that he does not have ties to MS-13. President Donald Trump’s administration has seized on Van Hollen’s visit in particular to swipe at Democrats critical of Abrego Garcia’s incarceration in El Salvador. “Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention from the Fake News Media, or anyone. GRANDSTANDER!!!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Friday morning. The White House was also quick to compare an image of Van Hollen’s meeting with Abrego Garcia with one of Trump meeting with Patty Morin, whose daughter was murdered by an undocumented El Salvadorian immigrant in 2023, in the Oval Office earlier this week. “We are not the same,” the White House account posted on X. The White House said on social media Friday that Abrego Garcia is not and will “never” return to the United States. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele similarly said in a Thursday night post on X, “Now that [Abrego Garcia has] been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody.” Senator addresses ‘margaritas’ at meeting Van Hollen also addressed Bukele’s Thursday X post that Abrego Garcia had been “sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!” Salvadoran government officials, the lawmaker said, had placed the glasses on the table and the two men did not take a sip. “When I first sat down with Kilmar, we just had glasses of water on the table and I think maybe some coffee. And as we were talking, one of the government people came over and deposited two other glasses on the table with ice and I don’t know if it was salt or sugar around the top. But it looked like margaritas,” Van Hollen said. He continued: “If you look at the one they put in front of Kilmar, it actually had a little less liquid than the one … in front of me to try to make it look — I assume — like he drank out of it. Let me just be very clear: Neither of us touched the drinks.” This incident is “a lesson into the lengths President Bukele will do to deceive people about what’s going on,” Van Hollen added. The senator, further describing the meeting, said Abrego Garcia said he missed his family and that his loved ones keep him going. “He said that thinking of you, members of his family, is what gave him the strength to persevere, to keep going day to day even under these awful circumstances,” Van Hollen said, adding that Abrego Garcia spoke “several times” about his five-year-old son who has autism and who was in the car when he was pulled over by immigration agents. Recalling his first phone call with Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer, following the meeting, Van Hollen said he conveyed to her that her husband told him “first and foremost, that he missed her and his family.” “And as he said that, you could see a tear come down,” the senator added.

"Gary Shapley, whom President Donald Trump named acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service earlier this week with the support of Elon Musk, will no longer serve in the role, sources told CNN — a win for Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s office, which had opposed his appointment. Michael Faulkender, the deputy secretary of the Treasury, will be taking on the position, the sources said. Shapley had the backing of Musk and congressional Republicans, while Bessent’s office had reservations, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Bessent was out of the country when Trump appointed Shapley. Shapley’s ouster from the top leadership role, which was first reported by The New York Times, ends a whiplash week at the IRS, which is a bureau of the Treasury Department. Trump signed the paperwork appointing Shapley on Tuesday, triggering panic among some career civil servants. Shapley, who helped lead the Hunter Biden investigation, had provided whistleblower testimony to Congress as Republicans claimed partisan bias by Justice officials had hindered the investigation of the son of President Joe Biden. Republicans had celebrated his ascension at the IRS after Trump had previously named him deputy chief of IRS criminal investigations. The outgoing acting commissioner, Melanie Krause, announced Shapley’s elevation in an agency-wide email on Wednesday, according to three sources. “I’ve made the decision to step down as acting commissioner and today is my last day in the office before I transition into a leave status,” Krause wrote. “I also have the privilege of sharing that President Trump has appointed Gary Shapley as the next acting commissioner.” But days after his appointment, Shapley was on his way out of the top leadership role. Bessent wrote on X on Friday that “trust must be brought back to the IRS,” and expressing confidence that Faulkender “is the right man for the moment.” He also praised Shapley, noting that “he remains among my most important senior advisors” at Treasury and vowing that he will have a “senior government role” after completing his ongoing internal review of what the administration has described as political interference in the Hunter Biden tax fraud investigation. A Treasury spokesperson added that Faulkender “is the United States Treasury’s choice to temporarily lead the IRS during its current transition toward a more efficient, more effective agency to best serve the American people.” “We urge Congress to act quickly to confirm permanent leadership at the IRS to ensure its ability to best serve taxpayers going forward,” the spokesperson added. Including Shapley’s short-lived tenure, Faulkender will be the fifth person to lead the beleaguered tax-collection agency this year. Trump’s pick for full-time commissioner – former Missouri Rep. Billy Long – awaits confirmation in the GOP-led Senate. CNN has reached out to the IRS. During Trump’s first term, Faulkender worked at the Treasury Department as assistant secretary for economic policy. He was confirmed in March by the Senate, in a 53-43 party line vote, to be the deputy secretary under Bessent during Trump’s second term. Faulkender’s responses to written questions from senators shed light on his philosophy surrounding the IRS’ top priorities. On March 6, he wrote that the agency should “enforce the tax code in an even-handed manner” and raised concerns about “overly aggressive and poorly targeted audits that burden ordinary taxpayers and small businesses.” He also offered reassurances to Democratic concerns that Trump might pressure the IRS to do his political bidding, including that he might order audits of perceived enemies. “If confirmed, I will support the fair and impartial implementation of our nation’s tax laws, including the important safeguards against improper interference with taxpayer audits and investigations,” Faulkender said, later adding, “I will comply with all relevant laws.” He pledged to protect taxpayer privacy and said the Treasury Department “will comply with” court orders restricting the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing highly sensitive IRS databases. Some of those limitations on Elon Musk’s team have since been relaxed while legal cases play out. “The protection of tax returns and tax return information is essential to maintaining taxpayers’ confidence in the IRS and the tax system more generally,” Faulkender wrote. “I am absolutely committed to upholding taxpayer privacy rights… if confirmed, I will ensure that any access is in compliance with the statutory protections found in the tax code.” CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Shapley is still a criminal investigator at the IRS.",,0.40772733092308044
"The Trump administration this week escalated its efforts to portray the Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador as a gang member with a violent history who they say is “never coming back” to the United States. A renewed push to cast Kilmar Abrego Garcia as a violent member of MS-13 comes amid growing public outcry against his deportation, criticisms about the lack of due process afforded to him, and the US government’s resistance to facilitating his court-mandated return to the country – which could risk a constitutional crisis. Abrego Garcia’s family and lawyers have denied he’s a gang member. Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland flew to El Salvador on Wednesday to lobby for the release of his constituent, who the senator described as having been “illegally abducted.” Van Hollen met on Thursday with Abrego Garcia, who was then placed back in El Salvador’s custody. The Trump administration slammed the senator’s visit and has criticized the media and Democrats for presenting what they described as an overly rosy picture of Abrego Garcia, whom White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has described as a gang member and “apparent woman beater.” The government on Wednesday released previously unshared documents stemming from two interactions Abrego Garcia had with law enforcement or the courts system: a 2019 arrest that didn’t lead to charges or a conviction, but did result in his detention by immigration officials, and a 2021 protective order his wife filed against him alleging domestic violence, which she later decided against pursuing further after she said the couple had resolved their issues. Here is what those documents say about his previous interactions with law enforcement: 2019 arrest and immigration hearings On March 28, 2019, Abrego Garcia and three other men were gathered in the parking lot of a Maryland Home Depot when they were approached by a Hyattsville City Police detective, according to a “gang field interview sheet” from the Prince George’s County Police Department that was published by Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday. The document says two of the men – it doesn’t mention whether Abrego Garcia was one of them – “reached into their waistbands and discarded several unknown items under a parked vehicle” as the detective approached them. Two “small plastic bottles containing marijuana” were located nearby by law enforcement, according to the document. The men were taken to a police station where they were interviewed. One of the other three men was recognized by the detective as an active member of MS-13 who had a criminal history that included gang membership. Another had tattoos of skulls covering their eyes, ears and mouths, which the police document described as “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture.” Abrego Garcia, according to the documents, was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie “with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on the separate denominations,” both of which law enforcement said were also “indicative” of gang culture. An unnamed informant told police that Abrego Garcia “is an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique.” A separate Department of Homeland Security document produced after his arrest, which noted Abrego Garcia “has no criminal history,” said he was carrying about $1,178 in cash during his arrest. Documents say “officers were unable to determine” whether the fourth man was affiliated with a gang. He was released. Abrego Garcia and one of the men were described in the document as having been detained “in connection to a murder investigation,” but it provides no further information about that investigation or how either man was identified as having been connected to it. Abrego Garcia was never charged with murder. The report contains some contradictory information about Abrego Garcia; it simultaneously says he claimed and didn’t claim to officers that he was afraid of returning to his country. Abrego Garcia admitted to police being a citizen of El Salvador who entered the US illegally in 2012. He was detained by immigration authorities after that arrest. His now-wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, described hiring an attorney to get him out on bond in a declaration that was submitted to the court after his deportation last month. The pair married in 2019 while Abrego Garcia was detained. “I hired a lawyer to get him out on bond. I attended his bond hearing and was shocked when the government said he should stay detained because Kilmar is an MS-13 gang member. Kilmar is not and has never been a gang member. I’m certain of that. Because of these false accusations, he was denied bond,” she wrote. Generally, immigration judges may default to the evidence presented by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and law enforcement, leaving the onus on the individual – in this case, Abrego Garcia – to rebut the claims and prove that they are not a gang member. The immigration judge in Abrego Garcia’s case also referred to previous traffic violations in Abrego Garcia’s record. “The burden of proof is on the applicant for release in this situation. There’s a bias against release. Any derogatory information, no matter how weak, is going to tip the scales against release in that situation,” said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “The fact that there was this sketchy worksheet out there ultimately was enough to prevent his release on bond prior to a determination on the outcome of his case,” he added. While the immigration judge didn’t make a definitive finding on whether Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13, the evidence was enough to deny him release from ICE detention. Abrego Garcia remained detained while he went through further proceedings. He attended immigration hearings in August and September 2019. Vasquez Sura described the August hearing in her court declaration: “The hearing lasted over five hours and focused on two things: the false accusations against Kilmar and the risk to Kilmar’s life if he was deported to El Salvador. The hearing was continued until September because they could not get through everything.” The evidence presented in immigration court included extortion of Abrego Garcia’s family in El Salvador by a gang, including threats to kill Abrego Garcia, according to an immigration judge’s order in 2019. Abrego Garcia’s parents ultimately decided to send him to the United States amid ongoing threats. Immigration Judge David Jones found: “His testimony was internally consistent, externally consistent with his asylum application and other documents, and appeared free of embellishment,” later adding: “The court finds the Respondent credible.” In October 2019, the judge granted Abrego Garcia withholding of removal, meaning he couldn’t be removed to El Salvador over fear of persecution. The Trump administration in 2019 could have appealed the decision but appeared not to. “If they had appealed, he would’ve remained detained, but they didn’t appeal the grant, so he was released,” Bier said. 2021 protective order The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday also released a copy of a civil protective order that Abrego Garcia’s wife sought against him in 2021. Vasquez Sura later said in a statement that the couple worked through their issues and that she does not believe the petition justifies Abrego Garcia’s removal to El Salvador. In the 2021 complaint released by the government, Vasquez Sura described arguments that took place between the pair, including one that left Vasquez Sura bleeding and after which she described being “afraid to be close to him.” On Wednesday, Vasquez Sura said she sought the protective order “in case things escalated” and out of an abundance of caution after experiencing a previous relationship that included abuse. “Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process,” she said in the statement. “We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect.” She did not pursue the matter further. In court hearings that have taken place since Abrego Garcia’s deportation, the federal judge overseeing the case has repeatedly asked the Justice Department to provide additional information about Abrego Garcia, including previous charges or convictions, but the DOJ has so far not done so. The protective order publicized by the government on Wednesday is not an issue in his mistaken deportation – the 2019 order would still prohibit his removal to El Salvador – but it could serve to bolster the White House’s claim that Abrego Garcia has a history of violence, despite his wife saying it should not be used against him. 2022 traffic stop In late 2022, Abrego Garcia was also pulled over in Tennessee for speeding and had multiple other people in the car. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Highway Patrol told CNN that Abrego Garcia was flagged to federal law enforcement, “who made the decision not to detain him.” On Friday, the White House also released an investigative referral from DHS that outlined the encounter and Abrego Garcia’s immigration history. According to the report, Abrego Garcia told the officer that he was driving from Houston to Temple Hills, Maryland, to “bring in people to perform construction work,” but the lack of luggage in the vehicle led the officer “to suspect this was a human trafficking incident.” The report also said “DHS sources indicate that Abrego was identified through official law enforcement investigations as a member” of MS-13. On Friday, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security claimed that the facts surrounding Abrego Garcia’s traffic stop “reek of human trafficking” – pointing toward the number of people and lack of luggage in the car. His wife, Vasquez Sura, however said in a statement that her husband “worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites, so it’s entirely plausible he would have been pulled over while driving with others in the vehicle.” “He was not charged with any crime or cited for any wrongdoing,” she said. “Unfortunately, Kilmar is currently imprisoned without contact with the outside world, which means he cannot respond to the claims or defend himself.” CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez and Evan Perez contributed.",,0.3345043957233429
"Comedian Tim Dillon isn’t expecting a certain member of the British royal family to stream his newly released stand-up special on Netflix. And he thinks the same logic should apply to Democrats who may fault him and other entertainers for President Donald Trump’s return to power. “You can’t go to war with straight white men for four years and then ask why they didn’t vote for you,” Dillon told CNN. “That seems crazy. I’ve made fun of Meghan Markle a lot. I can’t then go, ‘Why don’t you think Meghan Markle is watching (my special)?’ I just think you have to pick your fights in a better way.” As with much of Dillon’s commentary, the provocation was delivered in the style of a punchline — but with a point that matters for both political parties as well as the fast-changing media landscape. Digital creators like Dillon — irreverent, predominately male and previously politically unclassifiable — emerged as a key force behind Trump’s victory. Democrats and Republicans alike have credited these podcasters, YouTubers and self-styled contrarians for driving support for Trump among men, particularly those under 40. It’s not yet clear if the dynamic will hold. Democrats say they’re already adapting to address corners of the Internet they have long overlooked, and Republicans concede Trump’s singular celebrity may prove challenging to replicate. Within the entertainment industry, opinions are mixed on how this new wave of influencers will wield their clout going forward. Some have pulled back from partisan politics in the wake of the election while other influential figures, like Barstool’s Dave Portnoy, have selectively criticized Trump’s performance so far. Regardless of how the two parties proceed, Dillon predicted: “You’re going to see a lot more attention being paid to the Internet.” “It was kind of fortuitous” Dillon, 40, stands near the center of the political transformation that is taking place. Though openly gay and a resident of deeply blue Los Angeles, he has few allegiances and for years his barbs mocked cultural and political establishments across the spectrum. But as the election neared, his critiques of Democrats, voiced weekly in his long-running podcast, grew increasingly acerbic. Then, less than two weeks before Election Day, he released an 83-minute interview with Trump’s running mate JD Vance – an improbable booking that remains surreal, if not absurd, even to Dillon. “It was actually the goal and why I started comedy — JD Vance,” Dillon said with his characteristically dry delivery. “I knew about him when I started out in 2010 and I had it all plotted out like ‘A Beautiful Mind’ on the wall.” Then, more seriously: “It was kind of fortuitous. We just have this podcast that’s big and people listen to it.” The elevation of comedians as political influencers has been years in the making. Stand-up comics have become some of the country’s most recognizable and highest-paid celebrities. The top 10 comedy acts of 2024 grossed nearly $400 million in tickets, up 52 percent from the year before, according to Billboard. Americans spent tens of millions of hours watching their specials on Netflix and other streaming services. Dillon’s latest release, “I am Your Mother,” rose to Netflix’s coveted Top 10 most-watched list after debuting on Tuesday. The Trump campaign, more than that of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, appeared attuned to that reality. From sit-downs with Dillon and the comedian Theo Von to appearances with the online pranksters known as the Nelk Boys, podcaster Joe Rogan and Twitch streamer Adin Ross, Trump’s team placed calculated bets on an ecosystem of influencers who may not be conventionally political but command attention — and, more crucially, loyalty — from the digital generation. “Trump understands the two cultural forces that I’ve seen in my lifetime that have changed the way people have behaved: reality television and social media,” Dillon said. “He understands social media and using it to communicate. Now that we have phones, we’re all starring in our own reality television shows. He understands that, and he was able to utilize that understanding to connect with people in a way that Kamala didn’t seem to understand. I felt like he just had the upper hand.” Democrats play catch up A post-election review of the digital landscape by the progressive media watchdog Media Matters found right-leaning online content has five times as many followers as programs on the left. Former Daily Show Host Trevor Noah is the only left-of-center voice among the top 10 most popular internet shows, the analysis said. “The Democratic Party lost control of the cultural zeitgeist and the ways in which culture is formed,” said Rob Flaherty, the deputy campaign manager and digital chief for former Vice President Harris. “What you ended up with is an online environment where all the fervor is on the right, and all the people in the middle are seeing is that fervor.” For his part, Dillon downplayed his role in Trump’s victory, and he isn’t alone in doing so. Comedian Andrew Schulz, for example, recently asserted that Trump’s appearance last year on his popular “Flagrant” podcast made the Republican’s supporters “feel more comfortable voicing how they were already going to vote” but didn’t alter their ballot. “Maybe in those situations, he feels a little less radioactive,” Schulz told the Los Angeles Times. The Trump campaign, though, certainly saw value in these appearances (Trump once appeared three hours late for a campaign event so he could tape his interview with Rogan). Democrats also clearly disagree with Schulz and are now making a push to match the right’s digital dominance. The Democratic National Committee recently announced plans to overhaul its online communications. Already, the party’s potential 2028 contenders have made early attempts to mimic Trump’s success. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshears launched competing podcasts. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmner recently gabbed on a Detroit Pistons basketball podcast while Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro talked Philadelphia Eagles and Trump with outspoken ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith earlier this year. Within the Democratic Party, some have begun to explore how to build a podcast ecosystem to rival the MAGA-friendly manosphere. More simply, some say what the party really needs is its own Joe Rogan. Already, though, Democrats have confronted the challenges of neutralizing the right’s digital advantage. A person close to Harris’ campaign said several popular online shows turned down offers to interview the Democratic nominee, including Hot Ones and podcasts hosted by the Ringer’s Bill Simmons and former NFL stars Travis and Jason Kelce, for fear of alienating Trump supporters in their audience. “Voters are attuned to when candidates are inauthentic and in 2025 there are very few Democrats who could go in there and hold their own because it’s a different part of the internet that Democrats have not lived in,” said Ammar Moussa, a Democratic strategist who oversaw rapid response for the Harris campaign. “I don’t think our solution to winning elections is as simple as finding a candidate who can go on the Nelk boys. There are larger issues. But how many Dem operatives are regularly listening to Joe Rogan or Andrew Schlutz or even know who the Nelk boys are?” Dillon is quick to point out that he also extended an invitation to Vance’s Democratic counterpart, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Rogan, Schulz and Von have publicly said they offered Harris interviews as well. Harris instead sat down with Alex Cooper’s sex-positive show “Call Her Daddy” and “All the Smoke,” hosted by former NBA stars Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, but mostly focused on rallies and high-stakes television appearances during her short three-month campaign. “I don’t do many interviews, but none of them are super contentious,” Dillon said. “They’re all just kind of a conversation. So I don’t think I would have been disrespectful in any way.” But as he eviscerated the Democratic playbook, identity politics and the country’s costal elites, Dillon acknowledged why the Harris campaign may have avoided him. “Yeah, I mean, I think I agree with Vance more than I do with Tim Walz.” As for his interview with Vance, Dillon said he wished he had pressed the Republican on the outsized influence of tech giants like billionaire Elon Musk in Trump’s orbit, which he has since criticized on his show. Dillon has also been bothered by the administration’s crackdown on foreign college students involved in campus protests against Israel. “I’m a free speech guy. I don’t love that,” Dillon said. “We always talk about these antisemitic conspiracy theories that run rampant. They’re all over the place. I think a great way to feed those theories are things like this — deporting people that have been critical of Israel.” Beyond 2024 Alex Bruesewitz, a Trump adviser heavily involved in the campaign’s digital strategy, said their approach was simply to find the online shows with the largest audiences outside of conservative media. Initially working off a list of potential podcasts recommended by Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, the campaign ultimately fielded suggestions from the president’s children or other influencers who interviewed Trump. After each appearance, Bruesewitz, a 28-year-old who served as Trump’s Gen Z whisperer and as a liaison between the campaign and online creators, would print out the metrics for Trump to review. “He loved the ratings, and when you showed him that, he would want to do more,” Bruesewitz said. “It’s not something I would recommend for all politicians, but they’re going to start doing it anyway,” he added. What remains to be seen is how these influencers respond as the political world reacts to Trump’s successful playbook. One person involved in the entertainment industry called the months since the election a “dissection period” where many comedians are anticipating a surge of invitations and requests from ambitious politicians but are still weighing how much they care to engage, if at all. For online creators, there may be limited audience payoff in serving as the new political gatekeepers. For instance, Shapiro’s appearance on Steven A. Smith’s podcast drew just 27,000 views on YouTube — a figure dwarfed by subsequent interviews in the last month with billionaire businessman Mark Cuban and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. “The entertainment business wants to make money,” Dillon said. “It doesn’t exist to teach people lessons. That’s not why it was invented. There was a belief after Trump was elected the first time that the job of the entertainment business was to act as a resistance to Trump, and it proved pretty ineffective. I think what it should be doing is entertaining people. I think that’s what it’s going to get back to doing. I don’t think it’s going to effectively marshal any type of political capital.” In his latest Netflix special — which also cracked the streaming service’s Top 10 list — Andrew Schulz made no mention of the presidential race where he briefly held a starring role. But his online show recently hosted Chamath Palihapitiya, the billionaire investor and “All-In” podcast host who has emerged as staunch defender of Trump’s tariff policies. Since speaking to Trump and Vance last year, Von has mostly interviewed other comedians and entertainers, though he did release a two-hour episode with right-wing commentator Candace Owens. Dillon’s weekly show has largely reverted to hour-long monologues, aside from a conversation with Steve Bannon, the populist strategist and former Trump adviser. Conventional Republican figures, so far, have had less luck breaking into these spaces than Trump, even amid a continued dalliance with the alt-right. “A lot of politicians have come up to me asking me to help them get on the podcast circuit,” said Bruesewitz, “And you have to tell them, ‘They don’t really want to talk to you.’” For now, that’s Dillon’s position. While he’s open to inviting presidential contenders or their running mates on his show down the line, he isn’t interested in vetting them for America along the way. “I find everyone really boring, and the only person I really am interested in hearing from is myself,” Dillon said. “That’s why my show is fun for me to do – because I just say my opinion.”",,0.24774669110774994
"For Billy Moges, the fight with a Washington, DC-area school district over the reading of LGBTQ+ books in elementary school is a matter of faith. “We have no hate for anyone,” said Moges, one of the Christian parents who sued Maryland’s largest school district over the policy in a case that will be heard at the Supreme Court. “We’re saying that we, as parents, do not want our children to be exposed to these ideas at this age because they’re not ready for it.” Related article
      Can Trump fire Jerome Powell? The Supreme Court may soon offer some clues But for the Montgomery County Public Schools and civil rights groups, giving way to Moges would lead to an administrative nightmare – requiring teachers to foresee and alert parents to any concept discussed in the classroom that might possibly conflict with their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court will weigh those positions during arguments Tuesday in the most significant religious appeal the justices have confronted in years – a case that sweeps in the struggle over transgender rights, the ability of parents to influence school curriculum and questions about the role of faith in the public sphere. The parents are relying in part on a 1972 precedent in which the Supreme Court allowed Amish families to remove their children from school after the eighth grade, despite a Wisconsin law that required students to remain enrolled until they were 16. The 6-3 conservative Supreme Court has sided with religious interests in every case it has considered in recent years – allowing a high school football coach to pray on the 50-yard line, permitting taxpayer money to be spent on religious schools and backing a Catholic foster care agency that refused to work with same-sex couples as potential parents. Moges, who created a group called Kids First to organize opposition to the district’s book policy, stresses that she’s not asking the schools to stop reading the material – only to allow parents with religious objections to opt their students out. Most states, including Maryland, already have laws in place allowing parents to pull their children from sex education, for instance. Montgomery County schools originally permitted opt-outs, but later concluded they were “unworkable.” “Some schools, for example, experienced unsustainably high numbers of absent students,” the district told the justices in a brief this month. “The need to shuttle students in and out of the classroom would, moreover, disrupt those classrooms.” A prince and a knight As part of its English curriculum, Montgomery County approved a handful of books in 2022 at issue in the case. One, “Prince & Knight,” tells the story of a prince who does not want to marry any of the princesses in his realm. After teaming up with a knight to slay a dragon, the two fall in love, “filling the king and queen with joy,” according to the school’s summary. Another, “Born Ready,” tells the story of Penelope, a character who likes skateboarding and wearing baggy jeans. When Penelope tells his mother that he is a boy, he is accepted. When Penelope’s brother questions his gender identity, their mother hugs both children and whispers, “Not everything needs to make sense. This is about love.” The school district told the court that the books are used like any other in the curriculum: Placed on shelves for students to find and available for teachers to incorporate into reading groups or read-alouds at their discretion. Moges and other parents who oppose the policy balk at the notion the books aren’t in active use. “This has never been a case about books on the shelf,” said Michael O’Brien, counsel at the religious legal organization Becket, which is representing the parents. 1972 Supreme Court precedent The Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the schools 2-1 last year, ruling that the record on how the books were being used was too scant at the early stage of litigation to determine if the material burdened the religious rights of the parents. Two judges in the majority were nominated by President George W. Bush and President Joe Biden. A third judge, appointed by President Donald Trump, dissented. Related article
      Football coach who won Supreme Court case for right to pray on the field resigns after one game The parents rely heavily on a landmark 1972 Supreme Court precedent, Wisconsin v. Yoder, in which Amish parents challenged a state law requiring students to attend school until they were 16. The families asserted that requiring school attendance beyond the eighth grade violated their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court ruled that the parents’ religious beliefs outweighed the state’s interest in enforcing the law. But the district and its allies argue that simply exposing students to ideas can’t possibly be a burden on religion. That’s because, in order to establish such a burden, the parents must demonstrate that they or their children were coerced to act or believe in a way that’s contrary to their religion. Reading about LGBTQ+ characters in a book, the school’s allies say, does neither. “Schools are charged with educating the entire population and, to do that effectively, they can’t carve up the curriculum according to each parents’ religious beliefs,” said Jason Walta, deputy general counsel at the National Education Association, which filed a brief along with other groups in support of the school district. “That is at the very heart of having a pluralistic democracy.” ‘Praying coach’ enters the debate Some of the school’s allies are quoting heavily – and perhaps counterintuitively – from a high-profile decision from the Supreme Court three years ago that sided with a high school football coach who lost his job after offering prayers on the 50-yard line. In that case, the court’s six conservatives lined up to reinstate Joe Kennedy, who became widely known as the “praying coach.” The 2022 opinion has a lot to say about what counts for religious coercion and what does not. “Learning how to tolerate speech or prayer of all kinds is ‘part of learning how to live in a pluralistic society,’ a trait of character essential to ‘a tolerant citizenry,’” Justice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative, wrote for the majority in defending Kennedy’s right to pray. “Of course, some will take offense to certain forms of speech or prayer they are sure to encounter,” Gorsuch continued, “but ‘offense…does not equate to coercion,’” he wrote, quoting from an earlier landmark opinion. Those supporting the school district predict it would be hard for the Supreme Court to square that language with a decision for the parents. Kennedy returned to his coaching job outside Seattle but then resigned after a single game.",,0.39235231280326843
"The US Naval Academy canceled a lecture that author Ryan Holiday was scheduled to give to students there last week after he refused to remove slides from his planned presentation that criticized the academy’s decision to remove nearly 400 books from its main library. Holiday, a writer and philosopher who has lectured at the US Naval Academy more than half a dozen times since 2019, told CNN on Saturday that he was invited by the academy in November to give a lecture about wisdom to midshipmen on April 14. He had previously spoken to students there, including during the first Trump administration, as part of a series on stoicism and the pursuit of virtue and excellence. But an hour before he was scheduled to give his talk last week, as he was getting ready in his hotel room in Annapolis, Holiday says he received a call from the school asking him if he could refrain from mentioning the academy’s decision earlier this month to remove 381 books from the shelves of its Nimitz Library. Related article
      Book bans are accelerating across the country amid right-wing pressure campaign “I said I couldn’t do that,” Holiday recalled. “I couldn’t have spoken in front of these midshipmen about courage and about doing the right thing, and then remove, I think, a very reasonable objection to a very egregious concept.” The Naval Academy, where students are military officers-in-training, removed the books in an attempt to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order in January mandating the removal of all “diversity, equity, and inclusion” content from K-12 schools, which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth later said also applied to military academies. The banned books include Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” Janet Jacobs’ “Memorializing the Holocaust,” and hundreds of other books dealing with issues of gender and racism, according to a database published by the New York Times. “I actually agree that the Academy should be apolitical,” Holiday told CNN. “That’s what makes this political meddling in their access to books so troubling. And then to suppress criticism of that obvious mistake, is to model even poorer moral leadership to the midshipman.” The presentation Holiday had prepared focused on US Naval Academy graduate James Stockdale, a Vietnam War hero and Medal of Honor recipient, who studied Marxist theory at Stanford in the 1960s not because he was a Marxist but to better understand the adversary The same principle should apply to today’s future military leaders, Holiday thought. The slides in his presentation, which CNN reviewed, urged students to “read critically, read dangerously,” and “read like a spy in an enemy’s camp”— a quote from the Stoic philosopher Seneca. The presentation also included quotes from Stockdale, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley — who Trump has criticized — urging students to read extensively, even if the ideas in some books made them uncomfortable. “Leaders must be independent thinkers, otherwise they are not leaders,” read one slide. The presentation also included a screenshot of a New York Times article about the books’ removal from Naval Academy shelves, and a photo of the front of Holiday’s Texas bookstore, which is emblazoned with lyrics from a Rage Against the Machine song: “They don’t gotta burn the books, they just remove ‘em.” Holiday told CNN he had sent his presentation over to the school the night before the lecture to get it loaded up onto projectors, not for prior approval. But the day he was scheduled to talk, he was asked to remove the slides mentioning the book ban after they were reviewed by senior academy leadership. Holiday said he is concerned about the message the censorship is sending to future military leaders. “If you can’t be trusted around Stacey Abrams’ memoir or Maya Angelou, you probably have no business being a Navy SEAL or holding an assault rifle or flying a fighter jet,” Holiday said. “You’re either an adult or you’re not.” “The larger point that I was trying to make is that you have to be able to think critically if you’re going to be a leader,” Holiday added. “Because if you’re not thinking for yourself, you are, by definition, not leading.” CNN has reached out to the Navy and the US Naval Academy for comment. This is not the first time the Naval Academy has been accused of censorship as it has worked to comply with the Pentagon’s new anti-DEI policies. Earlier this month, the academy had to return photos and memorabilia of Jewish women after they were “mistakenly removed” from a display—an apparent “knee-jerk reaction” because “no one actually knows what they mean by DEI content … therefore, they’re like ‘Well, let’s just take down all the photos of women,’” a person familiar with the removal told CNN at the time. There have been a number of other similar instances since Hegseth ordered the Defense Department to scrub “diversity” content from every facet of the military. Students and parents told CNN earlier this month that the policy is having a direct impact on students at Defense Department schools around the globe, as classes like AP Psychology and certain student clubs and books have been banned from DoD schools. The ACLU is now suing DoD over the policy. Articles about the Holocaust, September 11, cancer awareness, sexual assault and suicide prevention were also among the tens of thousands either removed or flagged for removal from Pentagon websites as the department scrambled to comply with Hegseth’s order. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell acknowledged in March, after an article about sports icon and veteran Jackie Robinson was removed, that some “important content was incorrectly pulled offline to be reviewed” amid the efforts mandated by Hegseth. “We want to be very, very clear: History is not DEI,” Parnell said. “When content is either mistakenly removed – or if it is maliciously removed – we continue to work quickly to restore it.”",,0.29071953892707825
"The Supreme Court early Saturday morning paused the deportation of immigrants potentially subject to the Alien Enemies Act, freezing action in a fast-developing case involving a group of immigrants in Texas who say the Trump administration was working to remove them. The court’s brief order drew dissents from conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. Attorneys for the Venezuelans at issue in the case filed an emergency appeal at the high court on Friday, claiming they were at immediate risk of being removed from the country and had not been provided sufficient notice to challenge their deportation. The court’s brief order on Saturday did not explain the court’s reasoning. The court ordered the Trump administration to respond to the emergency appeal once a federal appeals court in Louisiana takes action in the case. In the meantime, the court said, “The government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this court.” The Trump administration responded later Saturday, telling the Supreme Court it wants the authority to remove the Venezuelans detained in Texas under laws other than the controversial Alien Enemies Act while the litigation over their potential deportations continues. “The government has agreed not to remove pursuant the AEA those AEA detainees who do file habeas claims,” wrote US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the Trump administration’s top appellate attorney. “This court should dissolve its current administrative stay and allow the lower courts to address the relevant legal and factual questions in the first instance – including the development of a proper factual record.” Alito, in a scathing dissent Saturday night expanding on the one-line dissent he issued with the initial order, criticized the Court, saying his colleagues acted “hastily and prematurely” to grant “unprecedented” emergency relief to a putative class of Venezuelans. “Literally in the middle of the night, the court is­sued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” Alito wrote in a dissent that was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Sauer, in other words, argued the case had moved too quickly for lower courts to establish the facts. But as a backup argument, the Trump administration then told the high court it wants clarity that it may remove at least some of the same migrants under less controversial immigration laws. The White House said in a statement Saturday morning that “President Trump promised the American people to use all lawful measures to remove the threat of terrorist illegal aliens, like members of (Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua), from the United States.” “We are confident in the lawfulness of the Administration’s actions and in ultimately prevailing against an onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of terrorist aliens than those of the American people,” said press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Previously, a federal judge in Washington, DC, told lawyers for the migrants in Texas who believed the Trump administration is about to swiftly deport them under the Alien Enemies Act that he did not have the power to pause the deportations, even though he was concerned about the administration’s actions. “I am sympathetic to everything you’re saying, I just don’t I think I have the power to do anything,” US District Judge James Boasberg told a lawyer for the migrants at an emergency hearing Friday night. Before announcing his decision not to get involved, Boasberg pressed an attorney for the administration on whether it will move forward with the deportations Friday night or Saturday. Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign told Boasberg that while no flights are planned, the Department of Homeland Security said it reserves the right to remove the migrants on Saturday. The migrants’ lawyers also requested intervention by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees appeals coming out of Texas. “It’s hard for me to say I should inject myself into this controversy given where the issue stands in the 5th Circuit and the Supreme Court,” Boasberg said Friday. The migrants’ lawyers – counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward – turned to Boasberg for emergency relief in the initial case they brought in his court challenging President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, a sweeping 18th century wartime authority. Saturday’s decision marks the second time Trump’s use of the authority has landed at the Supreme Court. Last week, the court permitted Trump to use the authority, but said migrants being removed under it needed to receive notice that they are subject to the act and have an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained. The justices also ruled that migrants could only challenge their deportations in court districts containing the facilities where they’re being detained. The current dispute reflects how aggressively the administration is willing to act to continue deportations under the Aliens Enemies Act, which allows the government to bypass some of the protocols in the immigration statutes that typically guide the process for removing migrants in the US illegally. “We hear men are being requested to change clothes,” the migrants’ attorney said Friday, as he unsuccessfully pleaded with Boasberg to issue even a very brief pause in the administration’s plans. Contempt proceedings Boasberg has ordered contempt proceedings against the administration for allegedly defying an earlier order he issued in the case – later wiped away by the Supreme Court – that sought to halt the first round of deportation flights under the president’s mid-March invocation of the law. However, on Friday night, an appeals court issued an administrative pause on Boasberg’s plans so that it could review whether such proceedings should go forward. The unsigned order the Supreme Court issued the first time the issue reached its doorstep said that the administration must provide adequate notice to migrants so they can challenge their removals under the 18th century law. At Friday’s hearing, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt provided new evidence about the notice the migrants are receiving from the administration that they’ve been designated for deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. Gelernt said detainees received notice of their removal less than 24 hours ago, with no clear option to challenge them, and a photo of one such notice was submitted to the court. Ensign, the DOJ attorney, insisted that while the Supreme Court’s order said that the government must give notice, it did not say that government needed to offer a space to challenge the deportations. He told the court that anyone who says they want to challenge their removal is given a process to do so. “I certainly think the notice is very troubling,” Boasberg said, expressing doubt that it complied with the Supreme Court’s ruling. “But I don’t think I have the ability to grant relief,” he said CNN’s Jessie Yeung and Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report.

"A second round of high-level talks between US and Iranian delegations on Tehran’s nuclear program has concluded in Rome on Saturday, amid tempered optimism about a diplomatic way forward. Saturday’s negotiations came a week after an initial round was held in the Omani capital Muscat. Although the talks are in Italy, Oman was again acting as mediator between the US team, led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and the Iranian one, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The Trump administration expressed optimism following the talks, pointing to “very good progress” and that they had “agreed to meet again” next week. “Today, in Rome, over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” a senior administration official told CNN. Araghchi also signaled that the talks had been positive, telling reporters they lasted about four hours. “I can say that there is movement forward. We’ve reached better understanding and agreement on some principles and goals in these Rome negotiations,” he said. However, Araghchi said the nuclear deal that was reached in 2015, known as JCPOA, between Iran and world powers, including the US, “is no longer good enough for us,” in a post on X on Saturday. “To them, what is left from that deal are ‘lessons learned,’ Araghchi said, adding that “for now, optimism may be warranted but only with a great deal of caution.” Iranian officials say talks between technical experts would begin in Oman on Wednesday ahead of a third round of high-level talks on Saturday. “The two sides agreed to continue the indirect talks in [a] few days at [a] technical level to be followed by another round at their own level on coming Saturday,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said in a post on X. The third round of high-level talks will be held next Saturday, according to Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson. Oman’s Foreign Ministry confirmed that the meeting would take place in Muscat. The two countries have had decades of animosity and long been in dispute about Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Washington wants Iran to stop production of highly enriched uranium, which it believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb. Iran this week doubled down on its right to enrich uranium, but has suggested it is willing to negotiate some compromises in return for sanctions relief to ease the pressure on its hard-hit economy. The second round of talks was set up in the same fashion as the first, according to the Iranian spokesperson, with the two sides not communicating directly with one another. Instead, the delegates sat in separate rooms, with Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi mediating between the two. Witkoff and Araghchi only met briefly during the first round – not since the Obama presidency have the United States and Iran held full, direct talks. Trump ‘not in a rush’ to strike Iran The latest round was again a high-stakes engagement, and one that was preceded by a flurry of diplomatic activity as allies and adversaries alike seek to both understand and potentially influence the aims of the talks. They come against a backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East. Iran’s network of proxies across the region has been weakened by Israeli attacks and US President Donald Trump has resumed the “maximum pressure” campaign of his first term against Iran. Trump on Thursday suggested he was not eyeing imminent military strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, but the threat still looms. “I’m not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death,” he said when asked about a New York Times report that he had waved Israel off such military action.

      The US and Iran are set to meet for a second round of nuclear talks. Here’s what we know “I’d like to see that, that’s my first option. If there’s a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran,” the US president added. Ahead of the talks in Rome, Witkoff quietly met on Friday in Paris with Israel’s minister for strategic affairs and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s closest confidant Ron Dermer, and Mossad director David Barnea. The Israeli government favors aggressive action against, not diplomacy with, Iran. Netanyahu’s office on Thursday argued Israeli “overt and covert operations” were the reason that “Iran does not currently possess a nuclear arsenal.” US intelligence agencies warned that Israel will likely attempt to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, CNN reported in February. Witkoff was in the French capital with Secretary of State Marco Rubio for discussions on Ukraine, and the two discussed the upcoming Iran meeting with the so-called “E3” allies – France, Germany and the United Kingdom. “For the Europeans, they have an important decision to make very soon on snapback – on the snapback of sanctions – because Iran is clearly out of compliance with the current deal,” Rubio said on Friday. “That’s going to be a factor in all this and that’s why it was important we talk to them about it before our talks on Saturday.” Araghchi visited Moscow before heading to Rome, meeting with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, saying he expected Russia to continue its “supportive” role in any new agreement. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said during a visit to Iran that the talks are “in a very crucial” stage, adding, “we know we don’t have much time.” Since the withdrawal of the US from the Iran nuclear deal during Trump’s first term, Tehran has far exceeded the limits it set on uranium enrichment, but has maintained it is not seeking a nuclear weapon. Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud also traveled to Tehran this week in one of the highest-level trips by a Saudi official in decades. It was a visit to improve diplomatic ties between regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran and meant to signal that the Kingdom can play a role in de-escalation and brokering peace efforts, a source told CNN. This source noted that the Saudis do not know what Trump plans in the talks with Iran, and that the assessment in Saudi Arabia is that they may be unpredictable and could be short-lived.

"Less than two weeks after the Supreme Court allowed President Donald Trump to use a controversial 18th century wartime authority to speed deportations, the issue has rocketed back to the justices in a second short-fuse appeal with enormous potential consequences. The situation was entirely foreseeable. After handing down an opaque 5-4 order earlier this month that allowed both sides to claim victory, the nation’s highest court is being asked for a second time to halt the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act. That review will take place as lower courts begin to wrangle over what kind of notice the government must provide to those targeted under the act and what steps the migrants can take to fight it. In a rare overnight order handed down by the Supreme Court early Saturday morning, a majority of justices blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of immigrants in Texas. Two conservatives — Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito — dissented from the decision. live updates
      The latest on Trump’s immigration crackdown and Iran nuclear talks The court’s brief order did not explain its reasoning. The court ordered the Trump administration to respond to the emergency appeal “as soon as possible,” which it did later Saturday. In the meantime, the court said, “The government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this court.” The Trump administration responded later Saturday, telling the Supreme Court it wants the authority to remove the Venezuelans detained in Texas under laws other than the controversial Alien Enemies Act while the litigation over their potential deportations continues. And the Supreme Court signaled it is likely to say more in coming days or weeks about what will happen to the migrants at the center of several fast-moving court cases over the Alien Enemies Act playing out in courtrooms in New York, Colorado and Texas. The White House on Saturday trained its attention on the lawsuits, rather than the Supreme Court itself. “President Trump promised the American people to use all lawful measures to remove the threat of terrorist illegal aliens,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, adding, “We are confident in the lawfulness of the administration’s actions.” The White House has alleged that the people it has deported under the act are members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, but evidence proving as much has been scant. Government lawyers have cited tattoos on immigrants or clothing linked to gangs in court papers to allege criminality. An uncertain order The Supreme Court issued a murky, unsigned order on April 7 in another emergency appeal dealing with the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law Trump invoked to bypass the regular process required to remove certain people in the country illegally. The court technically allowed the administration to continue to use the controversial law — a win for Trump. And it blocked a key legal pathway civil rights groups were attempting to use to challenge Trump’s invocation of the law so they could shut down its use wholesale. At the same time, the court said migrants subject to deportation under the act were entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal through federal habeas corpus petitions — suits brought by people who claim they are being detained by the government unlawfully — marking at least a partial win for migrants.

      Supreme Court to debate if elementary schools may skip parental notice for LGBTQ+ reading How much notice? The court didn’t say. How to reconcile the fact that habeas petitions are typically filed by prisoners to seek release from detention, not to halt deportations? Near silence. And what about the more than 200 Venezuelans who were already rushed onto planes and deported to El Salvador? Not clear. To be sure, the Supreme Court is often reticent to get into details on its emergency docket — and for good reason. Often the factual record is uncertain. And the justices are usually eager to avoid changing the law without a more thorough briefing and oral argument. But the April 7 decision, perhaps prudent in its caution, nevertheless gave Trump a ton of wiggle room. The White House took all of it, claiming complete victory and starting the process of relying on the act again. Following the Supreme Court’s lead, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a series of habeas lawsuits seeking to protect identified clients as well as “similarly situated” Venezuelans who could potentially be targeted under the Alien Enemies Act. Several lower courts — including one in New York and another in Texas — issued temporary orders blocking the administration from deporting people under the act while it considers the cases. Those orders protect only migrants in the geographic regions covered by the federal courts in play. How we got here This week, immigrant rights groups said a number of Venezuelan detainees in northern Texas not covered by any earlier orders began receiving notice from the government that they are subject to deportation under the act. The ACLU has said those notices — now required by the Supreme Court — were in English, indecipherable to at least some of the Spanish-speaking detainees. The notices, the ACLU said, did not indicate how the people who received them could challenge their removal. The group said the detainees faced “imminent” removal, despite the Supreme Court’s direction that they have enough time to seek an independent review of their case. Two immigrants filed a habeas petition in a federal district court in Abilene, Texas, on Wednesday, seeking a temporary order blocking their deportation and the removal of “similarly situated” people held at the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Anson, Texas. US District Judge James Hendrix, whom Trump nominated to the bench in his first term, denied the request for the two migrants, noting the government had “answered unequivocally” that it did not intend to remove them, so they were not at immediate risk of deportation.

      Trump admin continues releasing information to paint Abrego Garcia as violent gang member as outcry against deportation grows Hendrix said he “reserves decision” on whether the ACLU could protect a wider class of unknown migrants but said he would order written arguments on that question in “due course.” Whether the groups can establish a “class” of migrants affected by the case is a technical but important point: Without a class, each migrant who receives notice of potential removal will have to file their own habeas petition and fight their case individually. Habeas petitions are notoriously difficult to win in federal court, and it will be a challenge for most immigrants to obtain lawyers. Unsatisfied with the result — and perhaps untrusting of the Trump administration to keep its word — the ACLU appealed to the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. A panel of appellate court judges in the conservative court denied the request. The migrants then turned to the Supreme Court on Friday, filing their emergency appeal with Alito, who handles quick-turn appeals from the 5th Circuit. Notably, the Supreme Court did not technically grant the ACLU’s request in its middle-of-the-night order, but it nevertheless gave the groups what they were seeking: a temporary halt on deportations at issue until it had more time to review the appeal. That decision doesn’t necessarily mean the migrants will win their case, only that they can’t be removed for now. What happens next The ball remains with the Supreme Court. In its overnight order, the justices blocked the Trump administration from taking further action on the Texas detainees until it provides more clarity. It also ordered the Department of Justice to respond to the ACLU’s request “as soon as possible.” The Justice Department did so Saturday evening, arguing the justices should deny the request to halt removals under the Alien Enemies Act. “The government has agreed not to remove pursuant the AEA those AEA detainees who do file habeas claims,” wrote US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the Trump administration’s top appellate attorney. “This court should dissolve its current administrative stay and allow the lower courts to address the relevant legal and factual questions in the first instance — including the development of a proper factual record.” Sauer, in other words, argued the case had moved too quickly for lower courts to establish the facts. But as a backup argument, the Trump administration then told the high court it wants clarity that it may remove at least some of the same migrants under less controversial immigration laws. The Supreme Court’s order Saturday did not distinguish between deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and other laws that require normal due process before removing people from the country. Sauer’s latest brief lacked much of the bluster of previous written arguments the administration has submitted to the Supreme Court and was relatively straightforward. The tone may reflect the unusual step the high court took in its order early Saturday shutting down the administration’s effort to quickly remove the migrants. Alito’s late night retort Alito, meanwhile, waited until late Saturday night to issue his dissent blasting his colleagues. “Literally in the middle of the night, the court is­sued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” Alito wrote, joined by Thomas. Alito said the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the immigrants, had “provided little concrete support” for the allegation that the migrants at issue were in danger of immediate removal. “I refused to join the court’s order because we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate,” Alito wrote.

"President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is defending the Affordable Care Act before the Supreme Court – a notable contrast to his first term, when his administration sought to repeal the law in Congress and then refused to defend it in a major challenge brought by GOP-led states. But a win for the federal government in the current case, concerning the law’s mandates that certain preventive services are covered cost-free, could boost the power that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has in shaping those requirements. It comes as Kennedy shakes up the health agency with mass layoffs and plans to consolidate huge swathes of its authorities in a new, $20 billion “Administration for a Healthy America.” Kennedy has questioned a litany of public health recommendations, and a victory in this case could put him in more direct control of at least one expert panel focused on those policies. Related article
      What to know about the Supreme Court’s midnight Alien Enemies Act order On Monday, the justices will be considering the legality of certain no cost-sharing coverage mandates that were created by a government entity known as the US Preventive Services Task Force, which issues recommendations that are supposed to be shielded from political influence. At stake is the ability of millions of Americans to access cost-free preventive services that include cancer screenings, statins that help prevent cardiovascular disease, PrEP drugs that help prevent HIV infections, and counseling referrals for pregnant and postpartum women at increased risk of depression. Cost sharing was an “enormous barrier” to people getting such care, according to Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “Simple stuff, like more people getting their blood pressure checked, more people getting their flu shots, more people getting the cholesterol screenings, more people getting some cancer screenings, like colonoscopy, breast screenings, those kinds of things,” Benjamin told reporters at a press briefing organized by the advocacy group Protect Our Care. The case is part of the latest wave of conservative legal attacks on the Affordable Care Act, but one that doesn’t threaten to take down the landmark health reform law, which has expanded health insurance coverage to tens of millions of Americans. The challengers argue that mandates are unconstitutional because, under Obamacare, they come from a task force whose membership hasn’t been Senate confirmed. A ruling in the government’s favor would leave those mandates intact for now, but the fight over how those mandates are crafted will continue, both in court and in the control that Kennedy attempts to exert over Obamacare’s requirements. “The Supreme Court ruling in favor of preserving these services is not going to end the issue,” said Andrew Pincus, a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown who filed an amicus brief supporting the mandates on behalf of the American Public Health Association. Pincus, speaking at the Protect Our Care briefing, predicted that the Supreme Court was likely to say, “that the Secretary of HHS has some authority to oversee how the task force operates and the decision that it makes.” “So, the question will then be, will HHS follow the science and uphold the USPSTF recommendations, or will it take a different course?” he said. CNN has reached out to HHS for comment. Part of a larger war over Obamacare The lawsuit was filed at the end of the first Trump administration by a Texas business and other individuals who did not want to offer coverage of certain preventive services, including PrEP medications for HIV, because of their religious and moral objections to those treatments. They are represented by Jonathan Mitchell, a well-known conservative lawyer who has been involved in other culture war disputes in court, including a significant abortion case at the Supreme Court, and who represented Trump when he was a presidential candidate in a challenge to the state of Colorado’s attempt to remove him from the ballot. The challengers’ religious liberties claims were spun off into separate proceedings. The dispute in front of the court Monday focuses on a constitutional clause known as the Appointments Clause, which establishes the president and Senate’s role in appointing and confirming officials that wield significant government power. Related video
      Top researcher quits NIH, citing censorship under RFK Jr. Lower courts agreed with the challengers’ Appointments Clause arguments, but only as they applied to one of the three different entities that issue the recommendations that become the preventive coverage mandates under Obamacare. As the Supreme Court’s weighs in on the taskforce’s constitutionality, another round of litigation will continue before US District Judge Reed O’Connor about the mandates based on the ACA recommendations of the other two entities, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and the Health Resources and Services Administration, which provides guidelines on preventive care for women and children, including annual visits and an array of screenings. Those proceedings focus on procedural questions about those mandates, rather than whether those entities’ role in the process was constitutional. Outside the courtroom, however, Kennedy has been particularly critical of ACIP, the committee overseeing vaccine recommendations. The secretary has accused the panel — typically an assembly of pediatricians, vaccine experts, and other physicians — of being too close to the manufacturers that develop those vaccines. As secretary, he could remove and replace members of the committee. Dispute over HHS secretary’s role In the dispute the justices are hearing Monday, the US Solicitor General and Obamacare’s foes will spar over the role the HHS secretary plays in deciding which of the Preventative Services Task Force’s recommendations ultimately become coverage mandates. The challengers argue that the secretary has virtually no say over the matter, and thus the task force is acting like a so-called “Principal Officer” that should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The administration argues in its briefs that the taskforce members are what’s known as “inferior officers” and that the “Secretary, not the Task Force, is ultimately responsible for deciding what recommendations will have final, binding legal effect.” The Justice Department’s current argument is a continuation of how the Biden administration was approaching the case, and “it’s every bit as legally appropriate” now, said Nicholas Bagley, a professor at University of Michigan Law School who specializes in administrative and health law. “But the ideological valence has shifted, because you’re vesting the right to make important decisions about preventive services in someone who has medical views very outside of the mainstream,” Bagley said.",,0.25261253118515015
"Democrats’ panic over what they stand for and whether they can credibly compete beyond the bluest states is already erupting in the rush to recruit Senate candidates across the country for next year — a desperate effort to dig out from years of losses that have them far from power at a moment they need it most. Will Democrats, indeed, compete everywhere in 2026? Will leaders allocate money even in tough races, or will they consolidate conservatively around their best bets? How will they handle what could be candidates who range from being aligned with Bernie Sanders to occasionally voting with Donald Trump? Even this early out from the 2026 elections, these questions are all playing out against the toughest set of Senate races Democrats have faced in decades. “On its face, the Senate map does not look great, but if this is a wave election, Democrats can compete in places they normally can’t,” said Jaime Harrison, who before his recently completed term as Democratic National Committee chair ran for Senate in South Carolina in 2020. “The goal has to be: recruit a Democrat for every damn seat.” Harrison failed in his attempt to turn a red state blue. While he raised $130 million, he still lost to Sen. Lindsey Graham by 15 points. But hopes of a major backlash to Trump, fed by internal poll numbers that operatives say show his popularity dropping, has Harrison and two dozen other Democratic operatives and candidates across the country who spoke with CNN arguing that next year’s elections could be more in line with the Democratic wave of 2006.

      Feeling out a bizarre post-presidency, Biden reemerges on the public stage Democrats have three incumbent senators who announced they won’t run again next year and anticipate at least one more will follow. They also have to defend a senator in Georgia, where Republicans keep running strong. Their most obvious opportunities to put Republicans on defense are in Maine and North Carolina, the two states that have crushed Democrats’ dreams of winning Senate races cycle after cycle. And even if they manage to win those three races, that won’t be enough to get them the majority. That leaves operatives looking beyond prime Democratic territory in states such as Alaska and even Kentucky and Mississippi, or nursing fantasies of revivals in once-competitive states like Ohio, where local leaders are waiting for Sherrod Brown to decide whether he’ll try a comeback from his 2024 loss to run for the state’s other Senate seat, or go for governor instead. And across the country, voters have doubts about what Democrats even stand for. “That’s a question I’m getting a lot,” said Wiley Nickel, a former congressman now running for Senate in North Carolina — even as many Democrats push for former Gov. Roy Cooper to enter the race against Sen. Thom Tillis. More than on ideology, voters are pushing Democratic candidates on what they’re doing to push back against Trump and whether they’d support Chuck Schumer to remain the party’s Senate leader. ‘A huge opportunity for us to write a new Democratic Party’ While strategists draft preliminary plans to blast Trump on the economy and thrash Republicans as rolling over for him no matter what, Schumer and fellow New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, chair of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, have been feeling out the strength of prospective candidates and working with local leaders to find more. But the Senate leadership is not alone in recruitment efforts. Abdul El-Sayed, who last week launched his campaign for the Democratic primary for the open Senate seat in Michigan with the immediate endorsement of Sanders, is just one of the prospective candidates around the country whom the progressive icon has encouraged into running. Smaller groups of operatives and activists are forming quiet partnerships to boost their own candidates, eager to blow past whatever decisions come out of Washington. Comparing what he’s hearing from voters to the cynicism that takes root in chronic pain patients he has worked with, El-Sayed told CNN, “It’s the morass of, ‘Everything kind of sucks,’ and our job is to take it down to its key elements.” “For too many voters in Michigan who narrowly elected Donald Trump, they didn’t know what the Democratic Party stands for,” said Mallory McMorrow, a Michigan state senator also running in the primary for the US Senate seat. Related article
      Bernie Sanders’ message of resistance finds fresh life as Democratic Party searches for direction McMorrow said her campaign is about “success, safety and sanity” rather than the status quo. “This is a huge opportunity for us to write a new Democratic Party and really put a stake in the ground, show through our race this is what the new party can look like and sound like and act like,” she said. The stakes in the Senate are much higher than just winning the majority. For those who see checking Trump’s power as an emergency for the republic, every Democratic seat makes a huge difference: Even narrowing the GOP’s 53-47 margin would amplify the pressure on the few remaining Republicans willing to buck the president. One measure of how sparse the Democratic bench is in states where they need to compete next year: Only a few House members are in the mix for Senate runs. New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas has already launched his campaign, though Rep. Haley Stevens is expected to join the open race in Michigan and Rep. Angie Craig is in the middle of a swing of town halls in her state’s Republican districts as she readies a campaign for the open seat in Minnesota. All three are in more reliably Democratic states, but Pappas said being a lifelong Democrat does not mean he is at all satisfied with how the party got to where it is. “We have to recognize that in order to confront the damage that the administration is causing, in order to win elections and stop what the administration is doing right now, we need a coalition of folks that are able to step forward, run and win,” he told CNN. “The Democratic Party was flat-footed at the beginning of the Trump presidency. This is a moment where we need to be thinking about how to make a difference, using every tool we have to hold Republicans accountable and trying to establish some guardrails.” ‘I know it’s an uphill battle’ In Georgia, Sen. Jon Ossoff has started building his campaign around an approach he believes worked well for him in the past — talking common sense over chaos, railing against Trump’s authoritarian impulses and blasting corruption. When he spoke out against cuts to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was not to defend the diversity, equity and inclusion programs that Trump targeted, but to point to possible effects on public health. He’s also raised $11 million already and has had thousands at his rallies in a state that Trump won again last year, and some of what he’s built can be a model for others looking to flip seats in traditionally red states. Some prospects are emerging. In South Carolina, Annie Andrews — a pediatrician who lost a 2022 House race against Rep. Nancy Mace — has been having conversations about taking on Graham this time, convinced that the demographics in the state are shifting to make him vulnerable. In Alaska, Democrats are urging Mary Peltola — who flipped the statewide House seat in 2022 but lost it in 2024 despite running double digits ahead of the presidential ticket — to jump in against Dan Sullivan, hoping the state’s ranked-choice voting system could give her an edge. In Mississippi, District Attorney Scott Colom — whose nomination by Joe Biden to be a district court judge was blocked by Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith — has been gearing up for a likely run now against her.

      Vulnerable Senate Democrat Ossoff seeks to channel Trump outrage on tough road to reelection In Maine, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who worked at the Democratic group End Citizens United has told multiple people he will soon launch a campaign, but most eyes remain on Rep. Jared Golden, the four-term congressman whose most recent break with his party was being the sole House Democrat to vote for the GOP’s stopgap funding bill. He’s still weighing what to run, leaving Maine Democrats thinking of 77-year-old Gov. Janet Mills as their possible backup. In Nebraska, Dan Osborn — the local labor leader and industrial machinist who attracted significant Democratic interest and money for his 2024 Senate run as an independent — is nearing another run. Across the Missouri River, Nathan Sage last week launched a likeminded but still Democratic campaign against Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst. “This is shaping up to be an incredibly interesting election cycle where anything’s possible,” said South Carolina’s Andrews, who said she expects to make a final decision about running within weeks. “I know it’s an uphill battle — but the moment we find ourselves in, we have to run everywhere and do what we can to get this country back on track.” In Texas, after 2018 and 2024 races that fizzled despite national buzz, Democrats are trying to decide whether a GOP primary could get their hopes up for 2026. Within minutes of the race kicking off, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Sen. John Cornyn were attacking each other as unfit for office and failing to serve Texans. Former Rep. Colin Allred, the Democratic nominee last year, has been having conversations and attending events around the state as he seriously considers launching another campaign, and he expects to make a final decision by the summer. “I don’t care anymore about the DC game of proving to people that we can do this, or we can’t do that,” Allred told CNN. “This is a time of crisis — and that’s where I think it’s been where people are feeling that we need to do something.” Searching for candidates who can overcome how voters think about Democrats National Senate campaign operatives are in the early stages of deciding where they will focus, but they acknowledge that in most places, much of that will be candidate-driven, since winning will require overperforming in regards to how voters think about Democrats. In some cases, they say, that will mean pushing the most famous Democrat they can find to run, but in others it will be hunting for an unknown unicorn who can talk about shared values rather than partisanship. “Better candidates, stronger campaigns, a winning message, and a building midterm backlash against Republicans driven by their threats to Social Security and Medicaid are going to power Senate Democrats into the majority this cycle,” Gillibrand said in a statement provided to CNN. “Republicans have more seats to defend — and they’re doing it in a bad political environment.” Related article
      Democratic retirements create fresh challenge for hopes of winning back the Senate But for all the history of midterm elections tending to go against the party that controls the White House, the Democrats gearing up for these races know they’re going to need more than a bad political environment — even in Kentucky, the one race where a Republican incumbent isn’t running for another term, as former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell retires in a state that has a two-term Democratic governor but not much other recent history of supporting the party. “Somebody has to stand up, and I’ve done it my entire life,” said Pam Stevenson, an Air Force colonel and the minority leader of the state House who’s hoping to do better in her 2026 Senate campaign than in her 2023 race for attorney general. “It’s not too early. Especially if you’ve got to raise $25 million. It’s never too early to start giving people hope.” In Kansas, which also has a Democratic governor but hasn’t had a Democratic senator for decades, state party chair Jeanna Repass told CNN on Friday that while she’s already been part of several interviews with prospective opponents to Sen. Roger Marshall, she still is not sure who will run. But with new organizing already underway in rural parts of the state, Repass predicted there’s enough energy that there will even be a primary. “Being a Democrat in a red state, if you don’t lead with optimism,” she said, “you’re done from the get-go.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this incorrectly stated the bill for which Rep.

"Democrats are sounding the alarm over a cluster of recent polls showing that the party’s public image is more bruised and battered than at any point in decades. Those poor ratings from voters may signal long-term problems for the party if they persist through the 2028 presidential campaign. But the negative reviews probably won’t have nearly as much impact on the upcoming elections in 2025 and 2026 as many analysts in both parties are anticipating. Looking across recent midterm elections, there’s no evidence that such broad measures of party favorability have influenced the outcome in any consistent way. For instance, the Democrats’ image in most polls was at least as favorable as (and sometimes more favorable than) the Republicans’ in both 2010 and 2014 — and the GOP achieved historic landslides in those midterm elections anyway. The best evidence shows that attitudes toward the incumbent president are now exerting far more influence on midterm election results than views about the party out of the White House. What’s more, the historical record suggests the best way for the opposition party to raise its own standing is to weaken the president’s position. That means the Democrats’ best chance to recover before 2026 likely depends less on their efforts to refurbish their own image than on their ability to crystallize public discontent with the actions by President Donald Trump and the Republicans who control both chambers of Congress. “The Democratic party having the lowest negative rating in 30 years has consequence, but midterm elections are about the status of the economy, direction of the country, and presidential approval,” said longtime Republican pollster Bill McInturff. “Trump’s job approval before the election will tell us a lot more about the outcome of 2026 than the rating of the Democratic party.” The White House gave a clear sign last week that it agreed when Trump forced an obviously reluctant Elise Stefanik to withdraw her nomination as UN ambassador for fear of losing either her seat or one of the vacant Republican-held Florida seats during special elections this year. Needless to say, for all the teeth-gnashing among Democrats, the White House would not have taken such an unusual step if it believed the other party’s poor image rendered it unelectable in the months ahead. Democrats’ ‘deep hole’ For weeks, Democrats have been rattled by polls showing the party’s public image has hit its lowest point in decades. A recent NBC poll (conducted by McInturff’s firm, Public Opinion Strategies, and a Democratic partner) found just 27% of Americans viewed Democrats favorably, the lowest rating that poll has recorded for the party since 1990. The latest CNN/SRSS poll similarly found just 29% of adults holding a favorable view of the Democrats — also the lowest that survey (and earlier Gallup Polls) had found since 1992. One reason Democrats’ ratings have plummeted is that an unusually large share of the party’s own voters are unhappy with it — a reflection of the widespread frustration that the party’s national leadership has not formulated a more effective opposition to Trump. But the Democrats’ decline also reflects brutally low ratings among independents. These dismal readings have inevitably triggered end-is-near style warnings from many Democrats, particularly those who believe the party in recent years has tilted too far to the left. Democrats are “truly in a deep hole,” Ruy Teixeira, a longtime Democratic analyst who has become an unremitting critic of the party, wrote recently. “The party’s severe image, identification, governance, and geographic weaknesses cannot be remedied by mounting the (rhetorical) barricades against Trump and waiting for his administration to self-destruct.” Election trends in the Trump era indeed offer Democrats plenty of reason for concern about their long-term trajectory. The party has become uncompetitive in what many strategists consider an unsustainably large number of states, and the 2024 presidential results showed substantial movement toward Trump among non-White men and younger White men, as well as some erosion among Latina women. If those geographic and demographic trends harden, Democrats will face an increasingly difficult climb to piece together majorities in the Senate or the Electoral College. But history suggests the cries of imminent doom for Democrats significantly overstates the near-term risks the party faces from its weakened public image. In elections through this century, the public’s view of the party outside of the White House has not been nearly as strong a predictor of the results in the midterms as their assessment of the performance of the president and his party. Voter choices in the midterm are “more a reaction to the party in the White House,” said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. “How people feel about the out-party is probably not that important because if they are not happy with what is going on they are going to blame it on the president’s party and the president, and they are going to vote against them. That’s why the president’s party almost always loses seats.” Indeed, as I’ve written, no president has defended unified control of the White House and Congress through a midterm election since 1978 — the longest such stretch in US history. At times, the public’s general attitudes toward the two parties have seemed to presage the midterm results. The clearest example was in 2006, when substantially more Americans in Gallup polling expressed a favorable view of the Democratic Party (52%) than the GOP (37%) — a result that foreshadowed big Democratic gains in both chambers on Election Day. The relationship wasn’t quite as direct, but in 2022, the fact that voters were also mostly negative on Republicans (especially after the Supreme Court decision rescinding the constitutional right to abortion) helped Democrats to contain their losses in House elections and gain ground in the Senate, despite the pervasive discontent with President Joe Biden’s job performance. The president’s image matters more But more often in midterm elections, the relative favorability of the two parties has not been a reliable indicator of the outcome. In 2018, for instance, Republicans were viewed favorably by almost exactly as many voters as Democrats in polling by Gallup and NBC that fall, and by only slightly fewer voters than Democrats in CNN’s survey closest to election day. Yet the GOP lost 41 House seats in the election. In 2014, the Democrats’ public image was considerably more positive than the Republicans’ in polling that fall from Gallup and what was then the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. But in the election, Democrats lost 13 seats in the House and a crushing nine in the Senate. The most dramatic divergence came in 2010. The Gallup and CNN polls that fall showed that the share of voters viewing each party favorably and unfavorably was almost identical; the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll actually put Democrats in a slightly stronger position. Yet on Election Day, Republicans gained six seats in the Senate and 63 in the House — the biggest mid-term gain for either party since 1938. The common thread in these consecutive midterm routs was widespread discontent with the president. In Gallup polling, the approval rating for President Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014, and for Trump in 2018, all stood at just 42% to 45%, with most Americans disapproving of their performance. To many analysts, those judgments about the incumbent president have become the crucial factor in shaping midterm elections. In exit polls, 85% to 90% of voters who disapprove of the president’s performance now routinely vote against his party’s candidates in House elections, with a comparable share of voters who approve backing his party. Many strategists believe there’s little reason to expect that will change much in 2026, especially with Trump pursuing such a polarizing conservative agenda. “We are heading into a midterm where Republicans are very much the incumbent party, and if people aren’t happy with what they are doing, and how the country is doing, I think that will matter more than almost anything else,” said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with McInturff’s. The Democrats’ path back If anything, recent elections strongly suggest that the fastest way for Democrats to rebuild their image is to coalesce public concern about Trump. At other recent points when either party has faced broad public disapproval, it has tended to recover less because of any dramatic changes it made than because voters soured on the other side. In the normal hydraulics of a two-party system, when one party falls, the other tends to rise. Republicans, for instance, enjoyed a significant advantage in Gallup over Democrats in party image immediately after President George W. Bush’s reelection in 2004. But amid discontent over the Iraq War and Bush’s attempt to restructure Social Security, Democrats moved to their substantial lead by the fall of 2006. Democrats likewise held a big lead in favorability immediately after Obama’s victory in 2008. But amid frustration over the slow recovery from the financial crash of 2008, the bitter controversy over passage of the Affordable Care Act, and a steady decline in Obama’s approval numbers, the parties moved to parity in Gallup polling by fall 2010 (though also with more Americans negative than positive on each). Republicans likewise faced a big deficit after Trump left office in 2021, but moved slightly ahead in favorability by 2022 amid the discontent with Biden (albeit with substantially more voters again negative than positive about each side). In each case, the primary means that the party out of power used to redefine itself was opposition to the president’s agenda. In 2010, Mitch McConnell, then the GOP Senate leader, famously said that the party’s highest goal was to make Obama a one-term president. Ken Spain, who served as communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2010, said discontent with Obama opened the door for voters to reconsider Republicans. “Republican favorability had cratered in 2008” as Bush’s second term ended, Spain said. But “in the eyes of voters, Democrats took their eye off the ball — the economy. Within two years, Republican favorability had continued to inch upward, and by the time of the 2010 midterms, the party was once again viewed as a viable alternative.” Dan Sena, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during 2018, described virtually the same dynamic during Trump’s first term. In the DCCC’s private polling, “Going into January of ’17, on every major issue you could think of we were losing to Trump,” Sena said. “Then by August, we had turned them all around.” Democrats improved their standing, he argued, initially by pushing back against Trump initiatives that proved unpopular with voters, particularly the tax cuts tilted to the affluent, and the GOP’s unsuccessful attempt to repeal the ACA. “It is important to remember there’s an arc to this, and it takes about six months historically for the resistance to take hold,” Sena said. A weak public image is hardly without cost for Democrats. Party strategists worry that the low numbers among their own partisans could affect fundraising and the availability of volunteers. Discontent with Democrats likely would not prevent the party from gaining House seats in 2026 if most voters are negative on Trump, but it might reduce those gains, as the GOP’s negative image did in 2022. And if these dismal assessments of the Democrats persist, they would likely represent a greater threat in the 2028 presidential race: The party viewed more favorably in Gallup polling has won every presidential race since 1996, except in 2016. But, as Abramowitz noted, the party images in 2028 likely will be shaped less by today’s sparring than by the public’s reaction to their eventual presidential nominees (which may be why party favorability appears to better predict presidential election than midterm results). In the meantime, he believes there’s little chance even Democratic voters frustrated with their leaders will sit out 2026 given their disgust at Trump’s presidency. “Democrats might not be happy with their party, but they still despise Trump,” Abramowitz said. Fighting more forcefully against Trump won’t resolve all the Democrats’ problems with voters. But fanning more doubts about the president may be the party’s indispensable first step toward its own recovery.",,0.3085598051548004
"Vice President JD Vance applauded in the front row of the Rose Garden as President Donald Trump announced a massive new round of tariffs on Wednesday – an economy-rattling policy he promised would bring back manufacturing jobs. But for years before joining Trump’s ticket, Vance argued the opposite. Between 2016 and 2019, Vance said repeatedly that American manufacturing jobs were lost for good, and that “protectionist” trade policies would do little to bring them back. Vance’s comments are another example of his transformation from a self-described “Never Trump guy” to a full-fledged MAGA backer in the Senate and on Trump’s ticket, a change he has attributed to seeing the successes of Trump’s policies in his first term. “Vice President Vance has been crystal clear in his unwavering support for revitalizing the American economy by bringing back manufacturing jobs and sticking up for middle class workers and families since before he launched his U.S. Senate race, and that is a large part of why he was elected to public office in the first place,” said Taylor Van Kirk, spokesperson for the vice president. Vance is now a key messenger for Trump’s economic agenda as the administration pursues sweeping new protectionists policies announced on what they deemed “Liberation Day.” “It’s our declaration of economic independence,” Trump said Wednesday. “Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already.” Starting around 2016, when Vance rose to national fame as the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” he argued in repeated interviews, speeches and social media posts that automation and technological change were the primary forces reshaping the American economy and said he opposed “hyper protectionists” and their policies. “So many of these jobs that have disappeared from these areas just aren’t coming back. They haven’t disappeared so much from globalization or from shipping them overseas,” Vance said in a January 2017 interview with Education Week. “They’ve largely disappeared because of automation and because of new technological change.” Other comments and social media activity from Vance during that time directly took aim at Trump’s trade rhetoric. Shortly after Trump met with manufacturing CEOs in February 2017 and publicly railed against America’s trade deficits, Vance pushed back. “Can’t be repeated enough: if you’re worried about America’s economic interest, focus more on automation/education than trade protectionism,” Vance wrote. In December 2016, as then-President-elect Trump visited a Carrier plant in Indiana to tout a deal he claimed would keep manufacturing jobs from moving to Mexico, Vance liked a tweet from Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse that offered a different explanation for job loss. “Automation—even more than trade—will continue to shrink the number of manufacturing jobs,” Sasse wrote. “This trend is irreversible.” The like, which CNN saved before X made likes private last year, underscored Vance’s alignment at the time with Republicans who doubted the effectiveness of Trump’s proposals to restore blue-collar jobs through trade pressure alone. Even when Vance acknowledged that globalization had caused deep harm in some communities, citing research that linked increased exposure to Chinese imports with strain on local labor markets, he argued that those downsides did not justify a sweeping reversal of US trade policy. “Now does that mean that we should be hyper-protectionists in our approach to trade? I would argue no,” Vance said  at an April 2017 event. “But should we be cognizant of the fact that when you have some of those communities that are really exposed to trade, it can very often harm them or at least cause some pretty negative consequences, even as it might cause some positive ones. I think we have to.” “I do think that trade hasn’t necessarily been in the best interests of a lot of these communities. Now, the question of whether you can go backwards in time, I think the answer is no,” he told a gathering at the University of Chicago in February 2017. The long-term solution, Vance argued in December 2016, was to retrain workers. “The fundamental issue with American jobs and manufacturing right now is not that all of our jobs have gone to Mexico and China, it’s that they’ve been auto–automated. It’s that mechanization has sort of reduced the manufacturing work base,” he said. “There is a solution to that problem. It’s to train people for the next level of jobs, to train people for the 21st century workforce.” Vance also expressed skepticism about Trump’s promises to revive traditional industries through trade policy, specifically questioning whether legacy jobs like coal and steel could ever return. “I don’t think that there’s a simple, ‘Let’s bring the coal or steel jobs back,’” Vance said in early 2017. “But I also think that if folks are employed in next generation jobs with dignified work and good wages, that they’re not gonna be angry that Trump didn’t bring back the steel jobs.” While recognizing the downsides of globalization, Vance also argued it was too late to reverse course while agreeing at the time that fighting over trade was “yesterday’s war.” “Maybe you could [turn the clock back] a little bit on trade if we were in the ’80s, but we’ve already lost that battle in some ways,” Vance told CNN in February 2017. “The jobs are already gone.” More recently, Vance has credited Trump’s first term in the White House with broadly shifting his view on his agenda. And Vance’s public statements on globalization were beginning to shift by 2019, just before he has said he fully embraced Trump, voting for him in 2020 and then running the next year for Senate as a Trump-allied Republican. In October 2019, Vance called the view that automation had taken jobs a “bad argument.” “I’m not an economist, but I can spot a bad argument. And the argument–reproduced ad nauseum in the business press–that manufacturing jobs not keeping pace with output = automation is the main culprit is really bad,” he wrote. But even in the final half of Trump’s first term, when Vance was more sympathetic to the Trump administration’s arguments on trade, he was not optimistic on the odds of success of protectionist policies. “FWIW, my guess is the policy may very well fail, especially if Biden is elected president and China’s intransigence is rewarded. I’ve seen some claim that they’re explicitly betting on that fact,” he wrote.",,0.3014340400695801
"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Donald Trump’s White House has a threatening message for anyone who might even be perceived to disagree with the president: Don’t. Or else. Even though he has promised to end what he viewed as “weaponization” of the Department of Justice, Trump is treating people who disagree with him more like the “enemy from within” he talked about during the presidential campaign. The president took the unusual step this week of issuing official proclamations ordering the federal investigations of people who worked in his first administration. He’s demanding free work from law firms who represented his perceived enemies, threatening to impeach judges, deporting campus protesters and so much more. The underlying message, for anyone who hasn’t put all these things together, is that dissent will not be tolerated under Trump 2.0. To official who said 2020 was a secure election: You’re under investigation Chris Krebs oversaw the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, during Trump’s first term and affirmed the election Trump lost was free of fraud or tampering. That’s exactly why Trump wants him investigated. As Trump puts it in the proclamation, Krebs “falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen.” There is still zero compelling evidence the 2020 election was rigged or stolen, but the effect on Krebs’ cybersecurity business could be real. And the message to anyone currently working to secure American elections is unmistakable: There will be consequences for crossing the president, even when the president is alleging election fraud that does not exist. To the face of first-term ‘resistance’: You’re guilty of treason The other individual Trump targeted with a proclamation is Miles Taylor, the former Homeland Security official who wrote, first anonymously, during Trump’s first term that there was a “resistance” among government officials working to mute the president’s impact. Read CNN’s full report. Trump did not cite any specific law either man might have broken, but he did say in the Oval Office he thinks Taylor is guilty of treason. “He’s using every public and private means to try to attack these people, humiliate these people, get them to come and kiss the ring,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jamie Raskin in a video posted to social media. Trump is taking no chances with a resistance effort during his second term. His layoffs of federal workers, gutting of entire agencies and punitive firings should be message enough. Key officials, notably, have resigned in key moments rather than follow directives they disagreed with. To law firms that opposed Trump: Pony up In the Oval Office, as he signed those proclamations targeting Krebs and Taylor, Trump bragged that law firms who represented his opponents are now lining up to do free work on his behalf after he threatened them with retribution in executive orders. His aide Stephen Miller said firms have agreed to nearly $700 million in free work for Trump to avoid punitive proclamations. Some law firms, notably Jenner & Block, sued over Trump’s efforts to punish them. A judge said the orders were likely unconstitutional, but many other firms are bending the knee and agreeing to do free work on Trump’s behalf instead. There are multiple other examples of Trump using the weight of the government to target people and places he opposes. To cities that don’t want to comply with ICE moves: Federal offices will be closed Small Business Administration Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced the closure of multiple offices in cities “that do not comply” with ICE efforts and relocate them elsewhere. The targeted cities are Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, New York City and Seattle. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy did not mention immigration policy when he announced in a New York Post Op-Ed that HHS would close half of its 10 regional offices. But the targeted offices are a similar list: Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle. Atlanta will keep its regional HHS office, along with Kansas City, Dallas, Denver and Philadelphia. To universities struggling to balance free speech: Research grants are frozen Cornell and Northwestern joined a growing list of elite research universities that have had hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in research grants frozen. The administration has demanded that schools end diversity programs and has criticized student protests against the war in Gaza. Read more. To lawful immigrants and students who led campus protests: We’ll deport you CNN has identified hundreds of students whose visas have been revoked, but the most notable example of a protester targeted for deportation is Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who has been detained in Louisiana for more than a month. A Louisiana immigration judge ruled Friday that Khalil can be deported, although that likely won’t happen immediately since there is also an ongoing case in New Jersey. Khalil was arrested in New York, not Louisiana, and CNN has reported that immigrant rights advocates fear the administration is effectively shopping for judges by moving detainees like Khalil from the Northeast to the South. To judges who might rule against the administration: We’ll move to impeach you Republicans in the House do not appear to have the votes, but Trump and Musk have publicly called for judges who issue rulings they disagree with to be impeached. Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare rebuke of that language. The House did have the votes this week to pass a bill aimed at restricting district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions against Trump’s policies, but it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. To the DOJ lawyer who admitted a man was deported in error: You’re suspended The Supreme Court said this week that Trump’s administration must facilitate the return of a Maryland father who a Department of Justice lawyer admitted in court was mistakenly deported. The lawyer who made the admission has been suspended, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi. “He shouldn’t have argued it, if that’s what he was going to do,” she said on Fox News. All of this will have an effect across the country as people who disagree with Trump struggle to figure out how to register their opposition. CNN’s Michael Williams went to a protest supporting immigrants in Dallas and heard one organizer say that people who take part need to be prepared to be deported. “As organizers who feel compelled to protest in this day, we have to accept we may be subject to removal,” Jaclyn McJunkin, an immigration-rights organizer and activist, told the group of about 50 people, according to Williams’ report. “It’s just something that you have to embrace, OK? Because if you don’t, then they win, right?”",,0.20893152058124542
"Ed Martin, the Trump administration’s nominee to serve as US attorney for Washington, DC, failed to report hundreds of media appearances he’s made in the past few years, including many on far-right outlets and Russian-state media, when he first filed his mandated disclosure forms to Congress, a CNN review found. Martin, a longtime conservative activist and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, has filled the role in an acting capacity since January. He’s drawn attention for a number of controversial moves during his tenure, including referring to the nation’s largest office of federal prosecutors as “President Trumps’ [sic] lawyers,” and demoting senior attorneys who worked on January 6, 2021, Capitol riot cases. After Trump formally nominated him for the permanent job in March, Martin submitted mandatory paperwork to the Senate, including what is supposed to be a detailed account of all his past media appearances. But a CNN KFile analysis of Martin’s initial 27-page disclosure form reveals that it does not come close to capturing the extent of his media appearances, and it lacks any reference to at least 240 podcast, radio and TV interviews he’s done in the past two years alone . Martin has subsequently updated his disclosures twice this month, including filing a 12-page supplemental form dated April 15 that listed dozens more media appearances. Still, overall, his disclosures fail to capture the vast majority of his media appearances over the years. CNN tallied 198 appearances Martin failed to disclose between 2023 and 2024, including ones in which he suggested that, as US attorney for DC, he would prosecute family members of former President Joe Biden and criminally charge people involved in federal investigations into Trump. Martin noted in his initial disclosure form in March that there “may be other materials I have been unable to identify, find or remember.” Just as he did in his April 7 disclosure update, Martin wrote in Tuesday’s submission, “I regret the errors and apologize for any inconvenience.” While it’s not unusual for nominees from either party to omit some media appearances and later amend their disclosure forms, Martin’s omissions in some cases appear to be glaring. He initially listed zero media appearances in 2023, for instance, but according to a CNN tally, he made at least 124 separate appearances across podcasts, radio shows and television that year. Martin’s updated form includes 19 appearances from 2023, leaving at least 105 appearances  still unaccounted for. Even the updates Martin submitted on Tuesday were incomplete. Most of the web links he provided do not work. And on multiple occasions, Martin failed to capture all of his appearances on a given day. For example, he added one interview with Sputnik on December 13, 2023, but failed to include three other podcast appearances CNN found from that day. Martin’s podcast suddenly unavailable While Martin disclosed his podcast, “The Pro America Report with Ed Martin,” in his paperwork, the episodes are unavailable to listen to across most major podcasting platforms. At some point, within the five days before Martin submitted his paperwork to the Senate Judiciary Committee in late March, all episodes of his podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify were unavailable, according to a source involved in the committee review process. CNN, however, saved those podcast episodes earlier this year. Martin amended some of his disclosure paperwork in the early April letter sent to the committee and pushed back on committee Democrats who publicly accused him of removing “nearly 1,000 hours” of podcasts from online platforms such as Spotify and Apple Podcasts. “I want to make clear that I have never deleted or removed my podcasts,” Martin wrote in a letter to the panel reviewed by CNN. “After review, it appears those platforms are aggregating my podcasts, possibly for UX or storage purposes.” Martin pointed to segments of his podcast on SoundCloud, which he did not include in his paperwork but are available to listen to, and he claimed   that “online platforms appear to be reconfiguring podcast titles and segments unbeknownst to me.” A Spotify spokesperson told CNN it did not remove the show from its platform. CNN reached out to Apple for comment but did not receive a response. The undisclosed appearances mostly include Martin’s comments on far-right outlets as well as at least 27 appearances on Russian-state podcasts in 2023 and 2024. On Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that Martin appeared on Russian state media more than 150 times between 2016 and 2024. A Martin spokesperson told the Post, “Mr. Martin has disclosed all of the [Washington Post] identified links in a supplemental letter to the Senate.” “This is routine activity in preparation for confirmation,” said the spokesperson and referred questions to the White House.

      Ex-January 6 prosecutors urge attorney disciplinary board to investigate Trump’s controversial pick to be DC’s top prosecutor In response to a detailed list of questions, Martin’s office referred CNN to the White House, which did not respond. One former Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee staffer who worked on confirming Democratic and Republican nominees during the Clinton and Bush administrations said a scenario where an individual did not disclose multiple speeches or appearances would be a “huge concern” and “super problematic.” “There would be criticism of the Justice Department for failing to properly vet the nominee and make sure that it was disclosed,” said the former staffer, who didn’t want to be identified for fear of retaliation by Martin. “But the predominant consequence in a normal political environment would be that the person might not be confirmed because they hid information or failed to disclose relevant information.” Tight timeline for nomination The clock is ticking on Martin’s nomination, which the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, has not moved forward. Martin’s status as acting US attorney expires  on May 20, according to federal law. With the Senate scheduled to be out of town for the next two weeks, the timeline could get tight on bringing his nomination to a floor vote. Congressional Democrats have sought probes into Martin’s prosecutorial conduct. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff earlier this month placed a hold on Martin’s nomination because of Martin’s rhetoric and conduct, which delays Republicans from moving forward and complicates the process. And Democrats have even taken the rare step of requesting a confirmation hearing. While Martin is known for attacking Democrats, he has also gone after Republican lawmakers, and some are starting to raise concerns. Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, whom Martin once derided as “soft” for supporting a bipartisan gun safety bill,  told CNN last week that Martin was “controversial” and said he is pushing for the panel to hold a hearing. “I always think hearings are helpful,” said Cornyn, who added the idea of holding a hearing on Martin is being discussed among Senate Judiciary Republicans. But in a statement to CNN, Grassley spokeswoman Clare Slattery indicated that the senator does not intend to hold hearings on Martin’s nomination. “The Senate Judiciary Committee hasn’t held a hearing for a US Attorney nominee in more than 40 years, and not once in the time Grassley has chaired or been ranking on the committee. Chairman Grassley intends to maintain this precedent,” the statement said.  “The committee expects nominees to fully disclose all required materials as part of the standard nominations process, and Martin continues to make disclosures as part of that process.” In other past comments, Martin referred to Utah Sen. John Curtis as a “supposed Republican” and “traitor” for voting to extend the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. He said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski “pretends to represent conservatives” and deserved to be primaried, and he praised the   potential censure of Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins because she voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. Martin also said Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell was part of a “swamp fix” who became rich from their work in government. This month, five former prosecutors who worked on January 6, 2021, cases sent a letter urging the DC bar’s legal disciplinary office to investigate Martin for his conduct, citing Martin’s public statements in which he suggested investigating “perceived political enemies of himself and the President.” History of socially conservative positions Martin has a history of staking out hardline, socially conservative positions, including publicly advocating for a national abortion ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He’s even raised the idea of  imposing criminal penalties on women and doctors involved in abortions, as CNN’s KFile has previously reported. Prior to heading one of the nation’s most powerful US attorney’s offices, Martin had no prosecutorial experience. He has served as a defense attorney for a handful of January 6 rioters. During his four months as acting US attorney for Washington, DC, Martin has displayed his loyalty to Trump : He ordered a series of firings, demotions and reassignments of prosecutors working January 6 cases. He launched his own probes into Capitol riot prosecutions and the legality of Biden’s twilight pardons, and he publicly promised Elon Musk that his office would investigate people threatening Musk and his government workers and “chase them to the end of the Earth to hold them accountable.” The New York Times reported earlier this month that Martin’s office is pursuing an inquiry into Biden’s pardons of his family members. Martin previously worked as the president of Phyllis Schlafly Eagles – a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late anti-feminist activist. He was a leader in the “Stop the Steal” movement that falsely claimed Trump won the 2020 presidential election. In comments from a December 2024 radio interview that Martin failed to disclose, Martin criticized Biden for pardoning his son Hunter Biden. “If I was the US attorney in Washington, DC, on January 21, I would impanel a grand jury. And I would call Hunter Biden before the grand jury, who has to go without a lawyer, and he has to answer questions because now he has immunity from prosecution. So the protection under the Constitution of not incriminating yourself goes away if you’re immune,” said Martin on “The Stevie Jay Morning Show.” Related article
      Hardline activist who raised the idea of jailing women for abortions gets top policy job in Trump administration “If he doesn’t answer the questions or he lies, he goes to jail because that’s a new crime. It’s not covered by Biden as the pardon,” said Martin, adding that he would like to look at other Biden family members who received pardons, naming the former president’s brother James. A week after the podcast episode aired, Martin was tapped to be the next chief of staff at the Office of Management and Budget. But by January 20, Trump appointed him as the interim US attorney for Washington, DC. And in previously unreported   comments Martin made on his podcast in August 2023, Martin said that the people involved in federal investigations into Trump should face criminal investigations and be “charged under RICO,” which refers to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, most famously used to prosecute organized crime in the 1970s and 1980s. Martin has also repeated January 6 conspiracy theories that “Antifa” was possibly behind the violence and about the pipe bombs found near the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters that day, insisting that “something stinks. Something stinks to high heaven.” Martin said in a March 2024 episode of his podcast that “if the FBI really can’t find out what happened,” it’s because “either the FBI is corrupt, which I’m not willing to say yet, or someone bigger than the FBI has made it.” He then baselessly speculated whether the military was   involved in planting the pipe bombs. “I remember someone told me afterwards that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the head of the military, has a lot of special ops things going on. I don’t know if that’s true. I’m just saying something bigger than the FBI is needed to hide this. Because the FBI has the tools to find something like this,” Martin said.

"President Donald Trump tried again Tuesday to rewrite the history of US relations with South Korea. Trump has repeatedly delivered false assertions about the payments South Korea has made for decades to help cover the cost of the major US military presence in the country (more than 26,000 personnel as of the end of 2024). On Tuesday, he wrote on social media that he had just spoken with South Korean acting President Han Duck-soo about economic issues and about “payment for the big time Military Protection we provide to South Korea.” Trump then added this: “They began these Military payments during my first term, Billions of Dollars, but Sleepy Joe Biden, for reasons unknown, terminated the deal. That was a shocker to all!” Trump’s claim is false in two big ways. First, South Korea’s payments did not begin during Trump’s first term. The cost-sharing deals known as Special Measures Agreements began in 1991, more than 25 years before Trump took office in 2017. Second, former President Joe Biden did not terminate a Trump cost-sharing agreement with South Korea. The only Special Measures Agreement signed by the Trump administration had expired by the time Biden took office in 2021 – and Biden’s administration then signed two such agreements, one in 2021 and one in 2024, that both included South Korean spending increases. “There was no deal that was ‘terminated,’” Andrew Yeo, a politics professor and Korea expert at The Catholic University of America and The Brookings Institution think tank, said in a Tuesday email. “Trump’s characterization of Biden’s deal with South Korea is inaccurate,” Yonho Kim, an international affairs professor and associate director of the Institute for Korean Studies at The George Washington University, said in a Tuesday email. South Korea increased its payments in both of its cost-sharing deals with Biden Here’s the truth about what happened under Trump and Biden. Trump inherited a South Korea cost-sharing deal negotiated by the Obama administration, which ran from 2014 through 2018. Trump then agreed to a one-year deal for 2019, which secured an 8.2% increase in the South Korean contribution. That one-year Trump deal was the 10th in the series of Special Measures Agreements that started in 1991, so “it wasn’t as if South Korea began its VERY FIRST cost-sharing payments in 2019,” Jiun Bang, a Colorado College international relations professor, said in a Tuesday email. And Trump was unable to get South Korea to agree to the standard multi-year agreement; South Korea rejected his demands for a giant spending increase in the vicinity of 400%, from less than $1 billion per year to $5 billion per year or close. South Korea did come to a smaller deal with the Trump administration in mid-2020 to spend $200 million that year to pay the South Korean employees of US forces, who had been put on leave because Trump’s one-year Special Measures Agreement had lapsed at the end of 2019. But negotiations on a new Special Measures Agreement were still unresolved when Trump left the White House in January 2021. The Biden administration completed the talks in March 2021, agreeing to an 11th Special Measures Agreement to retroactively cover 2020 and continue through 2025. Then, with the possibility of a second Trump term looming, the Biden administration and South Korea signed a 12th agreement in late 2024, to run from 2026 through 2030. Trump claimed during his 2024 presidential campaign that Biden had allowed South Korea’s payments to go “way, way down” to “almost nothing,” but that’s not true, either. South Korea agreed to substantial spending hikes in both of its Biden-era deals. The agreement signed in 2021 included a 2021 increase of 13.9% – meaning South Korea’s payment that year would be about $1 billion – and then additional increases in 2022 through 2025 tied to increases in South Korea’s defense budget. The agreement signed in 2024 is scheduled to begin with an 8.3% increase in 2026 and then additional increases tied to South Korean inflation. Trump baselessly claimed in October 2024, as a presidential candidate, that “if I were there now, they’d be paying us $10 billion a year. And you know what? They’d be happy to do it.”",,0.2682549059391022
"President Donald Trump made a series of false claims in televised remarks Thursday at a meeting of his Cabinet, including inaccurate assertions about US relations with China, Japan and the European Union. Here is a fact check of some of his remarks, most of which CNN has debunked before. The US trade deficit with China: Trump repeated his false claim that “China has a surplus of $1 trillion” with the US on trade. That is not close to accurate. In fact, official federal statistics show the US trade deficit with China in goods and services trade was about $263 billion in 2024. Even if you exclude the services trade, at which the US excels, and count only trade in goods, the 2024 deficit with China was about $295 billion. The US has never approached a $1 trillion trade deficit with China. The deficit in goods trade alone hit a record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years. Who pays Trump’s tariffs on China: Trump repeated his frequent false claim that because of the tariffs he imposed during his first term, China paid the US hundreds of billions of dollars. In fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China, make the tariff payments to the US government, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on China. It’s easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers. The US military presence in Japan: Trump falsely claimed that the US has a deal with Japan in which the US defends Japan, spending “hundreds of billions of dollars” for that purpose, but “we pay all the money; they don’t pay anything.” In fact, Japan provides billions of dollars per year in support for the US military presence in the country. The federal Government Accountability Office wrote in a 2021 report that data obtained from the US Defense Department showed that from 2016 through 2019, Japan provided $12.6 billion “in cash payments and in-kind financial support” for the US military presence – and also provided “indirect support, such as forgone rents on land and facilities used by U.S. forces, as well as waived taxes.” Over the same period, the report said, the US Defense Department obligated $20.9 billion for the US military presence in Japan. The formation of the European Union: Trump repeated his false claim that the European Union was “formed for the purpose of taking advantage of the United States.” Experts on the European Union have told CNN that there is no basis for such claims, noting that US presidents consistently supported European integration efforts. “The President’s claims are preposterous,” Desmond Dinan, a public policy professor at George Mason University and another expert in the history of European integration, said during Trump’s first presidency. “The European Communities (forerunner of the EU) were formed in the 1950s as part of a joint US-Western European plan to stabilize and secure Western Europe and promote prosperity, by means of trade liberalization and economic growth, throughout the shared transatlantic space.” John O’Brennan, professor of European politics at Maynooth University in Ireland, said in an interview this week that Trump’s assertion “could not be more wrong or inaccurate,” adding that it is “bizarrely at odds with the history” – in which the US provided critical support for European integration after the continent was ravaged by World War II, then continued to be supportive in the following decades. Inflation during Trump’s first term: Trump repeated his false claim that “I went four years without inflation,” qualifying the claim moments later by saying “we had no inflation, essentially.” He gave himself some wiggle room with the word “essentially,” but there was indeed some inflation during his first four years in office; prices rose about 8% from the beginning of that presidency to the end. Year-over-year inflation was 1.4% in the month he left office, January 2021, during the Covid-19 pandemic. Migration, prisons and mental institutions: Trump repeated his familiar claim about how foreign leaders – in countries “all over the world” – supposedly emptied their jails, “mental institutions” and “insane asylums” to somehow “dump” people from those facilities into the US as migrants during Joe Biden’s presidency. There is no evidence for Trump’s claim, which Trump’s own 2024 presidential campaign was unable to corroborate. (The campaign was unable to provide any evidence even for his narrower claim that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US.) Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population plummeted under Biden. But that’s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom. “I do a daily news search to see what’s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” Helen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June 2024, when Trump made a similar claim. The border wall:  Trump repeated his false claim that he had “571 miles of border wall” built on the southern border “in the first administration.” That’s a significant exaggeration; official government data shows 458 miles were built during Trump’s first term — including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers.",,0.2652648389339447
"Karim Walji is certain he is about to lose business. Worried he may have to shrink his workforce — fire people — for the first time in eight years. He blames President Donald Trump and what Walji sees as a reckless power trip. “He wants the US to flex their muscle,” said Walji, a partner in AI Industries, a steel fabricating plant in western Canada. “He wants to show that the US is strong and, ‘Because I am bigger than you are, I can bully you around, and this is how I am going to do it.’” Last week, AI Industries was a shining example of one of the world’s most remarkable and lucrative trade relationships; US-Canada trade totals just shy of $800 billion annually. This week, it is one piece of a confusing trade confrontation that keeps shifting from war to detente. Trump on Tuesday slapped a new 25% tariff on almost all goods coming from Canada and Mexico. Then on Thursday, Trump suspended some tariffs for nearly one month, his latest about face. Walji prefers no tariffs, of course. But he says Trump’s constant threats and reversals have made planning impossible and are already driving up costs and hurting both nations’ economies. “Even with the threat of tariffs, prices and material prices have gone through the roof and gone higher,” Walji said. “We’re seeing right now when we are bidding a job today versus bidding it three months ago, our cost has gone up almost 15 percent.” The British Columbia visit was the first international foray for our All Over The Map project, which is shifting from its initial focus on the 2024 campaign to the impact of the new administration’s policy agenda. We visited a few days before the Trump tariffs were scheduled to take effect, and the AI Industries plant was humming. Giant steel beams on one belt were moved into position for custom cuts and drill holes. On another, a worker welded angled braces. In the yard, beams were tagged and stacked neatly: American steel, shipped across the border by rail for custom fabrication. Some of it for a new high-rise in Vancouver. Some of it soon to be shipped back across the border for an office project in Alaska. Canada has said its retaliatory tariffs would stay in place until Trump made the pause permanent. American companies will suffer too, Walji said. Specialty steel fabrication requires enormous, expensive machines. “Made in the USA” is on almost all of the big cutters and drillers at AI Industries. The machines range in price from $400,000 to nearly $1 million, and Walji said several are due to be replaced. But with Canada’s retaliatory tariffs in place, he said he would purchase new machines from Europe — not from the Illinois company that has been his supplier for years. It is not just that Canadians believe Trump is practicing bad economics — bad math. They are also offended by his bad manners; constant references to Canada as the 51st state and its prime minister as “governor.” “I find it very insulting,” Walji said. “It’s disrespectful.” British Columbia is a living postcard, with scenic mountains and farmlands and gorgeous waterways. The importance of trade is just about everywhere you look. Canadian lumber stacked and wrapped at river’s edge waiting to be shipped. Rail yards filled with cars carrying Canadian crude oil and farm products and more. Truck after truck heading to and from the docks and rail yards. “If you watch for eight hours, you’ll see on average we’ve got 10 ships arriving and 10 ships leaving,” said Peter Xotta, the CEO of the Port of Vancouver. “We did about 160 million tons of cargo last year. Seventy-five percent of that is those bulk commodities. Grain, coal, potash, sulfur and other agricultural products.” Xotta said a protracted trade war would be devastating. “The economic activity here is very dependent on north-south trade,” he said. But he also said Trump’s tariffs and tone had Canada rethinking things. “It’s been a wakeup call for Canadians that we need to figure out a way to be not as dependent,” he said. Vikram Vinayak likens it to a bad dream. Vinayak is a father of two, an immigrant who came to Canada in 2019 to be with his wife and start a family. He loves his job as short haul truck driver, but says he has no choice but to look for a new one. Right now, he has as many as five runs a day and works 40 to 50 hours a week. But between 80 percent and 90 percent of his shipments are headed to the United States. With any new US tariffs, “the number of loads will decrease, and my hours will also decrease.” He sometimes heads to Seattle to shop, and the family took a Las Vegas vacation last year. But “nowadays because of the tariffs everything is getting intense. I can’t think of going anywhere.” Darryl Lamb is the brand manager at Legacy Liquor Store. Suddenly he’s in the crosshairs of a trade war. In addition to the Canadian government’s reciprocal tariffs, the premier of British Columbia is taking additional steps to show displeasure with Trump. The province is banning sales of American alcohol brands from states Trump won in 2024 that also have Republican governors. So Kentucky bourbon is exempt, because Gov. Andy Beshear is a Democrat. But Jack Daniels and other Tennessee whiskeys would be banned. Yellow Rose Bourbon is from Texas, as are Tito’s and Deep Eddy vodka. It is Lamb’s job now to get them off the shelves. “We’ve gone through this before with the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Lamb said. “We were asked to remove all Russian products from our shelves.” In the days before the tariffs were scheduled kicked in, Lamb said some customers raced to stockpile American favorites before they were banned. But other customers got testy with store employees, demanding that all American products be taken off the shelves because of Trump’s tariffs and insults. “There are a lot of people that are passionate,” Lamb said. “Canadians love their country, you know, and when you hear ‘governor’ and ‘51st state’ and all this stuff.” He urges angry customers to stay calm, or to write their member of parliament. But he understands their anger with Trump and his not-so-neighborly broadsides. “We’ve been together for a long time,” Lamb said. “We fought wars together. We went to Afghanistan. We did all this stuff together. Why? What are you doing here?” ﻿This story has been updated with additional details.",,0.30755260586738586
"Angela Lang is about to send her canvassing teams door knocking. But first, a moment to outline the stakes: “Fair maps, abortion, voting rights,” is Lang’s list. “It’s not a seat we can afford to lose because if Republicans and conservatives gain control of the court, that’s Elon Musk and that’s a through line to the Trump agenda.” On paper, the April 1 election pits Susan Crawford against Brad Schimel for a vacancy on the Wisconsin state Supreme Court. Liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley is retiring, and the election will determine the court’s ideological balance. Crawford currently serves as a Dane County Circuit Court judge and is a former prosecutor and legal counsel to a past Democratic governor. Schimel is a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge and was the state’s GOP attorney general from 2015 to 2019. The court race is a reminder that Wisconsin isn’t just a 50-50 state in presidential races. Close contests for Supreme Court seats have been common in recent years, and liberals are fighting in this one to maintain the 4-3 edge in the court they won in 2023.President Donald Trump’s weekend endorsement of Schimel only elevates the national stakes of the contest. They’re even bigger for Lang and organizations like Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, of which Lang is executive director. She preached a version of that “can’t afford to lose” argument five months ago, but Trump won Wisconsin on his way to a swing-state sweep and the White House. Now, with November’s bruises still tender, she faces another giant organizing and turnout challenge. “There’s always the finger-pointing after an election,” Lang said in an interview. “This would be the first true local test to see if there are lessons learned.” Trump increased his vote total and vote share in Milwaukee in November, including in the predominantly Black neighborhoods where BLOC operates. Lang’s way of doing things is among the points of post-election debate. Pro-Trump groups were nowhere near as visible or active as BLOC when it came to door knocking and community meetings. Yet Trump increased his share of the Black vote and, with help from Musk and others, used digital tools to reach and activate voters. In this Supreme Court election, Musk has funneled nearly $7 million to a conservative group in the state that is trying to mirror the 2024 strategy to mobilize voters for Trump. It includes digital targeting as well as traditional canvassing operations. A super PAC Musk has supported in the past is also spending heavily on television advertising. It is not required to disclose its donors. Lang hears the criticism that old-fashioned door-knocking isn’t as effective or necessary anymore. But she dismisses it as uninformed. “We will definitely increase some of our digital stuff,” Lang said. But, “I will always take stock in listening to our team that is knocking all day every day and has more of a pulse on the community than any overpaid consultant that likely is not even from our state and hasn’t set foot in our community.” We visited with Lang several times last year as part of our All Over the Map project tracking the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of Americans who live in key states and are part of crucial voting blocs. Lang was well aware, especially in the final weeks, that Trump was running stronger in her community, especially among Black men. “People didn’t feel the Democrats were addressing the needs and the issues of the average voter,” Lang said. “People wanted to try something different.” Now, despite the enormous stakes in the Supreme Court race, Lang and other progressives here told us turnout remains a giant worry. “There’s so much voter fatigue,” Lang said. “People don’t want to talk about politics right now. They feel completely checked out.” That voter fatigue is just one piece of a complicated challenge for Democrats. There are tensions between grassroots activists and consultants over what went wrong in 2024 and how to fix it, both on how to prioritize an issues list and how to then communicate it more effectively; over whether they can or should make Musk an election foil. There is also anger at Democratic leaders for not showing more fight – and having more success – as President Trump moves at a frenetic pace. “We need to hold our ground,” is how Democratic consultant Josh Klemons put it. “Then Senate Democrats cave and absolutely people are frustrated. There’s no question about it. … It’s very hard to keep asking people to give their everything when they don’t see real progress.” Klemons is trying, with frequent TikTok posts about the stakes of the court election. He is the first to admit that – at first glance, anyway – he might not look the part. “I’m not a camera guy,” Klemons said in an interview at his Madison home. “I didn’t grow up wanting to be a digital influencer.” But he posted a TikTok complaining about how Republicans drew Wisconsin legislative maps a couple of years ago. “And it blew up,” he said. “And I did another a few days later, and it blew up even harder.” Now, he posts one a day on average, some shot in his basement office, others on a woodsy trail near his home. “My whole message is that we are in this together,” he said. “No campaign is going to save us.” On our latest Wisconsin visit, we stopped by a Milwaukee Democrats monthly meeting where the discussion was mostly about the urgency of the court race. But one member offered a resolution urging the group to invest in new organizing offices in Black and Latino sections of the city where Trump improved his vote share in 2024. Klemons has no issue with more visibility and brick-and-mortar party offices. But he says Democrats and progressives need to think and act on a much grander scale. “Republicans have built a massive media infrastructure that allows them to get out their message in a way Democrats cannot compete with,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if our messages are better or not because they are not getting heard.” Klemons sees a 2024 replay in the final weeks of the Crawford-Schimel race: Musk pouring millions into advertising and turnout efforts. “Wisconsin has a real chance on April 1 to show money cannot buy elections,” he said in the interview – echoing one of his TikTok themes. “The world’s richest man cannot pick and choose who should serve in our government at every level.” Democrats are making Musk as much of an issue, if not even more of one, than Trump himself. “We live in Elon Musk’s world right now,” Klemons said. “I’m working very hard to make sure we don’t live in Elon Musk’s Wisconsin.” Kate Duffy, like Klemons, calls her path to Instagram accidental. She founded a group called Motherhood for Good back in 2022 and now posts regularly on issues she sees as essential to busy mothers like herself. “I try to make content that can be digested between bath and bedtime,” Duffy said in an interview at her home in suburban Milwaukee. “A quick video that somebody can watch in two or three minutes is going to do really well.” One Duffy staple is 60-second explainers of key issues and themes. She augments the posts with maps and graphics. But she is also now leaning into longer posts – for her, a key lesson of her 2024 experience trying to help Kamala Harris. “My biggest takeaway is to listen to my gut more,” Duffy said. “We can do a longer video. We can explain things more. We can add more nuance. People are craving that.” Messages from campaign consultants dissuaded her from doing more of that last year. “(I) kept hearing, well, ‘These are the messages. It needs to be quick and simple. And hit this.’ And looking back, I’m realizing that is probably what came off as inauthentic and didn’t really resonate with as many people.” Another takeaway: Talk more and smarter about the economy and the cost of living. “There’s so many women who make all the household purchasing decisions and are in charge of the budget and that is certainly somewhere where we can do better,” Duffy said. Democratic consultants, she said, urged a focus on abortion rights and women’s rights. “That’s foundational,” Duffy said. “I’m always going to believe in that. But we can’t discount somebody’s actual struggle they are feeling to put food on the table for their kids. That is a daily trauma they are dealing with. So I think we need to do a better job messaging towards the economy.” The barbershop was a daily town hall long before the internet, long before new media and social media and big data. Eric Jones stops by the Exodus Hair Studio in Milwaukee once a week for a trim and for crackling conversations about the Bucks and the Brewers, about the local economy and about everything under the sun when it comes to politics. Jones was part of our All Over the Map Project last year and repeatedly told us – in part because of the chatter at Exodus – that Trump was running stronger among Black men than he had in 2016 and 2020. He is, again, worried about Musk money late in a campaign. “Any political campaign is essentially an information war,” Jones said. “And any war needs a budget. The guy with the biggest budget tends to win.” And he is worried, again, about Black turnout. “I’ve asked a good amount of people,” Jones told us in an interview at Exodus. “It’s bad when you don’t know the candidates.” Jones was a reliable barometer of his community throughout 2024. Now, in the early days of the new Trump term, he has two takeaways. Jones hears some buyer’s remorse among Latino friends who shifted to Trump and now regret it because of the administration’s crackdown on the undocumented. “They are regretting it now – right now,” Jones said. “But his policies haven’t gotten to the Black community yet.” Many of Jones’ friends, for example, believe the federal government can be cut substantially and yawn when Trump critics complain about installing loyalists at the FBI and Department of Justice. “That doesn’t resonate with them,” Jones said. “Let him do something that affects their day-to-day.” So far, Jones said he sees little to nothing that convinces him Democrats have learned their 2024 lessons. That worries him some in the context of the Supreme Court election. “But it’s kind of unfair,” Jones is quick to add. “Because it just happened to them. I don’t know if anybody can learn a lesson that quickly.  … The midterms will be a better chance to see it.” This story has been updated with additional information.",,0.26855406165122986
"President Donald Trump is heading into another volatile week of his trade wars facing an urgent need to de-escalate the clash he ignited with China before it inflicts deep damage on the US economy. Chinese President Xi Jinping is so far declining US pressure to call his American counterpart to seek a “deal” after the United States imposed 145% tariffs on its superpower rival, setting off a long-feared direct confrontation. This leaves Trump repeatedly assuring Americans that his “great relationship” with the Chinese leader will head off a crisis but unable to initiate talks in a standoff that risks tanking stock markets again and imposing real hardships on Americans. Despite the uncertainty, Trump is putting on a show of relishing multiple fights he set off, and he lapped up a standing ovation as he took a seat cage-side at a UFC mixed martial arts event in Florida on Saturday night. The president, who styles himself as an ultimate political fighter, told reporters his reception was “somewhat legendary” and showed that “we’re doing a good job.” But the president’s conflict with China is a real-world showdown with far higher stakes.

      Trump official says tariff exemptions on tech are temporary. Elizabeth Warren calls trade war ‘red light, green light’ game The impasse is so serious because the US and Chinese economies are intricately entwined. The US relies on China for consumer electronics; rare earth minerals used in the manufacture of electric vehicles and for military applications and robotics; pharmaceuticals used in lifesaving medicines; and more basic staples of daily life, including clothing and shoes. US exports of produce like soybeans and sorghum to China are vital to the livelihoods of American farmers, but the tariffs imposed by both sides are so prohibitive that trade may effectively grind to a halt. Both sides could suffer terribly in a full-blown trade war, and US consumers could be hit by shortages and surging prices. But some experts believe that China, owing to its authoritarian system of government, would be willing to impose more pain on its populace to avoid losing what could be a defining struggle with the US. China imposed reciprocal 34% tariffs on all imports from the United States from April 10, including export controls on seven types of rare-earth minerals, such as samarium, gadolinium and terbium. Trump’s capacity to play the long game was called into question when he suddenly paused reciprocal tariffs on dozens of nations last week for 90 days after bond market sell-offs began to hint at a developing financial crisis. That climbdown will have been carefully watched in Beijing. And in seeking to ease one sticky situation, Trump exacerbated another — lashing out at China with his 145% tariffs in an apparent effort to save face. As the chaos worsens, the White House added more confusion Friday night, exempting imports of Chinese-made smartphones and computers from the top tariff rate in an apparent acknowledgment that sky-high levies on those items could hammer the tech industry and US consumers. But on Sunday, the administration insisted that such products would still be subject to new tariffs at a lower level in the coming weeks, raising further questions about its apparently unplanned and knee-jerk stances, which have repeatedly scared markets. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump wrote Sunday on Truth Social. “There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’ The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,” he went on. Confusion in the administration’s messaging As it has several times, the administration is insisting that its sudden moves and inconsistent messaging were part of the plan all along. “This is just another great example of how President Trump had a detailed plan from the beginning that’s being executed exactly as directed,” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” He explained the administration’s thinking that such items are vital to US national security and thus required different treatment for “reshoring” factories that make them. The administration insists its strategy is working, arguing that scores of countries included in the now-paused reciprocal tariffs have rushed to offer stunning deals to Trump to escape American pressure. The White House is now applying similar logic to China, betting that the might of the US economy will force Xi to offer concessions on long-held grievances that include concerns over market access, intellectual property theft and a vast trade imbalance that Trump insists is proof Beijing is ripping off Washington. “It’s kind of almost a two-world system. There’s a process about China, and that’s very, very nascent … and then the process for everybody else,” Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “So the process for everybody else is orderly, it’s clear. People are coming to town with great, great offers.” The Trump approach is risky, and it may fail to take into account the complexities of the US-China relationship and the political dynamics in Beijing. This is because Xi’s attempt to turn his country into a dominant great power is founded in a conceit that the US and other Western powers have historically adopted colonial-style policies to suppress Chinese influence and deprive it of its rightful place in the world. This makes it almost impossible for Xi to be seen as caving to what China regards as US bullying. analysis
      Trump’s drive against top universities could carry a big economic cost Still, the administration has dismissed warnings that China can hurt the US as badly as Washington can hurt it. “They’re playing with a pair of twos,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week on CNBC. He argued that since the US exports only a fifth of the total value of goods Beijing sends to the US, its economy would come off worse in a tit-for-tat trade war. That reasoning and Trump’s confidence that his typical brinksmanship and raising of the stakes to intolerable levels, which he honed as a real estate mogul in New York, will be tested in the days to come. If Trump does manage to reframe the US trading relationship with China, he will claim a significant achievement in a new era of Washington relations with Beijing. For years, presidents of both parties reasoned that by liberalizing China’s previously controlled economy, the US could usher its rival into the global rule-based trading system and promote political reforms inside the country. But that calculus began to change at the end of the Obama administration, and Xi’s nationalistic rule sharpened the economic and geopolitical showdown between the two sides. Trump ‘has the ball’ Trump has argued with some justification that expanded trade with China has built a superpower foe that US leaders in both parties now regard as the premier threat to US national security and global power. At the same time, however, cheap clothes and consumer goods such as iPhones have massively improved the material circumstances of millions of Americans, even as globalization has hollowed out US manufacturing heartlands and left a trail of social blight. Despite the rising tensions and more nervousness to come on the stock markets this week, Trump’s aides on Sunday defended the president’s approach, which risks tipping into recession an economy that was humming along when he took office less than three months ago. “This is unfolding exactly like we thought it would in a dominant scenario,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He added: “We’ve got 90 deals in 90 days possibly pending here.” That kind of success rate in negotiating trade deals, which normally take years to clinch, would be remarkable — one reason why many analysts don’t take the administration’s bombast about offers from foreign nations at face value. The possibility remains that countries such as Japan, India and South Korea, as well as the European Union, will offer Trump splashy concessions he can claim as a big win while they do not fundamentally change bilateral trading relationships. That would mean one of Trump’s core justifications for the tariff war — remaking American manufacturing — would not be achieved. Cosmetic wins for Trump would also fail to justify the trillions of dollars his actions have wiped off global stock markets and the losses he’s inflicted on millions of Americans’ retirement accounts. There are growing signs that the president’s chaotic economic management is depressing his political standing in a way that will be particularly sensitive for Republican lawmakers in the year before the midterm elections. A new CBS poll Sunday showed that the president’s approval ratings over his handling of the economy and inflation have dipped. Some 44% of respondents approve and 56% disapprove of his performance on the economy, while only 40% approve and 60% disapprove on his handling of inflation.  And 75% expect at least short-term price spikes due to tariffs, while 48% expect long-term increases. These are shaky numbers considering that the real impact of tariffs is yet to be felt by consumers in terms of rising prices. And Trump’s bet is particularly hazardous given that his promise to lower the costs of food and housing was at the center of his win over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris last November. Despite the tense times, one of Trump’s loudest boosters in the Cabinet, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, remains bombastic. “Donald Trump has the ball. I want him to have it. He’s the right person with it,” Lutnick said on ABC News’ “This Week.” “He knows how to play this game. He knows how to deal with President Xi. This is the right person for the right role, and I am confident this is going to work out with China.” Yet the mystique of Trump as a master dealmaker, which has been more central to the president’s political appeal than anything else, has never faced a tougher test.",,0.26859670877456665
"Only three months into his new term, President Donald Trump is escalating a battle against institutions that challenge his strongman instincts, including the courts, the legal profession, elite education and the media. The administration is projecting presidential authority in a broader and more overt way than any modern White House. Its expansive interpretation of statutes and questionable interpretations of judges’ rulings is causing alarm about its impact on the rule of law, freedom of expression and the Constitution. “There’s something broken,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday. “The liberal establishment – but they’re not running things anymore in this country.” He sat beside President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, who brands himself as the world’s “coolest dictator” and whose huge popularity is based on a brand of elected authoritarianism Trump admires. The warmth lavished on a leader who’d have been treated as a pariah by a conventional US administration was an ominous window into the 47th president’s future intentions. Bukele has suspended parts of the Salvadoran constitution and imprisoned tens of thousands of people without due process in a crackdown against crime. He suggested Trump might try something similar. “Mr. President, you have 350 million people to liberate, you know. But to liberate 350 million people, you have to imprison some. You know, that’s the way it works, right?” Trump’s own hardline aspirations were revealed in the meeting through the prism of his increasingly ruthless deportation policy, which is raising profound questions about apparent abuses of due process and human rights. Both presidents relished the chance to publicly refuse to release an undocumented migrant who was seized in Maryland and deported to a notorious mega-prison in his native El Salvador without a court hearing and despite a judge’s order that he should not be sent back to the country. The White House is refusing to act on another judge’s order that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia should be brought back to the US and is walking a fine line on a Supreme Court decision saying it must facilitate his return. It says Abrego Garcia is a gang member and terrorist despite producing no public evidence. It also argues that US courts have no jurisdiction because Abrego Garcia’s fate is bound up in Trump’s power to set foreign policy. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 last week that the administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia after it admitted expelling him over an administrative error. But the White House is using its rather imprecise language – perhaps motivated by a push for unity or a desire to avoid a direct constitutional showdown – to claim the justices endorsed its position, rather than rebuking it. “I think the Supreme Court is responsible to some extent because they diced words,” retired judge Shira Scheindlin told CNN’s John Berman on Monday. But Scheindlin warned the administration was entering dangerous ground. “What we have here is a defiance of the Supreme Court order. The Supreme Court said facilitate his return and expedite it.” Scheindlin added: “It’s defiance which puts us on the edge of a constitutional crisis between the judicial branch and the executive branch.” Laurence Tribe, a renowned constitutional scholar, told CNN Monday that the administration’s defiance made it likely the case would end up back before the Supreme Court – which would then face a fateful choice. “It is not just immigrants who are subject to this kind of game. It is a deadly game that could be played with any citizen,” Tribe, professor emeritus at Harvard Law told Kaitlan Collins, who had earlier questioned Trump and Bukele in the Oval Office. “The president has already begun to play it. That is not the country that any of us I think grew up in.” Indeed, Trump is mulling an even more flagrant challenge to the law. He suggested that his scheme to deport those who he says are gang members and terrorists to harsh El Salvadorian prisons could be widened. “I’d like to go a step further, I mean … I don’t know what the laws are. We always have to obey the laws,” Trump said, looking at Attorney General Pam Bondi on a White House sofa. “But we also have home-grown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they’re not looking, that are absolute monsters. I’d like to include them in the group of people – to get them out of the country.” The idea that the administration would ignore constitutional protections available to all Americans, even those who are incarcerated, and deport them to draconian prison camps overseas might strain credulity. But Trump’s words came amid an atmosphere of growing authoritarianism around his White House and an apparent determination to reject constitutional constraints on his behavior. Elite law and education are in Trump’s sights The White House’s power moves suggest it does not just want to unilaterally decide who gets deported, based on its own criteria and not those of the courts. It also wants to heavily influence the caseloads of big-time law firms; what is taught in top universities; and the news Americans see on television. These are classic pages from the playbooks of strongman leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, another Trump hero, who established his power by reining in the independence of the law, the media and academia. In recent days, Trump has increased pressure on top law firms that took cases or employed attorneys he sees as hostile to his political interests, extracting deals for hundreds of millions of dollars of “pro bono” work on cases to be named later. The White House has also threatened numerous universities with funding cuts if they don’t make changes to school policy and even what they teach. Separately on Sunday, he demanded punishment for CBS’ “60 Minutes” and called on the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the network’s license. A president who campaigned for a second term on a promise to purge the weaponization of the Justice Department last week used his power to order probes into two critics, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, who served in his first administration. And Elon Musk’s unilateral decisions on firing officials and shredding federal funding for government agencies already awarded by Congress seems designed to outrace the courts’ capacity to assess their legality. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, has been wielding vast power to cancel the visas of hundreds of foreign students, some of whom took part in anti-Israel protests. He argues their activities are detrimental to US foreign policy – a sweeping rationale that might be used to curtail almost any speech. Several foreign students have been approached in the street and taken into immigration custody hundreds of miles away or forced to flee the country. On Monday, Palestinian student Mohsen Mahdawi went into a Vermont immigration office hoping to begin the final step to becoming a US citizen. But the Columbia University student, who has been in the US for a decade, was taken away in handcuffs, his lawyer told CNN. And the cronyism that often afflicts hardline regimes that thwart democratic freedoms seems to be taking root in Washington. Trump, for instance, signaled that he was open to negotiations with top CEOs for opt-outs from his tariffs that have rocked the US and global economies. Trump won his second term partly on a promise to his supporters to eviscerate an elite establishment that he argues is contemptuous toward many Americans and infected by extreme liberal values on race and gender. This is a popular stance among many voters – especially in Trump’s political base, for whom he mostly seems to govern. A cultural assault on institutions regarded as dominated by elites is also a useful distraction from his trade war chaos and the failure so far of his peace initiative in Ukraine. Trump’s wild rhetoric and obvious belief that he has limitless power – reinforced by a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity – have long caused his critics to warn, sometimes in overly alarmist terms, that he’s a dictator-in-waiting. But his refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election and his fresh efforts to thwart government accountability, legal processes and even the freedom of expression are adding up. Mammoth political and legal battles are beginning But some of the institutions are fighting back. Harvard University on Monday rejected the administration’s demands for policy changes. “The University will not surrender its independence or its constitutional rights,” Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement. The administration quickly froze several billion dollars in federal funding for the Ivy League school. The White House had demanded changes to Harvard’s diversity, equity and inclusion programs; a ban on masks at campus protests; and reforms to merit-based hiring and admissions. It wanted to reduce the power held by faculty and administrators. Harvard’s decision could establish a precedent for other higher education institutions to follow suit. But Columbia University submitted to administration demands for restrictions on demonstrations and new disciplinary procedures, and immediate reviewed its Middle East curriculum. The pattern of resistance and some submission to Trump policies is also playing out in the legal industry. Two large firms, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which have huge Washington practices, have sued the administration to challenge Trump executive orders targeting them and their clients. They accuse the government of using unconstitutional executive orders to punish or chill speech it doesn’t like. The administration’s singling out of journalists prompted the Associated Press to take its case to the courts after its journalists were banned from the travel pool on Air Force One and events in the Oval Office over the newswire and photo agency’s refusal to follow Trump’s lead in renaming the Gulf of Mexico in its stylebook. A federal judge last week deemed the White House’s punishment of the AP unconstitutional. Trump’s next challenge to the rule of law is likely to play out on Tuesday in the latest hearing of the case of Abrego Garcia, who was picked off the streets of suburban Maryland and sent to the El Salvador mega-prison. The Justice Department has responded to a federal judge’s orders to detail daily efforts to bring him back with challenges to the court’s authority. Joseph Mazzara, an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a sworn statement Monday that the agency “does not have authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.” This followed Bukele’s statement a few hours before suggesting cooperation with the White House. “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don’t – I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” the Salvadoran president said. The administration response shows it is doing nothing to bring Abrego Garcia back. It’s beginning to look like yet another attempt to evade the authority of the judiciary. On this and many other fronts, the sense of a coming constitutional collision is growing impossible to ignore.",,0.2919997572898865
"President Donald Trump’s escalating confrontation with Harvard University marks a new stage in his administration’s offensive against elite universities — a campaign that threatens both the nation’s most economically dynamic metropolitan areas and America’s global competitiveness. From Boston and Austin to Seattle and Silicon Valley, these elite research universities have served as the catalysts for growth in the nation’s most productive regional economies. They have produced a steady stream of scientific breakthroughs and skilled young graduates who flow into companies pursuing cutting-edge technologies in computing, communications, artificial intelligence, medical equipment, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and other advanced industries. “This is the fundamental economic geography of the high-value, advanced industry system in America,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Metro think tank. “This is American industrial policy at work.” But now the Trump administration is threatening to stall this economic engine by terminating research grants for major universities, cutting overall federal support for scientific research, and deporting international students over their political activities. After months of caution and capitulation from other universities, Harvard’s announcement Monday that it would fight Trump’s demands for sweeping changes to its operations and academic programs could mark a turning point that heralds greater resistance from colleges and their communities.

      More than 500 student visas revoked as the government expands reasons for deportation “This is about the well-being of our constituents and it’s also about the future of our communities,” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in an interview. The research grants the Trump administration is rescinding, she said, “are not on or off switches that affect (only) the current moment or current generation; these are investments in our collective future.”  For communities whose economies revolve around major research universities, she said, stopping Trump’s moves against them represents “survival stakes.” Despite some improvement for Trump in the 2024 election, the regions surrounding these big universities voted preponderantly against him last year. So, in targeting elite research universities that conservatives deride as strongholds of “the woke mind virus,” Trump may believe he is hurting only places already hostile to him. But because these universities are so integrated into their surrounding regions, Trump cannot hurt these campuses without also harming the metro areas leading the country’s domestic economic growth. And because those metro areas have become the nation’s principal incubators of scientific and technological advances, harming them also harms the nation’s international competitiveness, particularly as it faces a mounting challenge from China in critical emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. In the global competition for 21st-century economic supremacy, Trump’s wide-ranging assault on America’s top research institutions may come to be seen as a profound act of unilateral disarmament. The government-academia-business axis Collaboration among the government, academia and business to promote scientific and technological advances traces back to the earliest days of American history. But the partnership between the government and universities ascended to a new height during World War II. Under the leadership of Vannevar Bush, a legendary engineer and university administrator, Washington enlisted academic scientists into the war effort to an unprecedented extent (a process that included the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb). A landmark report from Bush in 1945 inspired the creation of the National Science Foundation in 1950 to promote basic research in science and engineering. The National Institutes of Health has long provided parallel support for basic medical research. Washington further expanded its role in nurturing basic research after the Soviet Union shocked the world by launching the Sputnik satellite in 1957. The big increase in federal support for education and scientific research after Sputnik was the moment when “universities and government became joined in terms of the future of this society,” said Ira Harkavy, director of the Netter Center for Community Partnerships at the University of Pennsylvania. The fruits of that collaboration included the scientific advances that produced the semiconductor and the internet. Related article
      Heat from Trump administration puts higher education leaders in ‘terrible position’ with so much at stake In recent decades, basic scientific research conducted at elite universities has become the cornerstone of America’s most innovative industries, said Martin Kenney, a professor in the Community and Regional Development Program at the University of California at Davis. Since about 1980, he said, the US “innovation system” has informally evolved into a three-step process in which new technologies start with basic research at academic institutions; are honed at startup companies funded through venture capital; and ultimately are commercialized at scale once those startups are bought by larger existing companies or taken to the stock market through initial public offerings. “That was the way the United States decided to compete globally and (to develop) the highest-end technology,” Kenney said. That genealogy is evident in many of the nation’s most economically vibrant metropolitan areas. Many cities now benefit from large amounts of direct employment and local purchases from medical and academic institutions — what urban planners call “meds and eds.” But even greater may be the spinoff economic effects from big scientific and medical institutions. The regions that house the nation’s most advanced companies in fields such as biotechnology, computing and artificial intelligence almost all orbit around world-class universities and medical centers, which have generated both scientific breakthroughs and a talent pipeline critical to those industries’ growth. Places that have benefited from this dynamic include Boston, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, Houston, Los Angeles and the Research Triangle in North Carolina (with three universities each among the top 100 recipients in federal research grants); New York City (with four); and Austin, Seattle and Madison, Wisconsin, each of which is home to its state’s flagship public university, also a top 100 grant recipient. A Brookings Metro analysis provided exclusively to CNN found that of the 100 US counties that generate the most economic output, 44 are home to a university that ranks among the top 100 in receiving federal research grants. Forty-one of the 100 counties producing the most economic output also contain at least one or more of the 100 institutions graduating the most PhDs in science and engineering. (Several other top 100 output counties, like San Mateo outside San Francisco and Essex outside Boston, benefit from the economic activity spun off from nearby universities even though they don’t house one themselves.) These counties far outpunch their weight in generating economic activity. The 44 high-output counties that house at least one major research university represent less than 1.5% of the nation’s roughly 3,100 counties. But they generate nearly 35% of the nation’s total economic output, Brookings Metro found. “People look at the US innovation system as something that is immutable and durable,” Muro said. “But these are actually delicate ecosystems that have been built up over 50 years. This is one of the great achievements of post-World War II American economic development. And that could be gravely disrupted here.” The explosive growth in Madison and its suburbs show how these pieces fit together. Many of the region’s biggest employers trace their products back to research conducted at the University of Wisconsin at Madison (which ranks No. 15 as a recipient of federal research grants) and recruit university graduates as workers, said Zach Brandon, president of the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce. These include a concentration of companies developing advanced medical treatments and technologies, led by Epic, the huge software company that created the MyChart app and was founded by a University of Wisconsin graduate. The success of these companies, which has made Madison the state’s fastest-growing area, demonstrates that “when you really think about making what’s next, inventing the future, that’s happening because of research at our world class universities,” Brandon said. How Trump is targeting top universities On multiple fronts, the Trump administration is now threatening that pipeline from academia to business. It has canceled, suspended or announced reviews into billions of dollars in combined federal grants to seven institutions that rank among the 100 top recipients of government research funds: Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Brown and the University of Pennsylvania, with Northwestern and Cornell added to the list last week. The administration has targeted these institutions primarily because of their response to campus protests against the war in Gaza, but also over their policies on racial diversity in admissions, cooperation with immigration enforcement and allowing transgender women to compete in sports. Another 19 universities that rank among the top 100 federal grant recipients were among those notified in a March letter from the Education Department that they faced the possible funding losses over allegations of failing to protect students from antisemitism. Separately, Johns Hopkins University lost $800 million in grants and contracts from the administration’s sweeping cuts at the US Agency for International Development, which forced it to dismiss some 2,000 employees. Simultaneously, the administration has slowed the distribution of National Science Foundation grants: One recent analysis found the NSF approved about 50% fewer grants in the first two months of Trump’s second term as it did in the equivalent period last year. Last week, the NSF announced it is funding fellowships for only half as many graduate students as it did last year. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the economic implications of its policies toward scientific research and major universities. No Trump policy change has rattled academia more than the National Institutes of Health’s February announcement that it is slashing the share of federal research dollars that universities can apply to ongoing overhead costs. Universities have relied on those so-called indirect expenses to build the infrastructure that underpins their scientific research, from constructing labs to hiring support staff. The administration has defended the change as an effort to ensure that more federal dollars flow directly into research rather than ancillary activities. But scientists and university administrators have said the change would force massive cutbacks in research. Earlier this month, a district court judge in Maryland permanently blocked Trump from making the change, but the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority has already overturned several similar lower court rulings. Supporters of university research see another threat: the administration’s repeated moves to deport foreign students, including several for political viewpoints they expressed about the Israel-Hamas war. “If you are a smart kid in India or China, you are going to ask: ‘Why am I going to go to the United States?’” Kenney said. These pincer moves have divided academic administrators, with some schools conceding to the administration’s demands (such as Columbia) and others pledging to fight them (Princeton). But the implications of these cutbacks will reverberate far beyond campus walls. “It’s not just the university presidents who are nervous; it’s going to be the regional economic developers and the regional business leaders who will be extremely concerned about the interruptions that are coming,” Muro said.

      Harvard University professors sue Trump administration to block review of nearly $9 billion in federal funds Brandon, of Madison, is one of those concerned business leaders. He’s working to revive an organization of local chambers of commerce to lobby Washington to support federal funding for scientific research.   “The basic research of today is the applied research of tomorrow and is the innovation of the future,” he said. “If we turn off that tap, sure you could go four years, you can maybe go eight years, but eventually the innovation drought comes.” Wu, the Boston mayor, similarly organized a bipartisan group of 45 local officials to join the lawsuit to block the administration’s cuts in indirect costs for NIH grant recipients. Trump’s offensive against research universities, she said, “is different from what has ever happened before, where individual communities and industries are being targeted and punished.” Trump gained ground in 2024 in the nation’s most economically productive places, but they still voted heavily against him. According to Brookings Metro, former Vice President Kamala Harris won 40 of the 44 high-output counties that also house at least one top research university. Those 40 counties alone accounted for nearly 40% of Harris’ votes nationwide; the four top counties Trump won in that group, by contrast, accounted for only 5% of his votes. Even the domestic political consequences of Trump’s moves against major universities, though, may pale beside the international implications. Some scientific and business leaders have described China’s striking recent advances in AI technology as a modern equivalent to the Sputnik shock that galvanized the nation in the late 1950s. Yet Trump is responding in exactly the opposite way as the nation did then, when it surged federal support for research and education. “If we are going to have a ‘Sputnik moment’ on AI and (related) technologies,” Muro said, “this does not seem like a winning response.” Trump’s escalating war against top-tier American universities and the big blue metros that orbit them might channel his base’s antagonism toward “coastal elites,” but the ultimate winner in this confrontation may be China.

"Harvard University is such a perfect foil for Trumpism that it’s a wonder it avoided the MAGA maelstrom for so long. But the nation’s oldest university is now going head-to-head with a White House that sees few limits on its power, which it wants to use to shatter elite societal pillars. Harvard President Alan Garber decided not to bend to administration demands to change its policies, declaring that the university would not “surrender its independence or its constitutional rights.” A university more used to producing presidents than defying them thus set off one of the most important clashes yet between President Donald Trump and an establishment institution. Those without an Ivy League pedigree often mock the snobbery of the country’s most prestigious seats of learning, whose degrees open elite circles off-limits to most Americans. And when Trump portrays the esteemed academics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as far-left activists pushing “woke” policies on race and gender, he’s not working in a vacuum. Millions of Americans agree with him. Polls show rising distrust of higher education institutions, especially among Republicans. But Trump’s assault on the country’s top colleges goes beyond an issue that will excite his political base. Related article
      The real stakes in Trump’s confrontation with Harvard Administration heat on top universities is part of a broader effort to challenge centers of what it regards as liberal power, which also include the courts, the federal bureaucracy and the media. After remaking the Republican Party and the Supreme Court, Trump hopes to extend his populist ideology to higher education as a way to challenge belief systems that conflict with his MAGA creed and to shift the country hard to the right. Trump is not only taking on top academics and what surveys show are their left-leaning faculties. His immigration crackdown has stirred a culture of fear on campuses: Some students have been taken off the streets by border agents, while hundreds more have had their visas canceled on the grounds that their views are damaging to American foreign policy interests. That sense of repression threatens to stifle the atmosphere of open debate that animates a healthy university. And Trump’s threats to halt funding for top schools endangers the country’s world-leading scientific and medical research into killer diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s. White House demands go far beyond antisemitism complaints Academics are often accused of living in an isolated bubble. This was driven home in December 2023, when New York Rep. Elise Stefanik skewered the presidents of top universities over campus protests that critics say degenerated into antisemitism following the Hamas attacks on Israel. The academics’ nuanced answers might have passed muster in a campus seminar, but they turned into a political catastrophe. The moral outrage of Stefanik, a Harvard graduate, helped lead to the resignation of the university’s president Claudine Gay. The New York lawmaker’s performances also made her one of the fastest-rising stars in the MAGA movement and the House GOP leadership. Stefanik led the charge against Harvard again on Tuesday after the administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funds when the university refused its demands. “If you look at the faculty, the tenured faculty of all these schools, they are so out of touch with American values. Ninety-seven percent of the faculty are self-identified Democrats, progressives. They are propping up these radical, far-left ideas and really teaching anti-Americanism,” Stefanik said on Fox News. The administration has used the antisemitism charges to fuel both its wider assault on the universities and its mass deportation drive. It demanded that Harvard commission an outside party to audit multiple programs, schools and departments within the university that it said were tainted by egregious records of antisemitism or other bias. But its stunning list of demands doesn’t end there. It called for an end to all diversity, equity and inclusion programs, including reductions in the power of the faculty; ending any hiring based on race, religion or sex; and new crackdowns on student protests and student groups and clubs, including those that support Palestinian sovereignty – a longtime, if lapsed, US government policy. And the White House demanded investigations into past campus protests and sit-ins that took place in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks on Israel. The wish list represented an unusual attempt by a presidential administration to exert power over an independent university. The showdown, which follows agreement by other universities – including Columbia – to cede to similar pressure, is almost certain to land in the courts. But Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary and Harvard president, told CNN that the university should not comply with a government that is being “extra-lawful.” He added: “Universities are in need of a great deal of reform, and it’s come too slowly, but that’s not a reason why the government can entirely suspend the law and make up self-serving political demands and impose them on universities.” Trump may believe he’s onto a political winner whatever happens. When universities cave, fearful of losing billions of dollars in public funding, his power is enhanced – and he can pile on even more pressure. When they defend themselves, they give him a fight he’s happy to wage. And when Democrats criticize him, they take the side of what millions of Americans believe are elitist establishment figures who are disliked by much of the country. Disdain for top universities runs deep in the MAGA movement – perhaps mostly among Ivy Leaguers like Stefanik and Vice President JD Vance, who often appear to be seeking to atone to their base for their own elite educations. This populist backlash against establishment institutions is at the root of the MAGA movement and “America first” conservativism, along with a belief that liberal faculties are responsible for propagating a belief system that is anti-American. For instance, at a National Conservatism Conference in 2021, Vance, a Yale Law School graduate, advocated a campaign against “very hostile institutions” and added, “If any of us want to do the things we want to do for our country and the people who live in it – we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.” On the campaign trail last year, Trump lambasted universities he claimed were packed with “Marxist maniacs.”And the president’s movement has long fostered suspicion of academic intellectualism and a distrust of the highly educated, which was exacerbated by his attack on experts during the Covid-19 pandemic in his first term and which now shows in his unorthodox second-term Cabinet. This highly politicized approach leaves little doubt that the administration’s motives go far beyond eradicating antisemitism from college campuses. “It’s a transparent effort to change what is taught, what we say in our classrooms, what we teach our students, to make sure that the only things that are actually said on university campuses are things that the Trump administration wants to hear and wants to be said,” Andrew Manuel Crespo, a Harvard Law School professor, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Monday. Fear on campus The administration’s heavy-handed immigration enforcement has also fueled a repressive atmosphere on campuses following the detention of several students who took part in campus protests against Israel and some who did not. The Trump administration last week won a deportation order from a Louisiana immigration judge against Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident. He was accused of undermining US policy to combat antisemitism, but the government cited no allegations of criminal activity. Khalil, who is married to a US citizen, is a prominent Palestinian activist who played a central role in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza on campus last year In another case, Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was detained last month by masked officers near Somerville, Massachusetts. She told a federal judge Monday she was unconstitutionally arrested and subjected to “unsanitary, unsafe and inhumane” conditions in a Louisiana immigration facility. The government has accused her of activities “in support of Hamas” but the Washington Post reported a State Department office failed to find evidence tying her to antisemitism or terrorism. This week, a Palestinian student at Columbia University went into a Vermont immigration office for his citizenship interview. But the student, Mohsen Mahdawi – who’s been in the United States for a decade – was taken away in handcuffs. His attorney told CNN that he was detained “in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian.” Ranjani Srinivasan, another Columbia University student, fled to Canada after she got an email about her student visa being canceled and federal agents came to her door. She told CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz that she’d simply been caught up in a police cordon near an anti-Israel protest as she tried to walk home. Lawyers and civil rights campaigners warn that these cases, and many others, are symptomatic of an administration that disdains the law and free speech. Sarah Paoletti, a professor and director of the Transnational Legal Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School, warned of imperiled “due process and other fundamental and constitutional rights.” Paoletti added: “It’s also having the effect of silencing and instilling a tremendous amount of fear. And there’s an intentionality behind that. Many within this administration have long been proponents of this notion of ‘make it bad enough that people will self deport, save us the effort and the money.’ And you see that through these actions, where the underlying message is, ‘if you don’t self deport, these are the consequences.” The targeting of universities may also stifle the freewheeling essence of American higher education, according to Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “People come from all over the world to study at American universities, in part because there are other people from all over the world there … You get to hear from people with extremely different experiences, life experiences and perspectives and political views, religious views. You know, that’s what makes American universities great,” Jaffer told CNN’s Audie Cornish in an interview for her podcast “The Assignment.” “But if the non-citizens are intimidated from speaking out or participating in public discourse, that has a cost not just to them, but to the rest of us.”",,0.24162393808364868
"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. CNN’s report that the IRS is making plans to revoke Harvard University’s tax-exempt status the day after President Donald Trump suggested it represents an unprecedented use of presidential power over the tax code. While there are examples of colleges losing or failing to achieve tax-exempt status, this has never come on the heels of a president’s express wish. The IRS is supposed to be immune from politics. Presidents aren’t supposed to direct IRS investigations US law specifically prohibits presidents from directing the IRS to investigate anyone in a section entitled: “Prohibition on executive branch influence over taxpayer audits and other investigations.” While the IRS falls under the Treasury Department, it’s important that it be as protected from politics as possible. That’s why the IRS has only two politically appointed officials, according to Mark Mazur, who was assistant secretary of treasury for tax policy at the outset of the Biden administration The US has higher voluntary tax payment rates than other countries, Mazur told me, “because people feel that their interactions with the tax system are fair and based on law.” If the IRS is suddenly used for political purposes, that trust could be destroyed. During the Obama administration, for instance, the IRS became embroiled in a bona fide scandal when a Treasury Department investigation found the IRS delayed conferring tax-exempt status on conservative groups. If the IRS did find that its tax-exempt status should be revoked, Harvard would need to be warned and given an opportunity to contest the finding. It would also have the opportunity to challenge the IRS in court. There is already a lot of chaos at the IRS under the new Trump administration. Multiple acting commissioners have resigned, apparently the result a standoff over whether tax data could be used by immigration officials. It would not be unprecedented for a university to lose its tax-exempt status Back in 1983, the Supreme Court agreed that Bob Jones University should not be tax-exempt because, at the time, it banned interracial relationships among its students. The university didn’t drop its interracial marriage policy until 2000 — in an announcement on CNN’s Larry King Live, coincidentally — although it did not regain its tax-exempt status until 2017. The US has now come full circle to the point that one of the main gripes Trump has with Harvard is its diversity programs. Harvard vs. Trump If there’s one American university that should be able to stand up to the Trump administration, it’s Harvard. The nation’s most famous institution of higher learning has resources. Its endowment exceeds $50 billion. It also has allies. A shocking number of Republican and Democratic lawmakers are alumni — nearly 10% of representatives and nearly 20% of senators, according to one estimate. But for all of its wealth and cachet, the institution relies on federal funding and its tax-exempt status like every other major research university. After Harvard rejected the Trump administration’s demand for access to and review of Harvard’s employment, hiring and admissions data, as well as the discontinuation of all diversity programs, Trump said on social media that the university’s tax-exempt status should be rescinded. The long-term question will be what would happen to Harvard without federal dollars and exemption from billions of dollars it might owe in taxes if it lost that status — not only to the federal government, but perhaps also to the state of Massachusetts. Why are universities tax-exempt? Harvard, along with most major public and private US colleges, is exempt from paying taxes because of its status as a nonprofit organization. Like churches and charities, universities fall under section 501(c)3 of US tax code. The idea, which is written into the law, is that their benefit to society — in this case, education and research — outweighs the need for the tax base they would provide. Not all institutes of higher learning go this route, as Trump is intimately aware. His now-defunct Trump University was a for-profit organization that was sued for fraud by former presidents. Trump settled the lawsuits. Tax-exempt universities, on the other hand, must refrain from endorsing candidates or influencing legislation, among other things. They must publicly provide annual reports on their activities and finances. ‘In harmony with the public interest’ The IRS and the US have challenged the tax-exempt status of universities and other organizations, as occurred with South Carolina’s fundamentalist Bob Jones University. The IRS challenged Bob Jones’ status in 1970, but the Supreme Court didn’t rule until 1983 that in order to be tax-exempt an organization must, “demonstrably serve and be in harmony with the public interest, and the institution’s purpose must not be so at odds with the common community conscience as to undermine any public benefit that might otherwise be conferred.” For many years the IRS withheld tax-exempt status granted to religious organizations from the Church of Scientology, but reversed course in 1997 after a long and unconventional campaign by Scientologists. Trump has already taxed universities like Harvard Interestingly, the tax law Trump signed during his first term levied a new tax on the wealthiest universities, including Harvard. The 1.4% excise tax on universities with more than $500,000 per student in their endowments applied to 58 universities in 2022, according to the Tax Policy Center, and raised $244 million. That tax still exists today. Lawmakers are currently revisiting that law, and it could provide another opportunity to take a hard look at the taxes paid — or not — by universities.",,0.1993802934885025
"To understand Donald Trump’s second term, just look at the fights he picks. The president and his top officials spent this week escalating confrontations over mass deportations, elite universities and transgender athletes on emerging fronts of his “common sense revolution.” Each is obviously an attempt to please the loyal MAGA political base and other elements of the coalition on which Trump anchored his two election wins. Trump’s team may also be trying to change the subject from his trade war chaos and his stalled Ukraine peace effort. But the idea that he’s engaged in an endless cycle of distraction to hide his failures became a cliche in his first term. In his second, it’s a lazy critique that fails to encapsulate his often-fateful acts of far greater substance aimed at transforming American life and the world. The administration fought on multiple fronts on Wednesday. It sued Maine for refusing to apply its transgender high school athlete ban. Top officials furiously worked to discredit an undocumented migrant mistakenly sent, without due process, to an El Salvadorian mega-prison who embodies their ruthless immigration policy. And they doubled down on an attempt to shape the policies, faculty, and student body at Harvard University as part of a crackdown on a bastion of liberal power. The controversies share some common traits that offer insight into Trump’s leadership. They demonstrate the president’s attempt to apply vast presidential power, often based on questionable constitutional grounds. All are likely to feature protracted legal battles that could ultimately test whether the country will tip into a constitutional crisis if the White House ignores judges’ rulings. Almost every showdown reflects the essential dynamics driving Trump’s character and politics: He chooses fights that demonstrate his strength over potentially weaker opponents. And his team adopts the relentless win-lose mindset that has defined Trump’s life as a real estate baron, reality star and president. There’s always an element of “owning the libs” about Trump’s approach in the choreographing of battles designed to crush progressive sensitivities. Often, they leave his opponents forced to defend unpopular institutions or constituencies that offer few political payoffs – like undocumented migrants – leading to hours of mockery on conservative media. But the administration’s plans aren’t just tactical. There’s also philosophical strategy at work. While the president sometimes seems uninterested in policy, some of his most influential second-term operatives are deeply ideological. Beyond Trump’s craving for disruption, there’s a coherent effort to destroy the pillars of the liberal establishment, to turn back civil rights and progressive liberal social victories, and even to reverse demographic change with immigration policy. And these fights also show that three months in, Trump’s sweeping claims of presidential authority risk taking the country down an authoritarian slope. There was a whiff of totalitarianism in the air this week when Trump played along with El Salvador’s self-styled “world’s coolest dictator” in the Oval Office. And a wrecking-ball president unleashing economic upheaval and carving even deeper national divides is posing a critical political question: Is this what voters thought they were getting or wanted from an election in which the country’s main concern seemed to be lowering prices after a punishing surge of inflation? Immigration: Trump’s favorite way to build his political power Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia has the misfortune of becoming a human pawn in a titanic political clash that those waging it cannot afford to lose. The sheet metal worker and undocumented migrant is incarcerated in a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador after being expelled in defiance of a judge’s order that he not be deported to his native country. At first, the administration admitted in court that it made an administrative error. But it is now misrepresenting a Supreme Court ruling that it must “facilitate” Garcia’s return amid a brewing constitutional showdown. Immigration was foundational for Trump’s political career. He’d barely descended the golden escalator in his New York skyscraper in 2015 to launch his campaign when he began slandering Mexican immigrants. In his 2024 presidential bid, he falsely claimed foreign nations were emptying prisons and asylums to create an alien “invasion” of the US to exploit the Biden administration’s failure to initially recognize and address surges of undocumented migrants. Trump’s demagoguery on migration has often worked. It animated nativist elements of his party and built a coalition that led to his GOP domination. And in a CNN/SSRS poll last month, 51% approved of his handling of immigration. It was the only one of a suite of issues in which he had majority support. That strength explains why Trump often returns to this magic formula when he’s facing heavy political weather. And it explains the politics of the White House’s refusal to back down on Abrego Garcia. Attorney General Pam Bondi warned on Wednesday that he’s “not coming back to our country.” Officials accuse Abrego Garcia of being a terrorist, an MS-13 gang member and a threat to the safety of Americans, although he has no criminal convictions and they haven’t produced public evidence of their claims. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted a protection order obtained by Abrego Garcia’s wife in 2021 after he allegedly assaulted her. She cranked up the political histrionics, accusing Democrats of rushing to defend “an illegal criminal, foreign terrorist, gang member, but also an apparent woman beater.” She added, “Nothing will change the fact that Abrego Garcia will never be a Maryland father; he will never live in the United States of America again.” Garcia Abrego’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, told CNN in a statement that she hadn’t pursued the matter in court, that they were able to work through their difficulties and that their marriage “only grew stronger.” This all reflected a potentially defining moment for Trump’s immigration policy. To bend would provoke questions about whether some of the other hundreds of migrants sent to El Salvador were also denied due process because of flimsy evidence that they are gang members. It could potentially undermine public support for Trump on a rare issue where he polls well. Abrego Garcia’s return could also lessen the culture of fear the administration has been creating with detentions and deportations designed to vastly slow arrivals at the border. And perhaps most importantly, a climbdown could puncture the conceit that the courts lack authority to constrain or compel the president’s behavior. At the same time, however, the plight of Abrego Garcia also risks become a broader political issue around perceived White House cruelty that could begin to erode Trump’s relatively strong ratings on immigration. Bondi takes up Trump’s transgender sports campaign Bondi, a star of the MAGA movement, also led another key administration push Wednesday, suing Maine over its refusal to comply with Trump’s ban on transgender athletes in high school sports. The lawsuit alleges the state is violating Title IX, the law that prohibits sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal aid. A clash is now set between presidential authority and state power. Maine says Trump’s order conflicts with its own Human Rights Act. The lawsuit could be a harbinger of similar efforts by Trump to use presidential power to enforce social policy in other states. This is another fight the White House loves. The president raised the issue in his meeting with El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele on Monday. “We have people that fight to the death because they think men should be able to play in women’s sports. And some of those sports, it wouldn’t matter much, but it still matters, but some of them are very dangerous for women,” he said. On the campaign trail, Trump frequently mocked trans athletes and bemoaned what conservatives say is the destruction of girls’ sports, despite instances of transgender athletes competing in women’s competitions being relatively rare. Trump is tapping into an issue that is perceived as a moral outrage in his own coalition, including among evangelicals and social conservatives. He’s also making a mainstream play with a crossover issue for some more moderate voters, like the suburban independents who helped him win all seven swing states in November. When Trump argues that he’s voicing “common sense,” he’s pitching suburban moms and dads worried about potential lost opportunities for their daughters if transgender athletes somehow come to dominate women’s sports. And by initiating classic backlash politics, he’s tapping into perceptions that progressives have gone far too far on social issues – in a way that has alienated some voters. But as with immigration, Trump’s approach victimizes individuals, creates a culture of fear among a marginalized community and raises the question of whether a president has the personal power to dictate the scope of individual rights. The ideological aspirations powering Trump’s attack on elite education The standoff with elite US universities is another classic example of Trumpism in action. He’s targeting institutions that conservatives believe are dominated by progressive extremists. Top colleges are also a source of the expertise and intellectual pursuits to which Trumpism is a reaction. And the clash raises suspicions of presidential overreach. The populist commander-in-chief seems delighted that Harvard – perhaps the nation’s greatest citadel of elitism – fought back, unlike some other top schools that fueled his power grab by bending to his wishes. “Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and ‘birdbrains’ who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students and so-called ‘future leaders,’” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday, encapsulating his political incentives in a dispute in which he’s threatening to cancel the university’s tax exemption. But there’s also a deeply ideological goal underpinning the attack on higher education. The White House is using anti-Israel protests that saw antisemitic incidents on some campuses to crack down on university administrators. But the president is also pursuing policies that could deliver for ideological conservatives, who have spent years pushing back on affirmative action policies and efforts to diversify faculty and student populations in the wake of the civil rights movement.",,0.31150221824645996
"Donald Trump is showing why independent central banks are a good idea. The president’s double tirade against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday conjured another dark cloud over financial markets and an economy repeatedly traumatized by his tariff and trade-war chaos. “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “I’m not happy with him.” Trump is furious that Powell has ignored his frequent demands for a swift lowering of interest rates that would potentially make it easier for Americans to borrow to buy homes and could improve consumer sentiment and boost stocks. The Fed made three consecutive rate cuts last year after bringing inflation nearly to target. But it has paused the strategy amid concerns over growing economic uncertainty, which have been exacerbated by Trump’s volatile leadership since taking office less than three months ago. On Thursday morning, a short-tempered Trump appeared incensed over Powell’s warning a day earlier that the tariffs would likely cause inflation and higher unemployment and that some of their burden “would be paid by the public.” Powell’s speech to the Economic Club of Chicago was the clearest statement yet by a key financial official about the potential impact of Trump’s policies. He was stating what almost every serious economist believes about the impact of tariffs. But his comments conflicted with the president’s quixotic belief in the almost mystical power of taxing imports and his insistence that such a strategy will not spike prices and pass higher costs on to consumers. Trump is fuming over economic criticism The context of Trump’s attack on Powell Thursday is also important. It came amid an angry defense of his economic management, in which he blamed President Joe Biden multiple times – even though the economy was humming when the Oval Office changed hands – before he turned on the Fed chief. The president’s tetchy mood left a very strong impression that he was seeking out scapegoats in case his trade war strategy fails and he can’t secure deals with nations he’s targeted with tariffs. “If things continue to go down and a deal is not made, he’s going to blame the downturn in the market on Jay Powell and say that it was because he didn’t cut the rates,” Wall Street trader Peter Tuchman told CNN’s Kate Bolduan on Thursday. The president did nothing to dispel the impression that his criticism of Powell was designed to trigger interest rate cuts that would help his own political priorities and prospects. “He’s going to have a lot of political pressure. You know … I think there’s a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates,” Trump said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, is a frequent critic of Powell. But she argued on CNBC that it is important that the Fed chair stay in his post. “I have tangled with him on a regular basis about both regulations and interest rates but understand this: If Chairman Powell can be fired by the president of the United States, it will crash markets in the United States,” Warren said. The Massachusetts senator, a former Harvard Law professor, argued that the strength of the US financial system relies on the idea that “the big pieces move independent of the politics.” She added: “If interest rates in the US are subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand, this doesn’t distinguish us from any two other two-bit dictatorship around the world where everyone knows that your big investment risk is: Will that dictator will wake up in the morning and have a tummy ache and decide to cause this problem or favor that friend?” Trump’s anger at Powell was exacerbated because the European Central Bank just cut rates for the seventh time in a year, causing him to ask why the Federal Reserve is not being similarly aggressive. “He’s too late — always too late. A little slow. And I’m not happy with him. I let him know it,” the president said. Previously, in an early morning post on his Truth Social network, Trump raised expectations that he could fire Powell by saying his “termination cannot come soon enough.” The president’s attacks, however, belie Powell’s record. His stewardship of the economy has been steady through a tumultuous period that included the Covid-19 pandemic and its subsequent financial crisis. And he steered inflation down from above 9% to its current rate of 2.4% without triggering widespread unemployment in a soft landing that many analysts did not believe was possible. Powell became Fed chair in 2018 after he was nominated by Trump. He was reappointed by President Joe Biden in 2022. His current term ends in May 2026. Why an independent Fed is important The Federal Reserve was set up by Congress in 1913 as an independent body to insulate it from the kind of political pressure that the president is imposing. Its mission is to secure stable prices and employment – a mission that sometimes puts it at odds with the short-term needs of lawmakers and presidents. If Trump were to acquire the power to manipulate interest rates at will – through a proxy Fed chair or otherwise – he’d spark confusion on the financial markets, buckle confidence in the US economy and almost certainly spike inflation. And it would be a further sign that America’s global reputation as a rock of financial stability is quickly eroding in his second term. Potential market turmoil – following wild drops and swings in share prices since Trump launched his tariff war this month – may be one factor in persuading Trump to leave Powell in place. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the president has talked about firing Powell but that senior officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have so far talked him out of it. It is generally accepted in Washington that the president lacks the power to dismiss board members overseeing independent agencies without cause. But the administration is hoping the Supreme Court will overturn a 1935 legal precedent on which such assumptions are based. Trump’s growing contempt for sound governance and the courts – and his constant efforts to expand presidential power on questionable terms – mean that Powell’s future is not certain. This is a White House that acts first and deals with the consequences of potential illegality later. But there’s a chance the president is just venting. After all, he repeatedly complained about Powell’s caution during his first term. Forbes reported last year that he ordered Wilbur Ross to call the Fed chief and order him to lower rates, citing the former Commerce secretary’s memoir. But Trump has also never been so unconstrained. In his new administration, he’s picked officials who are loath to temper his wildest instincts. Bessent is seen as a moderating influence. Earlier this week, he told Bloomberg that “monetary policy is a jewel box that’s got to be preserved.” But the Treasury secretary lacks significant political experience. And history shows that any subordinate who seeks to rein in the president could soon find themselves fired. New uncertainty over Powell’s future comes with the economy reeling from successive shocks over Trump’s tariff policy – especially the 145% duties imposed on Chinese imports. The impact of this hardline approach could soon hit in the form of high prices and shortages of key consumer goods and other items. While Trump has frozen reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries and says multiple governments are offering trade deals, it remains unclear whether he’ll be able to deliver on his goal of bringing back manufacturing and jobs in the short term. Consumer confidence has meanwhile been tumbling, and companies are struggling to set expectations and budgets for the year ahead, raising more fears that the economy could soon slip into recession. Even if Trump doesn’t try to dismiss Powell, but simply continues to talk about doing so, he could rattle investor confidence. This is why most presidents understand interest rate policy – as infuriating as it may often be – is best left to the independent Fed.",,0.2553527355194092
"As the pressure grows on congressional Republicans to identify cuts in Medicaid, they are crashing into a familiar problem: The changes that could save the most money would impose heavy costs on many of their own voters. Several key House Republicans have signaled in recent days that they may try to cut Medicaid spending by rolling back the expansion in eligibility for the working poor included in the Affordable Care Act approved under President Barack Obama. That option may be attractive to Republicans partly because the states that have most aggressively used that authority to expand eligibility mostly lean Democratic. Most House districts where more people than the national average receive health coverage through the Medicaid expansion are also held by Democrats, according to an exclusive new CNN analysis of data from KFF, a non-partisan health care think tank. But GOP constituencies would hardly be immune if Congress rescinds the expansion. Nearly three dozen House Republicans also represent districts where the number of people receiving coverage through that Medicaid expansion exceeds the national district average of about 61,600, the analysis found. And nearly two dozen GOP senators likewise represent states with a substantial population of enrollees covered through the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. “It’s really a similar pattern that we’ve seen with the Affordable Care Act generally – that it’s become so embedded in the health care system and the lives of people across the country that it becomes very hard to take it away,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF. Answers on whether the expansion is too entrenched for congressional Republicans to uproot could begin arriving as soon as May 7, when the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which holds jurisdiction over Medicaid, is expected to start marking up the GOP’s massive budget “reconciliation” plan. Medicaid expansion is a tempting target for GOP budget cuts For all the controversy around both President Donald Trump’s assaults on civil liberties and his tariff moves, it’s likely that the most politically consequential decision congressional Republicans face this year is how to balance spending and tax cuts in the budget package they are formulating. With Trump ruling out cuts in Social Security or Medicare benefits, Medicaid represents by far the largest pot of money available for the reductions that conservative budget hawks are demanding. The House budget resolution has instructed the Energy and Commerce Committee to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade; the Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that even if the committee completely zeroed out the other programs in its purview, it still could not reach that number without cutting Medicaid. Republicans have long viewed Medicaid, which now provides health coverage for about 83 million lower-income Americans, as a more vulnerable target than Medicare, which serves seniors; GOP attempts to cut Medicaid and convert it into a block grant were central to the 1990s budget showdowns between President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The bill House Republicans passed in 2017 to repeal the Affordable Care Act included major cutbacks in Medicaid, including a variation on the Gingrich-era block grant proposal. But both the Medicaid population and the GOP electoral coalition have evolved in ways that complicate the party’s choices. The ACA expanded eligibility for Medicaid to far more working poor people. Previously, single childless adults were not eligible for the program at any income level; the ACA allowed states to cover those making up to 138% of the federal poverty level ($15,650 for an individual and about $21,000 for a married couple in 2025). The ACA also allowed states to raise the eligibility level for parents of young children to 138% of the poverty level; many states, particularly in the South, had cut off eligibility for parents at far lower levels before. To encourage states to broaden coverage, the ACA committed Washington to funding 90% of the cost of the expansion population, much more than it pays states for other people covered through Medicaid (generally one-half to three-quarters, depending on the state). All but 10 states have now expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, covering more than 20 million people in all. Even as the ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder to more working poor families, Republicans extended their electoral reach down the income and educational ladder through the political realignment accelerated under Trump. The result, as I wrote recently with CNN senior producer Edward Wu, is that 64 House Republicans now represent districts in which the share of Medicaid recipients exceeds the average for all districts. Far more Republicans than Democrats also represent districts with greater than average prevalence of major health problems including diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure – a reflection of the GOP’s growing consolidation of lower-education, lower-income, often rural House districts. These shifts clearly have made congressional Republicans more uneasy about cutting Medicaid than in the 1990s, or even in 2017. But the Medicaid expansion population has remained a tempting target for them. For one thing, the expansion is tied to the ACA, or Obamacare, which many Republicans, from Trump on down, still disparage. The expansion population, which includes people above the poverty line, is also more susceptible to the traditional argument Republicans have wielded against social welfare programs: that they reward the “undeserving poor” who should be paying their own way. In recent weeks, multiple House Republicans have subtly, but tellingly, distinguished between Medicaid’s traditional enrollees – very low-income parents, people with disabilities, impoverished seniors – and those added under the ACA expansion. House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly called for revoking Medicaid eligibility for “able-bodied workers, for example, young men … who should never be on the program at all.” Even a dozen House Republicans from swing districts who wrote Johnson last week expressing caution about Medicaid reductions made a similar distinction: while they would oppose cuts hurting “vulnerable populations,” they also said they want to “fix flaws in the program that divert resources away from children, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and pregnant women — those who the program was intended to help.” (Emphasis added.) The most specific proposal for reversing the Medicaid expansion has come from Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health care think tank. Paragon has proposed to phase out the enhanced federal assistance for the expansion population over a decade, reducing it to the same reimbursement Washington offers for other recipients. “We’re 15 years post the ACA and I think the question for policy makers is: under what rationale should we paying more for childless adults than kids, pregnant women and people with disabilities on the program?” Brian Blase, the institute’s president and a health policy adviser to Trump during his first term, said in a recent interview. Paragon projects that about 3 million people would lose health care coverage from the shift. That’s largely because it anticipates that most of those removed from Medicaid would qualify for federal subsidies to buy private health insurance through the ACA marketplaces. But the Urban Institute, a center-left think tank, has projected that nearly 11 million people would lose health coverage if Congress revokes the enhanced Medicaid funding for the working poor. If states tried to maintain the current eligibility levels with their own funds, the Urban Institute found, it would require them to increase their Medicaid spending by about 25% annually, a virtual impossibility. Meanwhile, it would become much harder for people kicked off Medicaid to obtain coverage instead through the Obamacare exchanges if Republicans allow the enhanced ACA subsidies approved under President Joe Biden to expire this year, as they have signaled is likely. “If people in the expansion population lose coverage, they may be eligible on paper for the marketplace but many of them would not be able to afford it,” especially if the enhanced subsidies expire, said Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group. Medicaid cuts would not spare GOP districts The new analysis of the KFF data by Wu, the senior CNN producer, suggests Republicans are right in their instinct that ending the expansion would rattle more windows in Democratic than GOP-leaning areas. Ninety-eight Democrats represent districts where more people than the average are covered through the expansion, the analysis found. So many congressional Democrats represent big expansion populations , largely because the states that have added the most people through the expansion tend to be places where Democrats are highly competitive, including blue states California, New York, Illinois, Oregon and Virginia, as well as purple battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona, which are all in the top 10. Democrats, in fact, hold 46 more House seats than Republicans in the states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility, Wu calculated. Conversely, Republicans in Congress are less exposed, largely because the 10 states that have refused to expand Medicaid – headlined by Texas, Florida and Georgia – all lean red, with the exception of Wisconsin (where the GOP-controlled legislature has long blocked expansion). Nearly 40% of House Republicans represent just those 10 states. Even so, the number of House Republicans from expansion states with large numbers of residents – and health care providers – who have come to rely on the new coverage still far exceeds the number of defections that would sink any budget plan. Thirty-two House Republicans also hold seats with an above-average number of expansion beneficiaries; 14 of them represent districts with 80,000 or more Medicaid expansion enrollees. And while the total number of expansion enrollees is greatest in Democratic-held districts (about 12.6 million), the 6.8 million in GOP seats still constitute a very large number of potential voters. Likewise, 22 Republican senators have been elected from the 29 states that have covered at least 100,000 people under the expansion, according to the KFF data. Another factor could make Republicans hesitate about unwinding the expansion: its importance to health care systems in reliably red rural areas. In an interview, North Carolina Medicaid Director Jay Ludlam  , for instance, pointed out that rural residents make up twice as big a share of the state’s Medicaid expansion population as they do of the overall population. Experts say that dynamic, which is evident in other states too, is primarily because workers in rural places are less likely to receive health insurance from their employers. Through the expansion, Ludlam said, “We have seen individuals get medicines for heart disease, diabetes, for treatment of seizures – chronic diseases that would go otherwise untreated.” If people lose that coverage, he continued, “initially what you would start to see is an uptick in emergency room visits, which is an incredibly expensive way to provide health care,” with “eventually some of those chronic diseases beginning to have a really adverse impact on the health of many people.” The best example of how all these pressures converge may be Speaker Johnson’s own state of Louisiana. As a lower-income, heavily rural state, Louisiana has been among the greatest beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion. The state expanded eligibility under Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in 2016 and his Republican successor, Gov. Jeff Landry, has not sought to repeal it. According to Kaiser, Louisiana has signed up nearly 800,000 people for the expansion, more than all but four other (and much larger) states. Johnson and fellow Louisiana GOP Reps. Julia Letlow, Clay Higgins and Steve Scalise each have more than 100,000 district residents receiving Medicaid through the expansion, which places all of them among the top eight of all House Republicans. Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, an advocacy group for low-income families, says the Medicaid expansion has also provided a financial lifeline for the state’s health care providers. While rural hospitals are struggling in many states, he notes, none have closed in Louisiana since the expansion. “If you drive around Louisiana,” he added, “you will see a lot of clinics … where they didn’t exist 10 to 15 years ago.” Revoking expansion funding, Moller said, “would be devastating for Louisiana’s budget, and it would seriously threaten health care access for the 1 in 3 Lousianians who depend on Medicaid.” Even people with private insurance or Medicare would be hurt, Moller added, if reduced Medicaid revenue forces hospitals and other providers to close, particularly in rural areas with fewer alternatives. That could be a common problem in many states, Orris said. “Pulling as much money out of the health care system as they are talking about … will hurt everyone in a community,” she said. If congressional Republicans can’t find the votes to directly reverse the expansion, they have signaled they may seek to truncate it by imposing a work requirement on Medicaid recipients. (Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, has said he will not support cuts in benefits, but would back a work requirement.) Surveys have found about two-thirds of people on Medicaid already work full- or part-time, and almost all the rest would likely be exempt from any mandate because of factors such as a disability or caring for a family member. But when Arkansas and New Hampshire experimented with work requirements in Trump’s first term, large numbers of people were still thrown off the program for failing to meet the paperwork requirements to document their work. The same could happen with a federal mandate. It would be a bitter irony if a work requirement becomes a vehicle to erase the Medicaid expansion’s historic gains in extending health coverage to the working poor – in red places as well as blue.",,0.19794167578220367
"The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear arguments in a case against the US Postal Service filed by a Texas woman who claims her carrier declined to deliver the mail to her rental properties because she is Black. Lebene Konan, a realtor and licensed insurance agent, alleged that the post office that covers two rental properties she owns in suburban Dallas changed the lock on her post office box and then declined to deliver the mail to the property for two to three months. Konan claimed that happened because the carrier and postmaster did not “like the idea that a Black person” owned them. A 1946 law generally allows people to sue the federal government for damages if employees cause injury or property loss through their negligence. But the law includes a number of exceptions, including for any claim raising from the “loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.” The question for the high court, then, is whether the exception applies to Konan’s situation. A federal district court in Texas granted the government’s request to dismiss the case, because of the exception. But the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The Biden administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in September, and the Trump administration has continued to defend against the suit. In the fiscal year that ended in 2023, the US Postal Service delivered more than 116 billion pieces of mail to more than 166 million delivery points across the nation, the government noted. If courts embraced Konan’s position, the government said, it could open the USPS up to a flood of lawsuits. “Under the logic of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, any person whose mail is lost or misdelivered could bring a federal tort suit – and potentially proceed to burdensome discovery – so long as she alleges that a USPS employee acted intentionally,” the government told the high court in its appeal. The Supreme Court is likely to hear arguments in the fall and hand down a decision next year. SCOTUS declines to revive gun ban for 18-year-olds Also Monday, the court also declined to review an appeals court ruling that found Minnesota’s ban on people under 21 carrying handguns violated the Second Amendment. The decision means that ban will remain blocked. A three-judge panel of the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals said in a unanimous decision that the 2003 law runs afoul of both the Second Amendment and the 14th Amendment, holding that the state could not lawfully prohibit individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 from obtaining a public carry permit simply because they are not yet 21. Minnesota appealed that decision in January, arguing that the appeals court failed to take into account a new Supreme Court decision from last year that softened the historical standard courts must consider when weighing whether gun regulations are constitutional. Related article
      Takeaways from the Supreme Court’s decision upholding the domestic violence gun ban More than 30 states and the District of Columbia have similar regulations. Another appeals court, the 5th Circuit, ruled earlier this year that a law banning the sale of handguns to 18- to 20-year-olds is also unconstitutional. The question of how far governments may go in regulating guns for those under 21 has been caught up in a broader debate about history that was created by a landmark 2022 decision from the Supreme Court that made it easier for Americans to carry guns in public. That decision required courts to find analogous gun regulations in history before ruling they were consistent with the Second Amendment. In the case of Minnesota’s law, the 8th Circuit ruled that there was no adequate historical analogue to the state’s ban. But a subsequent Supreme Court decision last year appeared to alter the analysis lower courts must make when weighing the constitutionality of gun laws. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns. A majority of justices said courts need not find the exact same regulation in the historical record but rather whether the new law is “relevantly similar” to laws that “our tradition is understood to permit.”",,0.4345764219760895
"The saga of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has become about more than one undocumented migrant’s plight in a Salvadoran jail and is now one of those rare cases that resonate in history and dictate the character of America itself. The deported Maryland resident’s fate is turning into a defining test of Donald Trump’s mass expulsion program and of Democrats’ ability to frame an opposing argument on the politically tricky issue of immigration, which normally favors the president and his party. The Abrego Garcia case and related matters could be the catalyst of a constitutional collision between an administration that brooks no restraints on its power and the authority of the judiciary to check an unfettered president. The ultimate outcome of this critical legal battle could hinge on whether the conservative Supreme Court majority is willing to risk a showdown with the president, which it has seemed keen to avoid. The administration admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was deported because of an administrative error, ignoring a judge’s ruling that he couldn’t be sent back to his native El Salvador, where his life could be in danger. But officials are refusing to return Abrego Garcia to the US, arguing they lack power to force El Salvador to do so. Officials are also choosing to interpret the Supreme Court’s ruling that the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return as a unanimous endorsement of the administration’s position. They argue that because Abrego Garcia is in the custody of a foreign government, they have no power to return him. The White House insists Abrego Garcia is a terrorist; a member of the notorious MS-13 gang, who will never be brought back to the US. But it has failed to produce definitive evidence to prove these claims. It has instead been maligning Abrego Garcia’s character by highlighting a domestic dispute with his US-born wife and a claim he was involved in human trafficking. But Abrego Garcia was not prosecuted in either case, and his wife has dismissed the allegations against him. ‘A lawless president’ Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen visited El Salvador last week. Abrego Garcia was brought out of custody to meet him, wearing civilian clothes, in a photo op apparently staged by the Trump-allied government to embarrass the visiting Democrat. “The subject at hand is that he and his administration are defying a court order to give Abrego Garcia his due process rights,” Van Hollen told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “They need to put up or shut up in the courts.” The senator argued the case proved America has a “lawless president who is ignoring the order of the Supreme Court of the United States to facilitate his return.” Democrats, hurt by former President Joe Biden’s long refusal to admit a crisis at the southern border, have recently struggled to handle immigration politics. And the Trump administration has sought to exploit the Abrego Garcia matter to force his defenders to line up against its hardline stance, which it believes is politically beneficial. But Van Hollen said the issues go far beyond one individual’s plight and get to the fundamental question of presidential power, where Trump is pushing and potentially exceeding the legal limits on issues beyond immigration. Van Hollen argued the president is using the scourge of gang violence to justify bypassing legal safeguards. Asked by Bash whether he would be OK if Abrego Garcia was eventually deported, given his undocumented status, Van Hollen replied: “I’m OK with whatever the law dictates.” Van Hollen has been heatedly attacked by Trump and the White House over his visit. The president called him a “fool,” and the case has prompted some Democrats, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, to suggest the party would be better off hammering Trump on the economy, an issue that may matter more to voters. But Van Hollen defended his stance. He told CNN’s Bash, “I don’t think it’s ever wrong to fight for the constitutional rights of one person, because if we give up on one person’s rights, we threaten everybody’s rights.” The Trump administration’s border czar, Tom Homan, however, refused to give any ground on the case — which has become an acid test of the administration’s broader immigration approach. After all, if Abrego Garcia is returned, questions will be raised about the status of hundreds of other undocumented migrants the administration claims are terrorists and gang members who were shipped to a notorious prison in El Salvador. And the Trump administration would be tacitly admitting the courts had jurisdiction over its conduct. “We removed a public safety threat, a national security threat, a violent gang member from the United States,” Homan said Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.” “ICE intelligence says he’s an MS-13 gang member. Confidential information says he’s an MS-13 gang member. The country of El Salvador says he’s an MS-13 gang member. I think he’s exactly where he should be.” A constitutional clash is brewing that the Supreme Court may want to avoid The Trump administration’s mass deportation program — a centerpiece of the president’s 2024 election campaign — is now embroiled in multiple legal challenges. It seems inevitable that the policies, which have already landed before the Supreme Court,  will return there for final adjudication in a moment of historic importance. In the early hours of Saturday, for instance, a majority on the high court temporarily blocked the administration from deporting a group of immigrants in Texas under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. Justice Samuel Alito, who dissented along with his fellow conservative Clarence Thomas, slammed the decision as “unprecedented and legally questionable.” The court is expected to issue a more formal ruling on whether the White House can go ahead in the coming days. The use of the Alien Enemies Act is controversial for several reasons. First, it’s one of the most notorious laws in US history and was the basis for the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II, which is now regarded as a dark chapter in US history. Second, the act is designed to be used in time of war to detain and deport civilians. Despite Trump’s claim that the US is subject to a migrant invasion, the US is not in a state of war. In another case related to the act, US District Judge James Boasberg ruled Wednesday that the administration showed “willful disregard” for his mid-March order halting deportation flights amid a dispute over the legality of the removals. He was the first judge to find “probable cause exists” to hold administration officials in criminal contempt. The key concerns about the use of the Alien Enemies Act come down to the lack of opportunities for detainees to challenge the action against them in court. This impression — that basic constitutional rights and legal procedures that underpin the republic are being infringed — is crystalized by the Abrego Garcia case and is why Trump opponents like Van Hollen regard it as so critical. In a key twist in the drama last week, a federal appeals court knocked back the administration’s request to overrule a Maryland federal judge, Paula Xinis, in the Abrego Garcia case. Xinis is growing increasingly frustrated with the administration’s delaying tactics and defiance after she ordered it to follow the instructions of the Supreme Court and “facilitate” his return. In a ruling Thursday, the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit denied the government’s emergency motion to stay Xinis’ order pending appeal. Writing for the appeals court, Judge Harvie Wilkinson said the administration’s assertion of “a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process” should be “shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.” Wilkinson, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, warned of a situation in which two branches of government were “grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.” “If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” Wilkinson asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies?” The ruling encapsulated this perilous moment in American history, and the question of whether the judiciary — one of the last effective checks on Trump’s power — will constrain or enable a president who sees few limits on his authority.",,0.3488209843635559
"President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee collected a staggering $239 million for the festivities surrounding his swearing-in this year — with some of the nation’s wealthiest people and biggest companies writing large checks as they sought to ingratiate themselves with the Republican ahead of his return to the White House. The total haul reported Sunday by the committee swamped the then-record $107 million Trump raised for his first inauguration in 2017 and is almost four times the nearly $62 million collected by his immediate predecessor, Joe Biden, for his pared-down swearing-in during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. The single-largest donor to Trump’s committee was Colorado-based poultry company Pilgrim’s Pride, which contributed $5 million, Sunday night’s filing with the Federal Election Commission shows. Cryptocurrency firm Ripple Labs gave nearly $4.9 million, while another crypto interest, trading app Robinhood, donated $2 million. The report shows that some of the most generous givers have secured roles in the Trump administration, including Arkansas financier Warren Stephens, Trump’s pick to serve as US ambassador to the United Kingdom. He donated $4 million, according to the filing. Jared Isaacman, a billionaire businessman awaiting Senate confirmation to head NASA, gave $2 million — as did Melissa Argyros, Trump’s pick as US envoy to Latvia. Linda McMahon, who serves as Trump’s education secretary, donated $1 million. His Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, donated $250,000. Inaugural committees are barred from accepting foreign contributions, but there are no legal limits on the size of donations that these nonprofit committees can receive. In the run-up to the event, major corporations announced they were showering the committee with seven-figure checks. And the heads of some of this year’s big inaugural corporate donors — including Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — scored prime seats at Trump’s January 20 swearing-in inside the Capitol Rotunda. Each company donated $1 million to the committee. “It’s not actually a good thing to see that number go up,” Max Stier, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, said of the increasingly eye-popping sums associated with inaugurations. “It’s an indication of a mechanism for moneyed interest to direct cash to a newly elected president to curry favor.” The Trump Vance Inaugural Committee reported taking in nearly $245.3 million and refunding a little more than $6 million in donations. In all, about 60% of the committee’s money came from more than 130 seven-figure donations, underscoring the outsize role of deep-pocketed interests in underwriting the glitzy events that swirl around inaugurations. Sunday marked 90 days since the inauguration, the legal deadline for the inaugural committee to disclose its donations of $200 or more to federal regulators. But its report to the Federal Election Commission offers only a partial picture because it does not have to detail how it spent the money or what it intends to do with any leftover contributions. An inaugural committee spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry Sunday about the spending and the size of leftover contributions. A person close to Trump’s fundraising previously indicated that excess donations are expected to be directed toward Trump’s presidential library, which he has begun to collect sums for. For instance, the terms of a defamation settlement that Trump reached late last year with ABC News directed $15 million to a “presidential foundation and museum.” Other notable figures who made personal $1 million donations to the Trump committee included OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, hedge fund honcho Paul Singer and Miriam Adelson, a longtime Trump political benefactor and the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Some of the inaugural donors revealed Sunday have interests before the government, including crypto businesses that have sought relief from Biden-era regulation of their industry and firms such as US Steel, which is waiting action by the Trump administration on potential acquisition by the Japanese company Nippon Steel. It gave a little more than $100,000. The chipmaker Nvidia, hit with export restrictions to China amid an escalating trade war, gave $1 million. Steve Kerrigan, who oversaw both of President Barack Obama’s inaugural committees and helped produced Biden’s 2021 event, told CNN the kind of money Trump has raised far exceeds what’s needed to underwrite inaugural events. Records show the committee for Obama’s first inauguration collected roughly $54 million — money that Kerrigan said adequately covered the costs of “the biggest planned political event in US history.” Obama’s first inaugural included 10 official balls, an expanded parade and a star-studded concert at the Lincoln Memorial. Trump’s second inauguration featured three official balls. Other Trump events included an inauguration-eve rally at an arena in Washington and a celebration, complete with fireworks, at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia. Kerrigan and watchdog groups, such as liberal-leaning Public Citizen, have called for federal legislation to put some guardrails on fundraising and impose greater disclosure for inaugural spending. “I know it’s not a public fund, but the public have a right to know how these dollars are spent,” said Kerrigan, who now chairs the Massachusetts Democratic Party. A bill introduced this year by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, would require detailed disclosure of who received payments from inaugural funds, ban the personal use of inaugural donations, and require that any leftover money go to charities recognized by the IRS. Previous efforts to change the law governing inaugural fund disclosure have failed. The spending by Trump’s first inaugural committee sparked an investigation by the Washington, DC, attorney general. It resulted in a $750,000 settlement paid by the Trump Organization and the inaugural committee over allegations that the committee had overpaid for event space at the downtown Washington hotel then owned by Trump’s company. The Trump entities denied wrongdoing and described the settlement as necessary to avoid a costly trial.",,0.2963305711746216
"Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who recently met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, slammed the Trump administration for its handling of the Maryland man’s mistaken deportation, telling CNN it poses a threat to “the constitutional rights of everybody in America.” Van Hollen, in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN, argued Abrego Garcia’s due process rights are being ignored as he remains in El Salvador after being mistakenly deported. “If we deny the constitutional rights of this one man, it threatens the constitutional rights of everybody in America,” the Maryland Democrat told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Van Hollen traveled last week to El Salvador, where he was first denied a meeting with Abrego Garcia. The senator was ultimately allowed to meet Thursday evening with the Maryland father, who described being “traumatized” at El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison, according to Van Hollen. In a news conference Friday upon his return to the US, Van Hollen said that Abrego Garcia was moved from the maximum-security prison into another facility, where “conditions are better.” Related article
      Sen. Chris Van Hollen says Abrego Garcia described being ‘traumatized’ at CECOT, has been moved to different detention center Though the White House has admitted that Abrego Garcia — an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador whom a judge ordered in 2019 could not be removed to his home country over fear of persecution — was mistakenly deported last month, President Donald Trump’s administration and the El Salvadoran government have said he will not be returned to the US. When asked by Bash whether Van Hollen would be OK with Abrego Garcia’s deportation if it goes through due process, the senator said: “I’m OK with whatever the rule of law dictates.” Van Hollen also brushed off criticism, including from California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who denounced the Trump administration’s actions but also suggested that Democrats should focus on a more viable issue, such as tariffs and the economy. “I don’t think it’s ever wrong to fight for the constitutional rights of one person, because if we give up on one person’s rights, we threaten everybody’s rights,” Van Hollen said, adding, “Anyone who is not prepared to stand up and fight for the Constitution doesn’t deserve to lead.” The Trump administration is embroiled in a legal back-and-forth over Abrego Garcia’s deportation and has remained defiant that it will not bring back the deported man. The senator said the Trump administration is not complying with court orders, alleging the White House hasn’t made efforts to facilitate his return. “Facilitate does not mean you do nothing,” Van Hollen told Bash, referring to the Supreme Court’s ruling that ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia but stopped short of mandating it.

      Trump admin continues releasing information to paint Abrego Garcia as violent gang member as outcry against deportation grows Van Hollen shared that during his trip, employees of the US Embassy in the capital of San Salvador said they have not received “any direction from the Trump administration to help facilitate his release.” The White House has also attempted to paint Abrego Garcia as a violent and dangerous criminal, alleging that he is a member of the MS-13 gang. Abrego Garcia’s family and lawyers have denied he’s a gang member. Asked by Bash whether Van Hollen asked Abrego Garcia whether he has or previously had any ties to MS-13, the senator said he did not “because I know what his answer is.” “What he told me was he was sad and traumatized that he was being in prison because he has committed no crimes,” Van Hollen added. The Maryland senator also stressed that the Trump administration has not provided any evidence of Abrego Garcia’s alleged gang ties in court and said it is using the claims to “change the subject.” “What Donald Trump is trying to do here is change the subject,” Van Hollen said. “The subject at hand is that he and his administration are defying a court order to give Abrego Garcia his due process rights.” This story has been updated with additional information.",,0.349031001329422
"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed plans about a military operation against the Houthis in Yemen on a second Signal group chat, this one on his personal phone and including his wife, lawyer and brother, three people familiar with the chat told CNN. The chat was set up during Hegseth’s tumultuous confirmation hearing process as a way for his closest allies to strategize, two of the people familiar with the matter said. But Hegseth continued using the chat, which had more than a dozen people in it, to communicate after he was confirmed, the people said. The revelation comes as some of Hegseth’s closest advisers have begun sounding the alarm about the secretary’s judgment, including his former press secretary, John Ullyot, and three former senior officials Hegseth fired last week — his top adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick, and Colin Carroll, who served as chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense. Related live-story
      Trump’s presidency: Immigration crackdown draws legal battles “It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership,” Ullyot said in a statement obtained by CNN. Ullyot also wrote a scathing op-ed about Hegseth for Politico on Sunday. The second Signal chat is in addition to the one Hegseth used to communicate with Cabinet officials last month about military plans. That chat is under investigation by the Defense Department’s acting inspector general. Similar to the first Signal chat, which was revealed publicly by The Atlantic after its editor was mistakenly included by national security adviser Mike Waltz, the military plans Hegseth shared in the second chat were about strikes against the Houthis, the people said. Hegseth’s brother Phil, as well as his lawyer Tim Parlatore, both have jobs at the Department of Defense. But his wife, Jennifer, does not, despite Hegseth regularly including her during the beginning of his tenure in meetings with foreign leaders. It is not clear whether everyone in the second Signal chat has a security clearance. A spokesperson for the Pentagon, Sean Parnell, said in a tweet Sunday night that “there was no classified information in any Signal chat.” Following the release of the report, the Pentagon’s top official took to X on Sunday evening to rail against Democrats, replying to a tweet from the Democratic National Committee calling for Hegseth’s ousting. In the first public response since the news broke, Hegseth replied via his personal X account: “Your agenda is illegals, trans & DEI — all of which are no longer allowed” at the Defense Department. On Monday morning, Hegseth attacked leakers and slammed the media. “Time and time again, as they pedal those lies no one ever calls them on it. This is what the media does. They take anonymous sources, disgruntled former employees and they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations,” Hegseth said at the White House Easter Egg Roll. At the same event, President Donald Trump denied that the Pentagon has become dysfunctional with Hegseth at the helm. “There’s no dysfunction at all. Ask the Houthis how much dysfunction they have,” Trump said in response to a question from CNN. “Pete’s doing a great job. Everybody’s happy with him,” Trump continued. “It’s just fake news. They just make up stories. I guess it’s — sounds like disgruntled employees. He was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people, and that’s what he’s doing. You don’t always have friends when you do that.” The New York Times was first to report on the second Signal chat. Sustained turmoil at the Pentagon News of the second chat follows days of turmoil at the Defense Department, after Hegseth fired Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll and reassigned his chief of staff, Joe Kasper. Last week, Pentagon spokespeople said the chaos had resulted from a leak investigation. But sources told CNN the firings are just one symptom of the dysfunction that has enveloped Hegseth’s office over the last five weeks, which included sustained infighting between Kasper, Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll. Kasper resigned from his role last week, though he may still be reassigned elsewhere in the Pentagon. He did not respond to requests for comment. A series of leaks about military planning for the Panama Canal and the Middle East, about a possible consolidation of the combatant commands, and about a classified China briefing for Elon Musk at the Pentagon had deeply rattled Hegseth by mid-March, sources told CNN. So he and Kasper launched a leak probe, complete with polygraph tests. Following the press reports — including one in The New York Times about the questionable success of a massive military campaign against the Houthis — Hegseth began to lash out and grew suspicious that senior military officials, as well as some of his closest advisers, were leaking to undermine him, the sources added. first signal chat
      White House closes case on Signal and stands by Waltz, with key questions still unanswered At one point, Hegseth even demanded an FBI probe into the leaks — which some of his aides advised against, sources said. There was already an active inspector general investigation focusing on Hegseth, and bringing in the FBI might only invite more scrutiny, those aides advised. Hegseth has also grown increasingly concerned about the inspector general investigation, the sources said. Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll expect to be interviewed as part of that probe, the sources added. Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll wrote Saturday in a joint statement that they are “incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended” and denied leaking information. “Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door. All three of us served our country honorably in uniform — for two of us, this included deployments to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, based on our collective service, we understand the importance of information security and worked every day to protect it,” they wrote. “At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks’ to begin with.” Ullyot, who served as Hegseth’s press secretary until earlier this month and resigned from the Defense Department entirely last week, also said Sunday it is “not true” that Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll were fired for leaking sensitive information. “While the Department said that it would conduct polygraph tests as part of the probe, not one of three has been given a lie detector test,” Ullyot said. “In fact, at least one of the three has told former colleagues straight out that investigators advised him he was about to be cleared officially of any wrongdoing. Unfortunately, Hegseth’s team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.” Related article
      For now, Pentagon and DHS won’t recommend that Trump invoke the Insurrection Act The turmoil has raised more concerns about Hegseth’s judgment and priorities among current and former officials, and comes as the Pentagon is executing a major military operation in the Middle East against the Houthis, moving assets to the region in the event of a wider war between Israel and Iran, and surging troops and equipment to the southern border. “Unfortunately, after a terrible month, the Pentagon focus is no longer on warfighting, but on endless drama,” Ullyot said. “Even strong backers of the secretary like me must admit: The last month has been a full-blown meltdown at the Pentagon — and it’s becoming a real problem for the administration,” he said. Hegseth, for his part, has still not weighed in on the firings or turmoil inside his office and has avoided situations over the last week in which he may have encountered the press. Reporters were invited to cover the defense secretary welcoming his French counterpart to the Pentagon on Thursday, but Hegseth failed to show up, sending an aide instead.

"When the newly elected Pope Francis returned to the front desk of his hotel in Rome to personally settle his bill a day after being introduced to cheering crowds in St. Peter’s Square in 2013, it was a first glimpse into the modesty that would come to define his papacy. But for one real estate developer turned reality television star observing developments from his penthouse in Manhattan, it was a sign of something else. “I don’t like seeing the Pope standing at the checkout counter (front desk) of a hotel in order to pay his bill,” Donald Trump, still years from mounting his first presidential bid, wrote on Twitter. “It’s not Pope-like!” There was little in common between now-President Trump and Pope Francis, who died Monday at 88. The two men sparred from afar on issues of immigration and the environment, adopted divergent approaches to the sumptuous trappings of their respective offices, and lived vastly different kinds of lives. “That’s why I’ll never be Pope!” Trump responded to a commenter on his post in 2013, who observed “the difference between the Pope and you is the Pope doesn’t have to constantly brag how great he is.” Yet for all the obvious differences, there was some overlap in how Francis and Trump arrived at their positions, and how they viewed their roles. Each was elected as an outsider and brought to their office a pledge to represent society’s forgotten: for Trump, the American workers who he said Washington passed over in an era of globalization; and for Francis, the poor and marginalized often left to the side of a fast-changing world. Both also sought dramatic changes to the institutions they ran: the sprawling federal government for Trump, and the billion-person strong Catholic Church for Francis. “He’s a very good man who loved the world. And he especially loved people that were having a hard time. And that’s good with me,” Trump said Monday after ordering flags on federal buildings lowered to half staff. Trump sent his love to American Catholics before quickly turning his remarks toward his strength among Catholic voters. “We love you all, we’re with you all. They were with me through the election, as you know, very strongly,” Trump said at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. “It’s just an honor to have the support of the Catholics. I feel very badly for them because they love the pope.” Trump’s 2017 visit to the Vatican When they met during Trump’s first term at the Vatican in 2017 — their only face-to-face encounter — Trump and Francis had already been tangling on the issue of immigration after Francis declared anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants was “not a Christian.” Trump had spent the 2016 presidential campaign vowing to construct a wall along the Southern US border to keep migrants out. Those differences were put aside during Trump’s visit, where he was accompanied by his wife Melania, who wore a traditional black veil. Both leaders appeared determined not to let their dispute spoil the encounter. And like most presidents before him, Trump emerged from his meeting with the pope appearing starstruck. “He is something, he’s really good. We had a fantastic meeting and we had a fantastic tour, it was really beautiful,” Trump said. Trump and the first lady had arrived to the Vatican about a half-hour earlier, his long motorcade and armored black SUV a stark contrast to the blue Ford Focus that Francis himself had arrived in to work that day. The meeting was not entirely devoid of politics. The pope presented Trump a copy of his influential encyclical document on preserving the environment, which was interpreted as an attempt by Francis to encourage Trump to adopt stronger efforts at combatting climate change. (It didn’t appear effective; Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord a few weeks later). Like many world leaders who watch Trump from afar, Francis found Trump easier to talk to than his harsh language on the campaign trail might have suggested. He lightened the mood when shaking Melania Trump’s hand, asking her in Italian, “Did you give him potica to eat?” — referring to the Slovenian dessert few could imagine the glamorous former model whipping up in the White House kitchen. Francis also handed Trump a medallion etched with the image of an olive tree, which he explained was “a symbol of peace.” “We can use peace,” Trump responded. As they parted ways, Trump told him: “I won’t forget what you said.” Influential meetings with Obama and Biden The three US presidents who met Francis all found themselves moved by the experience in different ways. President Barack Obama took the rare step of traveling to Joint Base Andrews to greet Francis at the start of the pope’s blockbuster visit to the United States in 2015. Later, the pope led a short parade in his open-air popemobile around the South Lawn, which was crowded with thousands who had come to witness a rare papal visit to the White House, some carrying babies for the pope to kiss. The cultural moment couldn’t be denied several months later on Halloween, when the child of an administration official arrived to the annual White House trick-or-treating event dressed as the pontiff, complete with a tiny white car. It was on that visit that Francis met privately with members of then-Vice President Joe Biden’s family in the immediate aftermath of his son Beau Biden’s death from cancer. Counseling the Biden’s inside an airplane hanger at the Philadelphia International Airport, Francis “provided us with more comfort that even he, I think, will understand,” Biden would later recount. After he became president, Biden traveled to Rome amid a raging debate inside the US Catholic Church over whether he and other politicians who support abortion rights should receive communion. Afterward, Biden said Francis called him a “good Catholic” and that he should continue receiving the sacrament. Last year, as he was preparing to depart office under a cloud of disappointment following his exit from the 2024 race and his vice president’s loss to Trump, Biden had planned to visit Rome again to meet Francis. The trip was canceled amid wildfires in Los Angeles, but in his final days as president Biden awarded Francis the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Discord with the second Trump administration Trump and Francis would never meet again after their 2017 encounter. After Trump was elected to a second term, Francis took harsh aim at his administration’s plans for mass deportations, warning such a step would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity and “will end badly.” It was a remarkable rebuke, issued in a letter to US bishops. It appeared to take aim at Vice President JD Vance for his defense of deportations on theological grounds. “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,” the pope wrote, responding to Vance’s assertion that people should take care of their family, communities and country before expanding care to others. In some ways, the rupture appeared to reflect a growing rift between traditionalist American Catholics and the Vatican under Francis, which had sought to be more inclusive of same-sex couples, women and other groups. Still, the discord did not appear to seep into Vance’s meeting with Francis on Easter Sunday, just a day before he died. Vance appears to have been the last world leader Francis met before his death. He sat briefly with the pope in a reception room at the Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse where he has lived since his election in 2013. Vance, who has called himself a “baby Catholic” after converting to the faith as an adult, was on Vatican grounds on Sunday for less than 20 minutes, and the meeting hadn’t been confirmed ahead of time. During their short session, the pope gifted the vice president a tie, rosaries and three big chocolate Easter eggs for Vance’s three children. “I pray for you every day,” Vance could be heard telling the Pontiff as they sat together at the Vatican.

"The Supreme Court on Monday signaled it may uphold a task force that recommends which preventive health care services Obamacare requires to be covered at no-cost, with several conservative justices voicing skepticism about a challenge that is based on how members of the panel are appointed. Related article
      Trump is defending Obamacare at the Supreme Court. A win could boost RFK Jr.’s influence At stake is the ability of millions of Americans to access cost-free services under the Affordable Care Act such as cancer screenings, statins that help prevent cardiovascular disease, PrEP drugs that help prevent HIV infections, and counseling referrals for pregnant and postpartum women at increased risk of depression. The task force’s recommendations were challenged by a Texas business, Braidwood Management, that objected on religious grounds to covering certain preventive services, including the PrEP medications. Braidwood argued that because Congress demanded the task force’s work be “independent” that its members should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. And because of that, it said that recommendations from the panel since the health reform law’s enactment in March 2010 should be thrown out. But the argument that the board members must be appointed by the president drew skepticism from several key conservatives, most notably Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh said that members of the task force are removable at will by the secretary of Health and Human Services. Truly independent agencies, he noted, typically have legal protections that require a president to show cause before firing members of a board. “We usually don’t interpret statutes to create independent agencies without some indication that’s stronger than what we have here that this is really protected from presidential … removal,” Kavanaugh said. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, another conservative, seemed to agree – at one point describing the challengers’ position as “very maximalist.” Still, several justices left open the possibility that the court might send the case back to the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals to answer other questions, including which officials Congress thought would appoint the task force members. It was also unclear how the court will handle earlier recommendations of services that had been made by previously appointed task force members. Before 2023, the task force members were originally appointed by the director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of HHS. During the course of the litigation, then HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra “ratified” the earlier appointments. Braidwood argues that the original appointments were unconstitutional and that Becerra’s move didn’t retroactively address potential problems with the recommendations those earlier panels made. Fight about control of independent agencies The case, which is on appeal from the conservative 5th Circuit, created an unusual political dynamic. Though initially appealed by the Biden administration, President Donald Trump’s administration has defended the popular provision of Obamacare since taking power this year – despite the president’s years-long campaign to repeal the 2010 health care law. It also came amid a scorching and separate fight over Trump’s ability to control independent agencies like the National Labor Relations Board. In a series of decisions in recent years, the Supreme Court has tended to limit the independence of those agencies from the political whims of the White House. “We don’t go around just creating independent agencies,” quipped Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court’s liberal wing said. “More often we destroy independent agencies.” But at least some of the court’s conservatives, including Justice Samuel Alito, questioned  how much power the secretary of Health and Human Services has to veto the recommendations of the task force just because he can remove them at will. At one point, Alito described the arguments from Hashim Mooppan, an attorney for the Trump administration, as “jerry-built.” “If Congress really wanted these task force members to do the bidding of the secretary, isn’t that an incredibly odd way to go about conferring that authority?” Alito asked. After listening to nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments, Nicholas Bagley, a professor at University of Michigan Law School who specializes in administrative and health law, said the justices seemed to be learning towards the government’s arguments. “With oral argument wrapping up, it looks like the government is likely to win in Braidwood, saving the constitutionality of the preventive services mandate,” he posted on X, later telling CNN that “the government had a good day in court.” Those challenging the structure of the task force were represented by Jonathan Mitchell, a well-known conservative lawyer who has been involved in other culture war disputes in court, including a significant abortion case at the Supreme Court, and who represented Trump when he was a presidential candidate in a challenge to the state of Colorado’s attempt to remove him from the ballot. The challengers’ religious liberties claims were spun off into separate proceedings. The dispute in front of the court Monday focused on the Constitution’s appointments clause, which establishes the president and Senate’s role in appointing and confirming officials that wield significant government power. A majority of justices expressed “significant skepticism” about the Mitchell’s position, said Andrew Pincus, a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown who filed a brief supporting the government on behalf of the American Public Health Association. Several of the justices, Pincus said, expressed the view that there’s “plenty of room in the statute to conclude that the secretary of HHS has the power to control whether these recommendations are binding on private parties” through the power to appoint and remove the task force members and to determine whether their recommendations will be binding.",,0.23980441689491272

"The logos of Big Tech companies and key associations were featured prominently Monday at the White House Easter Egg Roll, offering an unprecedented scene and use of the grounds to promote private business. Children danced on the grass as a military band performed Martha and the Vandellas’ “Nowhere to Run, Nowhere to Hide” atop a stage emblazoned with eggs and rabbits sporting the YouTube logo. And dozens of attendees lined up to take a photo in Meta’s tent, which featured a White House backdrop and a locator icon in the style of Instagram. All money raised from the sponsorships will go toward the nonprofit White House Historical Association. But the sponsorship opportunities, which were first reported by CNN in March, have prompted concern from ethics and legal experts, as well as from White House officials on both sides of the aisle, because the solicitations run counter to long-established regulations prohibiting the use of public office for private gain. Those opportunities included “naming rights for key areas or elements” and “sponsor logos featured on event signage,” according to a document from an outside production company called Harbinger that was obtained by CNN. The sponsorships underscore the lengths to which businesses have sought to cultivate relationships with the Trump administration — even amid the uncertainty and upheaval of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. That was particularly poignant as a volunteer in a white apron facilitated a photo opportunity while a toddler and his parents rang a mock bell sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange, as the Dow tumbled more than 1,000 points. Also on Monday, families walked under an arch made of hundreds of fresh carrots featuring “International Fresh Produce Association” branding. A volunteer handed out Slinky toys in a “play garden” space provided by The Toy Association. A “reading nook” tent was set up with a couch and Amazon signage. Yet when the time came for first lady Melania Trump to read “Bunny with a Big Heart,” she was far from the branding and logos, at a different reading nook in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, decorated with florals and a pastel White House Easter Egg Roll sign. Private contributions covered activity booths, artists, music, vendors, staging, equipment and décor, said a source familiar with the planning who was granted anonymity to detail specifics of the funding mechanisms. Any excess funding raised, that source said, will go toward similar White House events, such as Halloween festivities and the Fourth of July.",,0.21059484779834747
"The United States has returned more than 1,400 looted artifacts worth $10 million to India as part of an ongoing initiative to repatriate stolen art from countries across South and Southeast Asia, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office announced Wednesday. The trafficked goods recovered include items that, until recently, were on view at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Among them is a sandstone sculpture of a celestial dancer that was smuggled from central India to London, before being illegally sold to one of the Met’s patrons and donated to the museum. The repatriations resulted from “several ongoing investigations” into looting networks, including those operated by convicted art traffickers Nancy Wiener and Subhash Kapoor, an American antiquities dealer who was sentenced to 10 years in jail for running a multimillion-dollar looting network through his New York gallery, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said in press release. Kapoor was sent to face charges in India’s Tamil Nadu state following his arrest in Germany in 2011. The DA’s office obtained an arrest warrant for him in 2012though he remains in custody in India, pending his extradition to the US. Related article
      Cambodia welcomes the Met’s repatriation of centuries-old statues looted during past turmoil “Today’s repatriation marks another victory in what has been a multiyear international investigation into antiquities trafficked by one of history’s most prolific offenders,” William Walker, the federal Homeland Security Investigation’s New York special agent in charge, said in a press statement. The items were formally returned at a ceremony at the Indian consulate in New York Wednesday. Since its creation over a decade ago, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Antiquities Trafficking Unit –– a task force of lawyers, investigators and art experts –– has recovered 5,800 antiquities valued at almost $460 million. The unit has also convicted 16 people of trafficking offenses and filed for the extradition of six others linked to stolen cultural property. In July, the US and India signed an agreement to protect cultural property by preventing illegal trades and streamlining the process of returning stolen antiquities back to India.",,0.25384756922721863
"In idyllic settings around India’s coastal southwestern state of Kerala, photographer Keerthana Kunnath has been capturing images of muscular women flexing their heroic forms. Amid foaming waves, palm fronds or rocky outcrops the women curl biceps, tense quads or exaggerate shoulders, exchanging gym clothes for a gauzy olive dress or feminine checkered bikini top and skirt. But in Kerala, where the London-based photographer is from, bodybuilding is still taboo for women, who are typically expected to adhere to traditional, feminine norms. After stumbling upon one competitor’s Instagram account, Kunnath became fascinated by the female bodybuilders who have dedicated their time to the sport and defied societal conventions — and often their family’s wishes, too. “Where we are, it’s not a very common thing,” she explained in a phone call to CNN. “I would barely call it a ‘community’ because it’s still fairly new, and there’s only a very handful of girls who are into it.” Across India, a growing number of female competitors in the sport have achieved professional status with its governing body, the International Fitness and Bodybuilding Federation — but only in recent years. Deepika Chowdury, a former molecular biologist, became the first Indian woman to do so in 2016. Related article
      What life is like in one of the most remote places on Earth Initially interested in researching the gender-neutral martial art Kalaripayattu, which originated in Kerala, Kunnath shifted her focus after finding that the women focused on bulking instead. The bodybuilders she photographed — part of her series “Not What You Saw” — didn’t know each other well, but were aware of one another through social media and competitions. “Every time I connected with each person, and I told them I’m going to photograph that person before you, they would be like, ‘Oh my god, I know her — her body is stunning. Her thighs are crazy,’” she said with a laugh. “It felt like mutual admiration between all of them.” Dedication to the sport For Bhumika Kumar, who is 22 years old and lives in the Kerala city of Kochi, training for bodybuilding competitions has fulfilled a lifelong desire to become an athlete — a dream she hadn’t been allowed to pursue as a child, she told CNN via WhatsApp. Now a gold-medalist in local competitions like Miss Kerala and Miss Ernakulam, she has transformed herself following what she described as an inactive childhood. “My parents wouldn’t let me go out and play with other kids. Hence, I was not a very physically active kid during my school days. I was always low in stamina and strength,” she wrote. As an adult, she found her gateway to exercise through workout videos on YouTube and joined a gym “after lots of fights with family,” she said. She felt drawn to competing professionally but also divided on whether to pursue it until a year ago. “I couldn’t stop thinking about stepping onstage,” she said. “Then I finally decided to go for it and met my coach.” Related article
      ‘This is all pink and attractive, but we are going to die’: Anastasia Samoylova on photographing Florida’s climate anxiety Kumar isn’t the only woman in the series whose relatives felt entitled to get involved with their personal choices. Kunnath spoke extensively with each of her subjects by phone before meeting them in person to better understand their journeys. “A lot of them had pressure from their family and extended relatives: ‘How are you letting your daughter go into this space where they’re working on their muscles? They’re showing off their bodies,’” she said, recalling the kinds of comments her subjects had heard. Heroic portraits Kerala’s female bodybuilders are entering a high-pressure, male-dominated sport requiring daily commitment under coaches primarily used to training men. One of Kunnath’s subjects, 25-year-old Sandra A S, has been training for four years and now coaches aspiring bodybuilders, too. She hopes to break barriers for women competitors by winning a qualification card to compete professionally on the international stage. As Kunnath visualized the series, she turned to the iconography of Indian goddesses that she encountered during childhood. “I still remember having these posters of goddesses in front of these serene backgrounds,” she recalled. Working with a local stylist, Elton John, Kunnath pursued non-sexualized, heroic portraits with muted pastels and flowing fabrics, departing from gym clothes or the punchy, colorful bathing suits and direct lighting of the bodybuilding stage. “They are these extremely muscular, strong, confident girls… but still, they still have this softness to them,” Kunnath said. The photographer found the more a bodybuilder bulks, the more she is treated as a “really strong, intimidating character,” but that’s not always the case. Since beginning the series, Kunnath has also made a point of supporting her subjects by attending their competitions and taking their professional headshots to a “thank you” for being part of the work. “They had to carve this space for themselves,” she said. “I feel like those stories should be celebrated.”",,0.29201823472976685
"In the depths of Covid, Aamir Khan tried walking away from it all. Acting, filmmaking; the business that made him a household name to millions in India and beyond. No more. The Bollywood megastar, one of India’s highest paid actors, was locked down in 2020 and feeling introspective. “I’d spent all my adult life in this magical world of cinema. And I was so lost in stories and characters and that whole journey that I realized I had not been there for my family,” Khan told CNN during a recent visit to London. “It was a major moment for me,” he said. “My three kids, two of them already adults, and I pretty much missed their childhoods. All of that really made me feel horrible about myself and how I’d conducted my life.” “I’m quite an extreme person,” he added, “so I was like, ‘OK, ‘I’m done with films now.’” Khan still had half a film left to shoot, which had been halted by the pandemic. He told no one of his plans beyond his family, which begs the question: if he kept it secret, did he really retire? “I did,” he insisted. “I used to go to work with my daughter — she runs a nonprofit company working in mental health … Really, I was having a great time.” Eventually his kids had a quiet word (“We can’t spend 24 hours a day with you, you need to get a life of your own,” as the actor tells it) pushing him back into the arms of Bollywood. And until recently, the rest of the world was none the wiser. So, though you might not have missed him, Aamir Khan has returned — only this time he’s making sure he’s home for supper. Khan is busy promoting “Lost Ladies” (“Laapataa Ladies”), which he produced. Directed by Kiran Rao, who is also Khan’s ex-wife, it tells the story of two veiled brides who accidentally go home with the wrong grooms as they travel back from their respective weddings. The light satire, playing on Netflix, is India’s official submission to the Academy Awards and BAFTAs. The movie features Nitanshi Goel and Pratibha Ranta as brides Phool and Jaya — one young and somewhat naïve, the other ambitious and independent. Phool becomes separated from husband Deepak (Sparsh Shrivastava). He in turn is distraught to learn the other bride Jaya has used the mix-up to flee her own husband, a sinister character who may have killed his first wife, and who refuses to let his second wife further her education. “The film organically spoke to so many issues that girls go through thanks to deeply entrenched patriarchy and gender roles and the lack of freedoms that women experience in so many parts of the world,” said director Rao. Khan brought the script to Rao, who set about injecting some laughs. “Humor is one thing that both of us really wanted to bring into the film. It really softens you, and (for) people who otherwise may not be of your point of view, it makes it easier for them to get it,” Khan said. (Using cinema to sway hearts and minds is a subject which Khan returns to often.) Khan and Rao met on the set of Oscar-nominee “Lagaan” (2001) and were married for 15 years, divorcing in 2021. Clearly still on good terms, theirs is a collaboration that has endured. “I think it starts with the fact that we both really enjoy each other’s minds,” said Rao. They’re presenting a united front in the lead up to the Oscars, where they hope to break a notable winless streak for the movie-mad nation. India has never been recognized for Best International Feature Film (previously Best Foreign Language Film), and only won its first Academy Award in 2023, when “RRR” walked away with Best Original Song. Khan is lending considerable clout to the campaign, marking a rare occasion he enters awards season mode. The actor is known for steering clear of such endeavors at home (“You’ll have to come to one of the Indian awards to understand that better,” he quipped) and admits he doesn’t “usually take awards that seriously.” But the Oscars offer something different: “It really opens up many windows for your film … I think as creative people, we really want more and more people to experience what we’ve done.” Kapadia won the Grand Prix at Cannes 2024 for her film about three women and their uneasy relationships with men and the city they call home.

      ‘All We Imagine As Light’: Payal Kapadia on her love letter to Mumbai and its women The elephant in the room is that more than one film from the subcontinent is eyeing up awards this season. Cannes Grand Prix-winner “All We Imagine as Light” by independent film director Payal Kapadia had been viewed as the lead candidate for Best International Film at the Oscars by some members of the Hollywood commentariat, only for the Film Federation of India (FFI) to choose otherwise. The ensuing bruhaha was only fueled by reported comments from the jury head that Kapadia’s felt like a “European film taking place in India, not an Indian film taking place in India.” But that film can always be submitted for other categories, and not all awards operate by the same submission rules as the Academy. “It’s a really interesting and exciting moment in Indian cinema when we see two women (making) films that speak about women’s journeys and struggles,” commented Rao. “In fact, both films actually address sisterhood and solidarity among women — and I think that really deserves celebration.” “There’s much more space for all of us, rather than to pit anyone against the other,” she added. Three Khans, one screen Khan’s brief hiatus has prompted new priorities. The actor says he wants to produce more in the next decade, becoming “a platform for young talent.” That doesn’t mean nurturing the next generation of stars, he clarifies. After more than 40 years in the game , he’s still not sure what stardom is. “We can’t place our finger on it,” said the actor. “Why do people love me and Salman (Khan) and Shah Rukh (Khan)? Why not someone else? What’s is that we have? I have no idea.” The trio known as the Three Khans have dominated Bollywood for 30 years. And Aamir has an update: the three are finally ready to share a screen. “Last year we were sitting together and I said, ‘Listen, before we all retire, we have to do one film together otherwise audiences will be really upset with us,’” Khan shared. “All three of us are looking forward to that,” he added. “All three of us have the responsibility of looking out for this one script that all of us can star in. I’m hoping it happens sometime soon.” If it does, the movie would be a once-in-a-generation event for Hindi cinema, and a boost for Khan. While Salman and Shah Rukh starred in 2023 action hits “Pathaan” and “Tiger 3,” Aamir’s latest, 2022’s big-budget “Forrest Gump” remake “Laal Singh Chaddha” faltered with audiences, and the actor hasn’t had a hit since 2016 sensation “Dangal” — the first non-English language film to earn more than $300 million at the global box office. (Not that a hit couldn’t necessarily come sooner — Khan has half a dozen films in various stages of production.) Khan has weathered rough patches before. After his 1988 breakthrough “Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak” “I had a string of flops,” he recalled. “I was being called a one film wonder — and rightly so, I was doing awful work.” In retrospect, those flops — eight or nine of them, he estimates — were the learning curve he needed. “I realized the hard way that filmmaking is one person’s vision, and that one person is the director,” he explained. “Which director you work with will really determine where your film ends up.” “I told myself that unless the script, the director and the producer are something I have complete trust in, I’m not going to do a film ever again — even if that means the end of my career. And my career almost ended as a result of that,” he added. Yes, Khan agrees a movie star can grab a film by the scruff of its neck, “But why would you want to do that?” he said, looking bemused. “I don’t want to be in a film that’s not appreciated … Also, I don’t like people praising me more than the film. When I’m in a film and someone says, ‘Oh, you were fantastic,’ and he doesn’t talk about the film, I’m like, ‘So the film didn’t work for him.’ For me, the film is most important. I come in much later.” A leading man under the spotlight When Khan speaks, people listen. This fact has become a double-edged sword for the actor. Leveraging his leading man status to advocate for various social causes has come with inevitable detractors. “It’s a tough one,” Khan said, of the responsibilities of using his voice. “I’ve been learning that sometimes you need to speak, and sometimes you don’t.” The actor says he tries to stay away from the “cacophony” of social media, “where almost anything that you say could be offensive to somebody.” “Experience has taught me that it’s much better to communicate through a film,” Khan added. “What I want to convey, I can convey through my stories.” What message to place inside the empathy machine of cinema has become a thorny issue in India. The power of Hindi cinema to sway public opinion has been in the spotlight, with some arguing Bollywood has “veered toward the right” during the rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Though their directors have denied it was their intention, popular films like “The Kerala Story” (2023) and “The Kashmir Files” (2022) have been criticized for perceived Islamophobia. Khan, a Muslim, who has played Hindus and Sikhs on screen, is a prominent avatar for a religiously pluralistic India. It was recently the 25th anniversary of “Sarfarosh” (1999) a beloved crime thriller which put the subject in the spotlight. Khan played Ajay, a Hindu police assistant commissioner in Mumbai charged with uncovering a gun-running operation designed to provoke civil unrest in India. Assisting him is steadfast officer Salim, played by Mukesh Rishi, whose allegiances are doubted because of his Muslim faith. Their fractious relationship comes to a head when Salim confronts Ajay, telling him, “Don’t you ever tell any Salim that this country isn’t his.” “It is still very relevant,” Khan reflected. “I thought ‘Sarfarosh’ was a really lovely script, and I think it was saying such important things — and saying it with so much love and sincerity that it really connected across the board in India.” “You want society to be inclusive. You don’t want any one section of society to feel insecure or worried, irrespective of where you are in the world, irrespective of which culture you’re talking about,” he added. Khan is a great believer that what happens in the movie theater doesn’t stay in the movie theater. “Creative people, their fundamental responsibility is to entertain,” he said, “but I don’t think that it ends there for me.” “You can also provoke (an audience). You can make them think. You can shed light on certain things,” he added. “It’s the creative people in society — the poets, the writers, the performing artists, dancers, painters — who really build the social fabric of any society. What I am today is largely a result of the effects of songs, paintings, poems, books, stories, films. All of that has affected me in some way or the other, and it’s made me who I am.” It’s a message anyone in the arts can get behind, including, he’ll hope, the Academy. Could “Lost Ladies” go all the way? Competition is stiff, but rule out a good awards season narrative at your peril. However, as Khan has come to appreciate, there’s more to life than awards and films. “It’s been an interesting journey these last three years, where I’ve come full circle. But now I’m in a much happier space — and I’m glad I didn’t quit.” “Lost Ladies” (“Laapataa Ladies”) is available to stream on Netflix.",,0.295282244682312
"The dusty highway leading to Sidhpur, in western India’s Gujarat state, winds through arid landscapes past roadside eateries and herds of lumbering camel, offering little hint of what the historic town holds. In the heart of Sidhpur lies a street lined with stately three- and four-story mansions, known as “havelis,” in a fading palette of rainbow pastel shades, from teal and baby pink to pistachio green. Known locally as Paris Galli, or Paris Street, it transports visitors to a European city with grand Neoclassical architecture and a harmonious melange of Art Deco, Baroque and hybrid Indian styles. Sidhpur is less than three hours’ drive from Gujarat’s capital Ahmedabad, but it remains under the radar of travelers and architecture enthusiasts. On the day of my visit, the neighborhood around Paris Galli appeared largely deserted, except for occasional passersby in the distinctive colored hijabs and gold and white caps worn by the Dawoodi Bohras, a Shia Muslim sect that first settled in this part of western India in the 11th century. The Bohras are a close-knit trading community that originated in Egypt and later traveled around North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia to trade in spices, gems and perfumes. The sect’s seat was later moved from Yemen to Sidhpur, where its followers showcased their prosperity and wealth by building hundreds of opulent residences in the first half of the 20th century. These housing clusters were called Bohrawads or Vohrawads, and the mansions’ owners tried to outdo one another with chandeliers, Belgian glass and antique furniture, or by hosting grand dinners. The community’s close trading connections with Europe may have influenced its architectural sensibilities. The region’s maharaja at the time, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, was also known to be fond of European architecture. He laid out strict planning rules, inspired by Scottish urban planner Patrick Geddes (who lived in India between 1914 and 1924), that resulted in strikingly uniform streetscapes, according to Sidhpur-born architect Zoyab A. Kadi. “The Bohras extended their help to other communities during a famine in the early 1900s, and (in return) the Maharaja of Baroda gifted them a tract of land, as they were facing a housing shortage,” he said. “It was on this land that they started building these magnificent edifices, which had to adhere to strict town planning rules.” Found mostly in Najampura district, where Paris Galli is located, the long, narrow mansions are made mainly of wood (the material’s flexibility is an advantage in earthquake-prone regions) in addition to plaster and brick. The designs feature gabled roofs, pilasters and columns, carved doors and ornate overhanging “jharokha” windows that protrude from the front of each mansion. The main living floor is located above street level over a basement; stepped plinths, or “otlas,” act like porches and were traditionally used as social spaces; whimsical monograms, featuring family initials or surnames in English, are often displayed on the buildings’ facades. “The courtyard houses, built in rows or sequence, exhibit rhythm with diversity,” said Ahmedabad-based conservation architect, Ashish Trambadia, over the phone. “While each house has a unique color scheme, unique stucco art and grill work; the precise alignment of plinths, roof lines and floor lines gave the streets a unique character.” Unique design India-based photographer Sebastian Cortés documented the town and its people in his series “Sidhpur: Time Present Time Past.” The images present a certain melancholy, from the faded glory of the mansions’ interiors to the women pictured gazing out of windows as they carry out household chores. “I was inspired by the mercantile communities of India… who displayed their wealth most aesthetically,” said New York-born Cortés in a phone interview. “This was inverse colonialism: The Bohras traveled around the world to countries like Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Yemen and Ethiopia, and brought back various influences and then blended it with their own customs and traditions, using local artisans to create magic.” Kadi has also helped bring international attention to the houses by authoring three books about the town: “Sidhpur and Its Dawoodi Bohra Houses,” “The Vohrawaads of Sidhpur” and “The Birth and Death of a Style.” “At casual glance, the streetscape looks European, but if you look closely there’s the Gujarati tradition of using wood as a building material, and the capitals (crowns of columns or pilasters) are neither Corinthian or Doric but hybrid — a product of various influences,” said Kadi, who now runs an architectural firm in Chennai. “Many of the houses were designed to give women privacy, as most of the men were abroad working hard and making money. (The homes are) also suited to the local weather, in terms of design and materials used.” The houses’ names, like Zainab Mansion and Kagalwala Manor, often reference the people who once lived there. There are showstoppers, like the Zaveri house (also known as the House with 365 Windows) which is now stained black with grit, its grand pilasters and geometric facade carvings in dire need of restoration, and the Teen Khuniya (or Three-Cornered House), with its distinctive triangular layout. According to local resident and tour guide Insiya Bangalorewalla, the homes were typically divided into five linear sections: the “dehli” (a service area), the “chowk” (a central courtyard kitchen and bathroom, open to the sky for light and, today, ventilation fitted with grilles), the outer “pursaal” (a multipurpose room for living and dining), the inner “pursaal” (the coolest room, used as a bedroom) and the orda (the best room in the house, well-furnished and used by the head of the family). “From the street you can’t see into the house thanks to a veil called the ‘furtaal,’ which protected the privacy of the women,” added Bangalorewalla on a tour through Najampura. The homes’ interiors were often a visual feast decorated with geometric tiles, friezes, Persian carpets, dark mahogany and rosewood furniture, painted Belgian mirrors, antique corner pieces, family memorabilia and a special marble recess meant for storing water (water has an important status in Islam, and is used to cleanse or purify the home). “Sidhpur’s architecture is very unique,” said Kadi, “as the buildings inspired by Western ideas and elements have been crafted by Hindu architects (but) are suited to an Islamic way of life.” Disappearing heritage Official town figures suggest that, in the 1970s, there were at least 1,400 of the mansions across Sidhpur. But after India gained independence from Britain in 1947, many of Sidhpur’s residents migrated overseas, or to larger Indian cities like Mumbai and Ahmedabad, leaving the houses’ upkeep to caretakers or relatives. Today, many are boarded up, lying forlorn and derelict or caught in legal tangles between former owners’ descendants; others have been demolished to make way for modern developments, with the antiques and timber sold off by owners. The official data suggests that fewer than 400 of Sidhpur’s havelis are currently inhabited. To help conserve the disappearing mansions, Kadi, along with others from Sidhpur, co-founded the Sidhpur Heritage Collective in 2024. The group is working to document the town’s architecture, as well as holding workshops and guided tours. “Unfortunately, there are no heritage laws in India that prevent demolition of (privately owned) houses,” said Kadi. “We also have no funds or body helping us in this project. Even converting these houses into homestays and Airbnbs has not yet taken off. “(Sidhpur) has a lot to offer besides just these mansions, from a rich food culture to temples and mosques. I can only hope that we manage to save the town’s architecture before it’s destroyed forever. This needs public will and funding.”",,0.2968297600746155
"Camera phones at the ready, around 700 guests hailing from across India and the world expected a visual spectacle on Saturday evening — and they weren’t disappointed. A hush descended as the doors opened to the Jio World Center in Mumbai, where legendary Indian fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee presented a star-studded 25th anniversary runway show for his namesake brand. The celebrated designer — known for his maximalist Indian style — has dressed some of the biggest names across Bollywood and Hollywood, including Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone, Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez. For his landmark show, the stars showed up to lend their support: Padukone opened proceedings in an all-white ensemble adorned with necklaces, including a crucifix from Mukherjee’s jewelry line. She later walked again with supermodel Christy Turlington as part of the grand finale. Over 150 looks were presented, including pants and skirts embroidered with gold threads, frilled head gear, stacked jewelry and tops with slogans such as “cat lady,” “table for one,” “where has love gone,” and “all dressed up nowhere to go.” Mukherjee explained in a phone interview that these pieces were intended to be satire on how technology is dehumanizing humans. “We seem to have forgotten how to establish human relationships,” he said. There were also trench coats, sweaters, shorts and shirts made in more conventionally western silhouettes. These marked a departure from Mukherjee’s usual festive and bridal wear, which are heavily inclined towards traditional Indian styles, such as saris, ghagra cholis and sherwanis. But with no shortage of drama, the new collection featured heavily embroidered jackets embellished with semi-precious stones, brocade dresses, ostrich leather jackets and skirts, and blouses with velvet appliqués overlaid with faux fur. Kolkata roots Born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Mukherjee is one the most sought-after Indian designers, both domestically and overseas. He has stores in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata, and also opened his first international outpost in New York in 2022. Mukherjee continues to recognize his West Bengal roots, transforming his latest runway into one inspired by his home city, which is renowned for its rich history, art and architecture and deep-seated culture of art and literature appreciation. Dressed in black, as per the dress code, guests including actors Alia Bhatt and Rani Mukherji and industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla admired and filmed the colonial pillars, stained glass windows and blue arched doors of an old, reimagined neighborhood of Kolkata. Mukherjee told CNN that Kolkata was his “ultimate and silent inspiration along with everyday life.” He described it as “a city of patina, where the grandest buildings lie crumbling to the reality of decay, where stories of the rambunctious red-light area of Sonagachi, the sinewy pimps of Kamathipura (and) the effervescence of marigolds in Mallick Ghat co-exist under the hypnotic and ever-watchful eyes of Goddess Kali.” The show opened with songs in Mukherjee’s mother tongue Bengali, that were composed, written and sung by famous Bengali musicians including Nobel Prize awardee Rabindranath Tagore. (Tagore was the first non-European writer and poet to win the award for literature in 1913.) “As a Bengali, I’ve had access to this excellent mixing of hedonism with the sophistication of culture. This is the environment I grew up in. It has shaped my consciousness,” Mukherjee said. Building ‘India’s first global luxury brand’ Looking to the future, Mukherjee said he plans to expand his company’s presence in the US by partnering with major retail outlets and introducing a line of fragrances and beauty products. He also plans to design more ready-to-wear collections and jewelry, while “adapting heritage practices dynamically to remain relevant for contemporary lifestyles,” according to a brand press release. “We have pressed reset,” he said, of his ambition to expand beyond the bridal wear that he’s become so famous for. “Most of the crafts we (Indians) consume are because of weddings,” he said. (India’s wedding industry is estimated at about $130 billion.) “But that will soon change forever.” While people have “used weddings to create dominance by spending money,” said Mukherjee, “now young people (would) rather spend money on experiences.” Mukherjee, dressed in jeans and a black top with Sabyasachi’s logo featuring a Royal Bengal Tiger, took a closing bow with Padukone and Turlington. A Bengali version of the hymn “We Shall Overcome” played as the crowd gave a standing ovation. Though, this one had different lyrics: “One day the light of the sun, one day the light of our dreams, one day the light of truth shall shine. Deep in our hearts, we hold the belief; the light of the truth will shine.” It’s a sentiment that perhaps best sums up Mukherjee’s heartfelt approach. “Humanity, after all, is the biggest luxury today,” he said.",,0.29034408926963806
"Travel can be tough for unmarried couples looking for a bit of privacy in India. Accommodations routinely decline to let this growing segment of the population share rooms — especially those looking to book a hotel in the city where they already reside. Which is why a change to a budget hospitality booking platform’s policy in a small Indian city has drawn much attention both in and outside the country. It all started in early January, when OYO Rooms issued “new check-in directives” for its partner accommodations in the northwestern city of Meerut, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Delhi, stating that hotels there could deny bookings from unmarried couples at their discretion. The move drew swift criticism online, as the brand has long presented itself as a safe haven for unmarried couples. “When it launched that was their whole tagline, ‘no questions asked,’ to the point that everyone knows that that’s what OYO is for: it’s not just a hotel chain but a hotel for couples looking for privacy,” a 25-year-old media professional who has booked with OYO in Delhi told CNN on the condition of anonymity. Unlike in many countries, where it’s common for unmarried couples to stay in a room together, Indian customs still heavily frown upon the practice. OYO, which launched in 2012, was one of the first platforms to offer a solution for this growing group of travelers, tagging hotels as “couple friendly” on its app and website. Other start-ups such as Stay Uncle, Brevistay and Nestaway have since followed in OYO’s footsteps and provide rooms by the hour and rental properties that assure safe access for unmarried couples.

      One of the world’s greatest religious spectacles is underway and the numbers are staggering Many view OYO’s u-turn, however small, as symbolic of the continuous clash between traditional Indian values and an evolving, modern society. “Commonly we think of privacy as the right to be let alone or without interference or intervention but in the Indian cultural context, that actually goes against our cultural orientation, which is predominantly collectivist,” said Shagufa Kapadia, a professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies and director of the Women’s Studies Research Center at India’s Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. OYO said that its decision, which is specific to Meerut, was a response to “feedback that OYO has received in the past from civil society groups” in the area. “While we respect individual freedoms and personal liberty, we also recognize our responsibility to listen to and work with civil society groups in the micro markets we operate in,” Pawas Sharma, OYO’s North India region head, said in a statement announcing the policy change. The family versus the couple An OYO ad released in 2024 plays on the company’s existing reputation as a platform that offers rooms to unmarried couples looking for privacy and intimacy. In the commercial, a married couple is seen telling their parents that they have booked an OYO room and that their family should accompany them to “have fun together,” which elicits shocked looks around the dinner table. The ad then cuts to the family at an OYO hotel with a voice-over: “This is not that OYO hotel.” Many social media users considered the video, along with the recent move in Meerut, as attempts by OYO to rebrand itself as family-friendly. According to Kapadia, the family unit has always been prioritized over the couple, and even after marriage the privacy granted to couples is “conditional.” OYO’s recent decision to allow hotels to turn away unmarried couples in Meerut can be seen as a way of appeasing the society in which they are operating, she added. Kapadia noted that religious and right-wing groups often harass establishments for doing things deemed harmful to Indian society, such as providing rooms to unmarried couples in smaller cities like Meerut, which is located in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP).

      The disputed region of India that bakes bread to rival France UP is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and is headed by Chief Minister Ajay Singh Bisht, who goes by the name Yogi Adityanth and routinely dresses in a saffron garment similar to those worn by Hindu saints. “Beyond civil society groups now it’s also the state which is interfering in private life, dawning a paternal character in an already patriarchal society that increasingly infantilizes its young people, especially women, as a means of control,” Kapadia said. CNN has contacted the district administration in Meerut for a response. Meanwhile, managers of the Meerut hotels impacted by the new check-in directives appear to have mixed views. “I have nothing to say about whether such a policy is good or bad. The only thing is that we don’t want any fingers pointed at us, we don’t want any organizations or community groups to come knocking at our doors asking why we are letting such couples in,” said the manager of one of 21 hotels listed on OYO in the city, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. Concern for LGBT Indians The owner of another hotel in Meerut, who did not wish to be named, told CNN that it was up to him who he would let stay at his hotel and unmarried couples were not welcome. “Absolutely not. We don’t allow it. We don’t want anyone using it as a shady affair. That is wrong,” he said. “It’s my hotel. I have the right to choose who I let in. It doesn’t matter if they have a booking on OYO or any other travel website, these are my values.” Though the owner did clarify that unmarried out-of-town couples might be able to stay there in “rare” cases, he wouldn’t tolerate locals due to the assumption that any unmarried couple would be using a hotel to have sex. That’s disappointing news for same-sex couples, who cannot legally marry in India. Even being able to get a hotel room doesn’t mean a same-sex couple can sleep easy. Related article
      In a single Delhi house, several hundred years of Indian history The 25-year-old from Delhi identifies as a bisexual woman. She says that even at OYO hotels, it’s impossible to avoid judging eyes. During a recent stay, she says, “my date looked like a tomboy so even though we were two girls it was kind of obvious and you could see they (hotel staff) had a problem with it. “There was a stain on the bed so we complained and the staff member just said ‘So what? You just have to sit, right? There’s a couch; you can sit there,’” she added. If hotels listed on the OYO platform are free to deny accommodation to unmarried couples in a smaller city like Meerut, people looking for privacy will have nowhere left to go, she added. “I live with my family. I can’t just bring someone over. In India it’s very common for people, especially women, to continue living with their families until you get married,” she said. While in Delhi there may be some alternatives, she believes that in cities like Meerut there are none. However, one Meerut hotel owner told CNN that despite the new policy, his rooms would remain accessible to all couples. “Til there are high court orders saying that, you can’t take action against any couple so long as they are adults, then there cannot be such a policy, there’s nothing OYO can do about it,” said Mukesh Gupta, owner of Hotel O Subhadra Residency, one of the top-rated OYO hotels in the city. His hotel was still tagged as “couple friendly” on the app and website. This issue is unlikely to go away. As the country modernizes, it’s more common for couples to live together before marriage or want to get to know each other away from the prying eyes of their families. “In the beginning of our relationship, OYO was a big help to us because I don’t know how we would have managed it at that time,” said Terrance, 28, who did not wish to use his last name, about his relationship with his female partner. Though the couple now resides together, they lived with family for much of their seven-year relationship. Terrance says OYO’s recent moves make him worried for the safety of other young couples in similar situations. “If they don’t have an option sometimes it can end in not such a good way, they might look for some shady place and it might end badly,” he said. Kapadia, the professor, agreed that couples will always find ways to be together but a lack of safe spaces spells disaster, especially for women who have the false burden of carrying the family’s honor. “In India, parks are a space that a lot of couples use for intimacy and everyone knows about it and it’s okay to an extent, but cops or park watchmen often take that opportunity to harass young couples as they know that they’re probably together without their parents’ knowledge,” she said. The rights of the unwed As Gupta pointed out, in India there are no laws against unmarried couples staying together at hotels, in their own cities or elsewhere. Despite this, hotel owners continue to deny them rooms, in several cases with the support of police or government authorities. In 2015, police raided several hotels and lodges near Mumbai, rounding up dozens of couples. In that case, the Bombay High Court said that “the action of the police is in clear violation of right of privacy which has been protected by the Constitution of India and it is a facet of right to life which is guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India.” In 2019, hearing a case of a similar nature a high court in Madras also held that “there are no laws or regulations forbearing unmarried persons of opposite sex to occupy hotel rooms, as guests.” When OYO was contacted for further clarification on their new policy in Meerut, they declined to comment. Aside from the impact on Indians’ right to privacy, Kapadia is also concerned about the long-term implications on tourism in the country. “In many countries, couples choose to spend their lives together without marriage, so if hotel owners start denying them rooms it would not remain as appealing a destination,” she said. However, hotel owner Gupta said that the accommodations that chose to deny couples were likely more concerned with those who had local IDs. Related article
      In today’s India, clothing choices signal a deepening religious divide Following the move from OYO, Tejas Gowda, a member of a militant Hindu nationalist group called Bajrang Dal, told reporters last week he had appealed to the police commissioner and administration in Bengaluru, India’s tech hub, to implement a similar “law” banning unmarried couples from sharing hotel rooms. “We should respect the tradition of our country,” he said. “By allowing unmarried couples inside the rooms there are many illegal activities happening inside the state as well as the country.” These are the very demands that scare the 25-year-old. “According to the Constitution we do have the right to privacy,” she said. “Why are we shutting every damn door that these people can go to. Why is it anyone else’s decision what people do in the privacy of a hotel room?”",,0.16247576475143433
"Millions of Hindu devotees are bathing in sacred waters as the world’s biggest religious gathering begins in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Over the next six weeks, a staggering 400 million people are expected to attend the Maha Kumbh Mela, or the festival of the Sacred Pitcher, on the riverbanks in the city of Prayagraj. Every 12 years the festival carries the prefix “Maha,” which means great, as it’s the largest gathering of the Kumbh Mela that’s held every three years in one of four cities. In Prayagraj, followers will bathe in the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three holy rivers – the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati – to purify their sins and take another step closer to “spiritual liberation.” The Kumbh draws upon Hindu mythology and the legend of demons and gods fighting over a pitcher containing the elixir of immortality. During the fight, four drops from the pitcher fell on Earth, in Prayagraj, Nashik, Haridwar and Ujjain, which host the festival in rotation. The gathering is particularly well-known for attracting large crowds of Hindu holy men, known as sadhus, who travel from across the country. Sadhus are ascetics who have renounced worldly goods and life and are famous for their dreadlocks, ash covered bodies as well as their bright – and at times minimal – clothing. On Tuesday morning, scores of sparsely clad sadhus bathed in the waters as part of a key moment at the start of the festival. Uttar Pradesh’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said late Tuesday that more than 35 million people had “earned the holy benefit of bathing in the uninterrupted and clean Triveni,” or the confluence of the rivers, over the course of the day. Indian Prime Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Narendra Modi has invited people from all over the world to attend the festival, recognized by UNESCO in 2017 as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity.” Authorities are promoting the event not just as a religious gathering but a cultural spectacle that in the past has attracted both Bollywood and Hollywood stars. Formerly known as Allahabad, Prayagraj was renamed by Adityanath in 2018, a decision that was said to recognize the city’s identity as a spiritual destination for Hindu pilgrims. Shedding the name Allahabad, given to the city by Mughal emperor Akbar, was a symbolic move in keeping with Modi’s ambitions to transform India from a secular, pluralistic state into a nation of and for the Hindu faith. This year’s festival has taken years of planning and millions of dollars to build facilities for the influx of visitors to Prayagraj, a city normally home to 6 million people. Around 160,000 tents, 150,000 toilets and a 776-mile (1,249-kilometer) drinking water pipeline have been installed at a temporary tent city covering 4,000 hectares, roughly the size of 7,500 football fields. In 2013, dozens of people were killed and injured in a crowd crush at a railway station as pilgrims gathered in the city. Such deadly incidents at religious gatherings in India are not uncommon, often highlighting a lack of adequate crowd control and safety measures. This year, officials say extra safety measures have been put in place in Prayagraj to protect visitors, including a security ring with checkpoints around the city staffed by more than 1,000 police officers. Over 2,700 security cameras powered by artificial intelligence will be positioned around the city, monitored by hundreds of experts at key locations, according to the central government. Aerial drones will provide surveillance from above and for the first time, underwater drones capable of diving up to 100 meters will be activated to provide round-the-clock cover, the government added. Vast numbers of pilgrims are expected to travel to the region by train, so authorities have added 3,000 special trains and 13,100 train services. Fourteen new flyovers and underpasses, 11 new road corridors, 7,000 buses, 550 shuttle buses, seven new bus stops, and 30 pontoon bridges have also been added to improve connectivity, according to the Uttar Pradesh state government. The festival ends on February 26.",,0.2892816662788391
"China and India have agreed to resume direct commercial flights for the first time in five years, in the latest sign of warming relations between the world’s two most populous countries. Flights between India and mainland China were suspended at the onset of the Covid pandemic in early 2020, and remained halted following subsequent political tensions. The announcement on Monday came as India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing. In a statement, India’s Ministry of External Affairs said the two countries had reached a consensus “in principle to resume direct air services,” with officials expected to hammer out details “at an early date.” Confirming the development, China’s Foreign Ministry also said it had agreed to reopen Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar in western Tibet to Indian pilgrims this year. The two destinations are considered sacred in the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Bon faiths and are popular pilgrimage sites. Related article
      China unveils prototype for what could be the world’s fastest high-speed train Behind the scenes Months after flights were suspended due to the pandemic, soldiers from the two countries fought a bloody hand-to-hand battle at their disputed border high in the Himalayas, in which at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed. Both India and China maintain a significant military presence along their 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which has never been clearly defined and has remained a source of friction since a war between the two countries in 1962. The June 2020 clash was followed by a process of disengagement and border talks, including an agreement on military patrolling. But points of friction have remained in other areas. The two countries have sought to further ease tensions in recent months, following a rare meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia this past October. Currently, there are direct passenger flights between several Indian cities and Hong Kong, but not mainland China. Related article
      In a single Delhi house, several hundred years of Indian history Tourists look forward The news of the agreement to resume commercial flights prompted some to share their enthusiasm on Chinese social media platform Weibo. One Chinese netizen said he had bought a flight ticket to India in February 2020 — during the early days of the pandemic. But just before he was due to depart, both his flight and visa were canceled, he said. India suspended all tourist visas early into the pandemic in a bid to halt the spread of Covid-19. “The wait lasted for five years… Must go to India,” he wrote in a post on Monday. Another Chinese netizen said he hoped to attend the Indian festival of Holi, also known as the festival of colors, which involves people donning simple, inexpensive clothes and taking to the streets to smear each other with colored powder and engage in mass water fights. “Is there a chance to make it to Holi in March?” he wondered. Passengers were previously able to travel directly between Beijing and New Delhi within seven hours. Presently, those wishing to travel between the two capitals are required to transit at destinations such as Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur adding between six and 10 hours to the journey. Anayat Ali, an Indian PhD student in Shanghai told CNN he “welcomed the news enthusiastically.” Ali said he and other Indian students in China were sick of the long layovers and high ticket prices every time they wanted to return home. “With direct flights, I can visit family more frequently, reduce expenses and avoid the stress of layovers,” he said. Chinese authorities and airlines had been asking India’s civil aviation authorities to re-establish direct flights, but New Delhi had resisted the calls, Reuters reported last June. But the drawn-out negotiations have prompted some on Weibo to express doubts about the possibility of visiting India anytime soon. “It’s an agreement in principle,” one of them noted on Monday.",,0.20403456687927246
"An Olympic story of hope and perseverance quickly turned to one of heartbreak after an Indian wrestler known for her role in anti-sexual harassment protests was disqualified from the gold medal match of the women’s 50kg freestyle category. Vinesh Phogat, the first Indian woman to qualify for an Olympic wrestling final, did not make the weight required to compete Wednesday morning, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said. “Despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50kg this morning,” the IOA said in a statement posted to X. Competition rules say wrestlers must stay in their weight category on both days of the tournament. After Phogat’s disqualification, only the gold and bronze medals will be awarded in this event. United World Wrestling, the sport’s international governing body, has yet to comment, Reuters reported. A little over a year ago, Phogat was sleeping on the streets of New Delhi as part of an athlete-led protest calling out sexual harassment allegations within her sport. Before the latest cruel twist of fate, she had appeared guaranteed to come away from the Paris Olympics with either a gold or silver medal in a remarkable tale of overcoming adversity. Phogat, a three-time Olympian who comes from a prominent Indian wrestling family, was set to face Team USA’s Sarah Hildebrandt in Wednesday’s final. Her journey had included one of the most stunning upsets of the Games so far when she beat reigning Olympic gold medalist Yui Susaki in a dramatic first-round bout. Sasaki, who was widely touted as the best pound-for-pound freestyle wrestler in the world, had never lost a fight at the senior level and during the last Olympics in Tokyo did not even drop a point on her way to gold. But Phogat came through with a late takedown to claim a 3-2 decision in their opening match before besting Ukraine’s Oksana Livach 7-5 and Cuba’s Yusneylis Guzman Lopez 5-0 on her path to the medal podium. Following news of her disqualification, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Phogat a “champion among champions” and “India’s pride” in a post on X. “Today’s setback hurts. I wish words could express the sense of despair that I am experiencing. At the same time, I know that you epitomise resilience. It has always been your nature to take challenges head on,” he wrote, adding: “Come back stronger! We are all rooting for you.” ‘Lioness of India’ In India, Phogat and her fellow wrestlers have become the very public face of an ongoing protest movement that has created global headlines and sparked a fierce #MeToo debate. She and other top wrestlers camped for weeks last year demanding action on sexual harassment claims made against the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). In January 2023, Phogat and other leading wrestlers wrote to the head of the Indian Olympic Association in a letter posted to X, demanding an inquiry into claims of sexual harassment by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who is also a powerful politician from India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. In the letter, Phogat said had been “mentally harassed and tortured” by Singh after she missed out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. The athletes then took to the streets to demand Singh’s dismissal, but paused their protests after India’s sports ministry said it would investigate. But after months went by with little apparent action, Phogat and the other wrestlers took to the streets again, camping out for weeks in protests that became a flashpoint of criticism against India’s ruling establishment and ended in bitter clashes with police. “We’re Olympians, gold medalists, world champions,” Phogat told CNN from the protest site last year. “There’s been a grave injustice. We’ve dedicated (our lives) to our country.” Dramatic images showed Phogat, her sister and fellow wrestler Sangeeta Phogat, and Sakshi Malik – who won bronze in 2016 in the 58 kg category – being dragged by officers. The wrestlers were detained but later released. In the days after, some of the wrestlers vowed to throw their Olympic medals in the Ganges river, the country’s sacred waterway. “These medals decorating our necks no longer mean anything,” the athletes said in a statement. “What is the point of life when you compromise on dignity?” In June, Delhi police charged Singh with assault, stalking and sexual harassment. He has denied all allegations against him. Before her disqualification, Phogat’s fellow wrestlers hailed her journey to the final as both a personal and collective triumph for India’s wrestling community who have long complained that authorities failed to take their allegations seriously. “Vinesh Phogat is the lioness of India who won back-to-back matches today,” Bajrang Punia, who won bronze in Tokyo and was also a leading figure in the protests, wrote on X. “This girl was kicked and crushed in her own country. This girl was dragged on the streets in her country. This girl is going to conquer the world but she lost to the system in this country.” This story has been updated with additional information.

By the time he died, aged just 32, he had redrawn the map of the northern hemisphere, conquering land across three continents and ruling over states from Egypt to modern-day India — over 2,000 years ago. Since his death in 323 BCE, the world has been obsessed with Alexander the Great, who set out from his kingdom of Macedon (in modern-day Greece) at the age of 20 to conquer the mighty Persian Empire. He made it as far as the Indus River in modern-day Pakistan, and even crossed into today’s India, before dying in Babylon in today’s Iraq. Over 2,000 years later, travelers can still see his legacy in countries as far afield as Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan — as well as Greece, of course, where, in 2024, archaeologists opened the Royal Palace of Aigai to visitors. The palace was the ceremonial hub for the Macedonian dynasty, and Alexander was crowned here following the assassination of his father, Philip II. There are dozens more sites around the globe where visitors can get close to the man — and the myth. A mysterious death What Alexander achieved in his 32 years is “unique,” says Paul Cartledge, AG Leventis professor emeritus of Greek culture at the University of Cambridge, who adds that the Macedonian “redrew the map of the world” by force, where his father had always tried diplomacy first. Crowned king of Macedon in 336 BCE at the age of 20, Alexander spent just two years in Europe after Philip’s assassination, shoring up his rule and putting down revolts in southern Greece and the Balkans. Then, in 334 BCE, he led his army into Asia to fulfil Philip’s ambition of conquering the Persian Empire — the largest in the world at that time. Over a 10-year period, fighting across modern-day Turkey, the Middle East, and as far away as Afghanistan and Pakistan, Alexander routed Persian king Darius III, taking the empire for his own. His territory now extended from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River — and he was only 30. From there, he pressed on into the Indian subcontinent and into modern-day Pakistan’s Punjab province, where he made further conquests, pushing into modern-day India, before his weary army rebelled. They turned back but on the way home, Alexander was struck by a two-week fever and died in Babylon. His body was taken to Egypt and was said to have been entombed in Alexandria, where it was venerated by everyone from Cleopatra to Julius Caesar, before disappearing in around the fifth century. It has never been found. Related article
      Greece reopens 2,400-year-old palace where Alexander the Great was crowned Alexander died without having ever lost a battle, and while his empire soon splintered, for centuries, the official language of administration in the area remained Greek. “That’s why Greek spread all over the Middle East, and why the New Testament is written in Greek,” says Cartledge. While he was hated by many Athenians, who believed in democracy not monarchies or empires — and while, Cartledge says, some followers of Zoroastrianism, an ancient monotheistic religion, still think of him as evil for destroying their ancient records in Persepolis, modern-day Iran — since his death Alexander has achieved an almost god-like status. For Cartledge, Alexander was unique. “It takes an exceptional personality to preside over what he did,” he says, citing Genghis Khan as one of the few leaders of his caliber. ‘He overcame everything’ Alexander’s legacy is no stuffy history lesson. In fact, the story of the young man from Macedonia who pushed to the boundaries of the world has had fans from the word go. In the Roman period, writers including Arrian and Plutarch composed biographies of Alexander. Next, the “Alexander Romance” — first written in third-century Alexandria in Egypt — became hugely popular. Essentially a novel based on his life, it was translated into languages including Arabic and Persian — “every language in the world,” according to Pierre Briant, professor emeritus at the Collège de France, “The Achaemenid empire and Alexander’s empire” chair. In 1010 CE, Persian poet Firdawsi wrote “Shahnamah,” the “Book of Kings,” which portrayed Alexander as Sikander, a Persian, and half-brother to Dara, or Darius. In this, Alexander preserves Persia’s Zoroastrian religion. Briant says the book went “everywhere in the Middle and Far East” — even to Indonesia. Today, cities from Alexandria in Egypt to Kandahar in Afghanistan are named for Alexander. “I think it’s a combination of his age — he did so much before he died — and the extraordinary distance that he traveled,” says Cartledge. “He got as far as modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, a bit of India. He didn’t always go through very nicely, but he triumphed over ever possible obstacle: a mountain, a river, war elephants, scythed chariots. Everything that was thrown at him, he overcame.” Even today, people are catching the Alexander bug. “When I was a teenager I hated history,” says Peter Sommer, a UK tour operator who owes his career to Alexander. At school, Sommer planned to specialize in sciences, but one day his history teacher showed pupils a map of Alexander’s travels. “My jaw fell open, hit the desk, and I went home and said, ‘I want to study ancient history,’” he says. Related article
      The hidden ‘eagle’s nest’ city that Alexander the Great couldn’t conquer He changed his courses and went on to study ancient history and archaeology at university, writing his undergraduate thesis and masters dissertation on Alexander-related topics. He also embarked on a four-and-a-half-month, 2,000-mile hike through modern-day Turkey, recreating Alexander’s progress from the ancient city of Troy to the location of the Battle of Issus in modern-day Anatolia, where he first beat Darius. “I thought, ‘How can I understand Alexander if I haven’t been to the places?’” he says. “I’d never traveled before, but I fell in love with travel and with Turkey.” Having completed a similar project for the BBC, he launched his own tour company, Peter Sommer Travels, taking small groups on cultural, archaeological and food itineraries. Sommer has run Alexander-themed tours across Turkey and Greece, and says his clients on those tours are “totally mixed.” While you might imagine that tours following in the steps of a great warrior might be male-focused, Sommer says that “we have lots of female travelers who are completely nuts about Alexander.” Perhaps that’s because of his rather 21st-century approach to women. Unlike ancient conquerors who took rape and pillage as their right in victory, Alexander tended to stick to the latter and eschew the former. In one memorable story, having defeated Darius (who fled) at the Battle of Issus, Alexander captured the Persian royals, including Darius’ wife and mother. Instead of enslaving them, as might have been expected, he treated them with dignity. Sisygambis, Darius’ mother, came to love Alexander as a second son, and even died of grief after his death, the story goes. What ancient figure could be more suited to a 21st-century audience than this unlikely respectful king? Sommer says his clients on the Alexander tours are “total Alexander enthusiasts… they wanted to talk about him at every lunch, every dinner.” He puts it down to Alexander’s “charisma” that still shines through the centuries. “What fascinated me is how someone could do all this by the age of 32,” he says. “To have had the biggest military campaign ever. To lead from the front, up to 100,000 troops. His charisma must have been extraordinary.” For his clients, traveling in the footsteps of Alexander can be emotional. One, who writes the Mega Alexandros blog but prefers to stay anonymous for privacy reasons, recalls an “unforgettable” drive through Iran’s Zagros mountains when a sandstorm swept up from Mesapotamia, Iraq. “The bus stopped and sand was in my face, pulling at my clothes,” they say. “I thought, Alexander must have had such days. They had to march through that.’” In Uzbekistan, on an eight-hour bus ride from Tashkent to Bukhara, they thought, “My god, how did they do it? I couldn’t move at the pace his soldiers walked. When you’re on the spot and see the landscape, it’s totally different. You learn to look at the landscape because they had to. For me there’s nothing that can replace that.” Projecting our fantasies Alexander has joined an elite group of usually mythical figures whose characters shapeshift along with society’s beliefs and desires. “The histories keep changing,” says Sommer. “He gets written up completely differently according to the time. He’s like a renaissance man that people interpret for themselves.” Cartledge says “We project our dreams, fantasies and nightmares on people we call great. They’re by no means always good, but they achieve something way beyond what you or I possibly could.” But Cartledge also says Alexander was a great propagandist. Two thousand years on, we still largely believe ‘his’ side of the story. He even linked himself to Homer’s mythical hero Achilles, adding romantic and homoerotic sides to his legacy. Although he thinks Alexander’s episodes of slaughter — especially towards the end of his campaign — are a “a real stain on his memory,” Cartledge says “I admire him intensely. He was very brave, charismatic, had very great qualities, but also did some absolutely awful things. He was unique.” A racist legacy? One person who interprets Alexander a little differently from most is Briant. An expert on both the Macedonian and the Achaemenid (Persian) empires, and author of A short introduction: Alexander the Great, Briant bristles at the idea that Alexander achieved something that had never been done before. The clue, he says, is in what Alexander did: conquer the Persian Empire. “You can’t speak of Alexander alone as if he were a kind of supernatural person and without any context,” he says. “If you speak of conquests, you have to speak about the Achaemenid Empire. The Persian king had conquered Persia 200 years earlier, so when Alexander came to conquer the Middle East he had to conquer an organized empire. He was not the first.” In fact, says Briant, there’s a simple reason why, 2,000 years on, we talk about Alexander but not Cyrus the Great, who founded the Achaemenid Empire in 550 BCE: racism. “We are Europe-focused,” he says of historians. “Alexander has taken an enormous place in European thought from antiquity to the modern era. He was considered the first conqueror of the east… a precedent for European conquerors. Some 18th and 19th-century historians explained his victories as announcing the future victories of European armies against the Ottomans. It has become a kind of European political myth, and very important for European thoughts about Asia and the Middle East.” One of his books looks at the concept of Alexander as the “First European.” Greek and Roman authors weren’t interested in the Persian Empire, he says — meaning that even from antiquity, it was effectively erased from history.

      Ancient pot of gold unearthed in Turkey hints at ‘gravest misfortune,’ researchers say “When I speak with colleagues, especially from the US, working on Alexander, I ask, ‘Why are you not interested in the history of the Persian Empire?’ Some respond, “It’s too difficult, it’s another world.’ In fact it’s the same world,” he says. He calls Oliver Stone’s 2004 film, “Alexander,” starring Colin Farrell, “completely foolish” for its lack of Persian context. Briant even rubbishes the idea of the Hellenization of the east that took place after Alexander — when Greek became the official language. “This didn’t mean the local culture disappeared — quite the contrary,” he says, adding that everyone from the Egyptians to the Babylonians used their own language, too. Instead, he calls it a “meeting of cultures:” something that Alexander — who appalled his troops by dressing in Persian robes, married a woman from what is now known as Afghanistan (Roxana), and buffered his army with Persian soldiers — would surely have approved of. While today we see Alexander’s behavior as multiculturalism, in reality it was political, says Briant. “Alexander was fighting for 13 years —– his main concern was maintaining an army,” he says. “By the end the army was mainly Iranian, and maybe he was concerned about culture, but the main point was to maintain military forces.” The same goes for his marriage to Roxana, which Briant calls “political,” About Alexander’s legendary treatment of Sisygambis, Cartledge agrees Alexander “wanted [the Persian royals] to buy into the new order.” Related article
      In Turkey, a modern city sits alongside a mythical site Although Briant acknowledges Alexander’s brilliance on the battlefield, his courage and intelligence, he emphasizes that the Macedonian wasn’t conquering brand-new territory, mile by mile, but a pre-existing empire. “He conquered the Persian empire and its frontiers — it was his main goal,” says Briant. “That’s why it’s important to know about the Persian Empire. You can’t understand Alexander if you don’t understand Darius, the last king of the Persian Empire.” Not for nothing is one of his books “Darius in the shadow of Alexander.” Rather than Alexander or even Darius III, Briant says the man we should be venerating is Darius I, “the main conqueror and organizer of the empire.” Thousands of clay tablets found in Persepolis, in modern-day Iran, are finally being translated — and they show his importance, he says. Cartledge — author of “Alexander the Great” — agrees that Darius I was a formidable ruler, who tolerated other religions. “But I’d say as a Greek historian that the impact of Alexander taking over what Darius had created made [the empire] even more amazing,” he says. “He transmitted a Greco-Persian culture. Darius was an amazing figure but I’d say Alexander’s achievement was even greater.” Following in Alexander’s footsteps Visitors to modern-day Iran can see remains of the empire at Persepolis, Susa and Pasargadae, the first capital of the Achaemenid Empire. While in northern Greece you’ll find Pella, the ruined city where Alexander was born, as well as the tomb of Philip and other Macedonian royals in a spectacular underground museum at Vergina (ancient Aigai), and the newly opened royal palace above. A little further south, at the foot of Mount Olympus (the most sacred site in Ancient Greece) is Dion, where Alexander made sacrifices to the god Zeus before setting out for Persia. And east of Aigai, past Thessaloniki (which was named for Alexander’s half-sister) is Philippi, renamed by Philip after he conquered it. There, an inscription in the museum bears a missive from Alexander ruling on a boundary dispute. In Turkey, Sommer recommends the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, where there are two statues of Alexander as well as the Alexander Sarcophagus, a fourth-century BCE sarcophagus found in Lebanon, intricately carved with scenes from the life of the king. Myths and as yet unproven theories also link him to other sites across the northern hemisphere. The ancient Thracian city of Perperikon, perched on a hilltop, in Bulgaria is said to be the legendary Oracle of Dionysus, where Alexander is said to have been told he would conquer the world, before setting out for Persia. And some even believe that his bones were stolen from Alexandria by Venetians, who mistook them for the relics of St. Mark, which they ransacked from the Egyptian city and took home. Could they be the remains guarded closely in St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice? End of the rainbow Nobody knows what Alexander was planning when he died, though it’s thought he was eying the Persian Gulf and more of northern Africa. But his legend has lived on. And despite his flaws, perhaps we could all be a little bit more Alexander. “He didn’t spare himself. He didn’t play the long game. He tried to achieve as much as he could in the shortest possible time, possibly realizing he was going to die early,” says Cartledge. For his fans, he is an inspiration across the centuries. “Alexander was a driven person,” says the Mega Alexandros blogger. “He went off to his end of the rainbow — and he never doubted he would reach it.”",,0.2550061047077179
"The competition was tight until the very last shot. India’s Abhinav Bindra was level with his closest rival going into the final round of the men’s 10-meter air rifle at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Then, with a near-perfect shot, Bindra won India’s first-ever individual Olympic gold. It was a historic achievement that many in India hoped could prove a turning point for the giant country following many decades of underperformance at the Olympics. But 16 years, four Summer Games and just one additional gold medal later, those dreams have largely failed to materialize. India, home to more than 1.4 billion people, is the world’s most populous country, according to the United Nations. In 2022, India surpassed Britain as the world’s fifth largest economy, and last year became one of just four countries to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon. And it’s led by an ambitious prime minister who has widespread influence on the global stage. But when it comes to the Olympics, India punches below its weight. India won just six medals in Paris, falling short of its record haul of seven at Tokyo in 2021. The United States, with less than a quarter of India’s population, topped the charts with 126 medals followed by China with 91. India ranked 71st in the medal table, below nations with much smaller populations including Georgia, Kazakhstan and North Korea. India has now won just 41 Olympic medals in total since its debut in 1900, all at the Summer Games. “There is no doubt that India has been an underperformer in the Olympics and generally in global sports,” said Ronojoy Sen, author of “Nation at Play: A History of Sport in India.” “If you look at the population to medal ratio it is probably the worst.” Among the bright spots for India in Paris, javelin ace Neeraj Chopra added silver to the gold he won at Tokyo 2020, and shooter Manu Bhaker clinched double bronze to become the first Indian woman to win two medals at the same Games. Vinesh Phogat, known for her high-profile role in anti-sexual harassment protests, became the first Indian woman to qualify for a wrestling final in the women’s 50kg freestyle – only to be disqualified for failing to make her weight class. On Wednesday, her appeal for a silver medal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. CNN reached out to the Indian Olympic Association for comment on the team’s performance in Paris. Major hurdles India’s history of untapped Olympic potential can be explained by several factors, according to experts, with underinvestment in sports being a major culprit. New Delhi has never poured resources into a national training program like those of traditional Olympic powerhouses, which have long regarded gold medals as a symbol of national strength, Sen said. “For nations like the USA, China and the (then) Soviet Union, sport was very much a part of their nascent national story, it was a means for global recognition and glory,” he said. The most successful Olympic nations also identify and develop talent from a young age, he added, pointing to China, where “you see kids being trained right from the moment they can walk.” Indian athletes often face obstacles such as inadequate funding and a lack of access to facilities, analysts say. “When people say 1.4 billion people and only (six) medals, that is a totally wrong headline, because … 1.39 billion people don’t have access to sports facilities,” said Boria Majumdar, sports analyst and author of “Dreams of a Billion: India and the Olympic Games.” India sends far fewer athletes and support staff to the Olympics than top teams like the US, Majumdar said. For example, 117 Indian competitors went to Paris, compared with nearly 600 Americans. India also faces broader health challenges that impede development and curtail sporting potential from childhood, experts say. India ranked 111th of 125 countries in the 2023 Global Hunger Index report. At 18.7%, it has the world’s highest child wasting rate – the number of children who are too thin for their height – reflecting acute undernutrition. More than one third of children under age 5 in India are stunted due to malnutrition, meaning they are too short for their age, according to the report. “Until we address some of these basic concerns around nutrition, it will be very hard for us to achieve greater excellence at the highest level of sport where victories are counted in milliseconds,” Sen said. Another challenge to Olympic progress is the additional barriers faced by women athletes in India, in what remains a deeply patriarchal nation. “Right from childhood, when I started wrestling, people would tease me saying that ‘she’s a girl what can she do, why is she entering a male sport?’” said Sakshi Malik, an Indian wrestler who won bronze at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Malik quit wrestling last year amid controversy over sexual harassment allegations against India’s wrestling chief, which saw Malik, Phogat and other wrestlers sleeping on the streets of Delhi for weeks demanding action. “I gave up my sport which I love beyond all else for this fight because I bear that responsibility of protecting the younger athletes who come after me,” Malik said. “Things have to change.” Untapped potential While India’s overall showing in Paris may not have wowed, fans celebrated the feats of the country’s medalists in social media posts in an outpouring of pride and admiration. Individual athletes have the power to galvanize a population, Majumdar said. “To think that the entire country is watching javelin at 2 a.m. because of one man, that is a revolution,” he said, referring to the millions watching back home as India’s Chopra won silver in Paris. India’s massive Olympic potential is perhaps best underlined by its status in cricket, by far the country’s most popular sport and one in which it has become the dominant global force. Cricket has not been included in the Olympics since 1900 but is set to return at Los Angeles 2028, to the excitement of Indian fans and players, who will be chasing gold. While cricket’s multi-billion-dollar Indian Premier League is the most visible sign of sports investment in the country, other sports have also received a boost in recent years - both from increased corporate sponsorship and government funding. In 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched “Khelo India” or “Let’s Play India,” a nationwide program to “revive the sports culture” in the country with the aim of identifying and funding promising young talent, particularly in rural areas. That same year, India also revamped its Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), which supports and funds training, international competition, equipment and coaching for elite athletes. As of July 2024, India’s sports ministry had allocated nearly $260 million to state governments to develop sport infrastructure under the Khelo India program. Sen, the author, said there is also a growing realization in India of the soft power potential of global sporting success, citing Modi taking the time to call Olympic medalists to congratulate them. “I appreciate the efforts of the Indian contingent through the games,” Modi wrote on X on Monday. “All the athletes have given their best and every Indian is proud of them.” During the International Olympic Committee’s annual meeting in Mumbai last year, Modi told sports officials that India would bid to host the 2036 Summer Games, the Associated Press reported. The IOC said it also expects to soon add an Indian sponsor to its roster of 15 top-tier partners, which together gave the Games almost $740 million last year – another sign of India’s growing Olympic ambitions. Majumdar, the sports analyst, believes India’s best Olympic days are yet to come. “I think the journey has started but it’s not going to happen overnight,” he said, pointing out that India spends just a fracture of US expenditure on sports infrastructure. “In another decade I believe India has the potential to be in the top half of medals.”",,0.25295716524124146
"Teenager Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest-ever undisputed classical chess world champion after beating Ding Liren 7.5-6.5 in their best-of-14 final in Singapore on Thursday. The 18-year-old Gukesh and defending champion Ding entered the last game tied and things appeared to be headed to rapid chess tiebreaks, but it was the youngster who was able to claim the crucial point after a blunder from Ding. As his victory was confirmed, Gukesh broke into tears as the emotion of his victory appeared to wave over him, while Ding could only sit with his head in his hands in disbelief. Related article
      ‘Like climbing Mount Everest:’ Inside the grueling world of the Chess World Championship After standing with his arms aloft in celebration, Gukesh was escorted out the building where he shared a long embrace with his father. Social media clips showed fans back in India celebrating Gukesh’s victory wildly, cheering and hugging as he became the 18th world chess champion and just the country’s second world champion after Viswanathan Anand. Afterwards, a jubilant Gukesh admitted he hadn’t initially recognized Ding’s mistake in the final game. But when he realized his Chinese opponent had made the crucial error, he said “it was probably the best moment of my life.” At 18, he is four years younger than the legendary Garry Kasparov was when the Russian won his first world title in 1985. Heartiest congratulations to Gukesh for becoming the youngest player to win the World Chess Championship. He has done India immensely proud. His victory stamps the authority of India as a chess powerhouse. Well done Gukesh! On behalf of every Indian, I wish you sustained glory… Gukesh added in his press conference: “My journey, it’s been since the time I started playing chess at six-and-a-half, seven (years old). I’ve been dreaming about this moment for more than 10 years. “Every chess player wants to experience this moment and very few get the chance. To be one of them – I think the only way to explain it is I am living my dream. I would like to thank God first of all. This whole journey starting from qualifying to the (qualifying tournament) Candidates, then coming here, it could only be possible by God. There were so many miracles. “And I’m thankful for all the people who have been by my side on this journey. I would like to thank each and every one of them, but probably I will have to prepare my speech first because (with) the kind of emotions I’m feeling right now I’ll say something stupid.” India jubilant India has become a major chess powerhouse with a host of young talent storming onto the scene. Among the young stars India has is Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa (R Praggnanandhaa), who famously stunned the chess world by beating Carlsen in 2022. “Pragg,” as he is known to fans, became the youngest international chess master at the age of 10 and the second-youngest grandmaster in the world at 12. Last year, he and his sister, 22-year-old Rameshbabu Vaishali (R Vaishali), became the first-ever brother and sister duo to obtain grandmaster titles. Congratulations and declarations of pride poured in from across India following Gukesh’s win. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Gukesh, writing on X: “Historic and exemplary! Congratulations to Gukesh D on his remarkable accomplishment. This is the result of his unparalleled talent, hard work and unwavering determination. “His triumph has not only etched his name in the annals of chess history but has also inspired millions of young minds to dream big and pursue excellence. My best wishes for his future endeavours.” Draupadi Murmu, India’s president, said Gukesh’s win “stamps the authority of India as a chess powerhouse.” Sports figures also lavished the new grandmaster with praise. Anand commended his compatriot for bringing the world title back to India. Related article

"Vinesh Phogat, the first Indian woman to qualify for an Olympic wrestling final, appeared to announce her retirement from the sport in a heartbreaking statement. In a social media post, Phogat said her spirit was broken after she was disqualified from the gold medal match of the women’s 50kg freestyle category. “Mom, wrestling defeated me. I have lost. Please forgive me. Your dream, my spirit, it’s all shattered. I don’t have more strength than this now,” she said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Goodbye wrestling 2001-2024” “I’ll forever be indebted to you. Please forgive me,” she added. A cruel twist of fate Phogat, a three-time Olympian who comes from a prominent Indian wrestling family, was set to face Team USA’s Sarah Hildebrandt in Wednesday’s final. Her journey to the final had included one of the most stunning upsets of the Games so far when she beat reigning Olympic gold medalist Yui Susaki in a dramatic first-round bout. Susaki, who was widely touted as the best pound-for-pound freestyle wrestler in the world, had never lost a fight at the senior level and did not even drop a point on her way to gold at the last Olympics in Tokyo. Phogat came through with a late takedown to claim a 3-2 decision in their opening match before besting Ukraine’s Oksana Livach 7-5 and Cuba’s Yusneylis Guzmán López 5-0 on her march to the medal podium. However, Phogat did not make the weight required to compete Wednesday morning, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said Tuesday. Competition rules say wrestlers must stay in their weight category on both days of the tournament. After Phogat’s disqualification, only the gold and bronze medals were awarded in the event. Before the disqualification, she had been guaranteed to come away from the Paris Olympics with either a gold or silver medal in a remarkable tale of overcoming adversity. A story of perseverance Phogat’s story is one of hope and perseverance. A little over a year ago, she was sleeping on the streets of New Delhi as part of an athlete-led protest demanding action on sexual harassment claims made against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and a powerful politician from India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Dramatic images showed Phogat, her sister and fellow wrestler Sangeeta Phogat, and Sakshi Malik – who won bronze in 2016 in the 58 kg category – being dragged by officers. The wrestlers were detained but later released. In June, Delhi police charged Singh with assault, stalking and sexual harassment. He has denied all allegations against him. Before her disqualification, Phogat’s fellow wrestlers hailed her journey to the final as both a personal and collective triumph for India’s wrestling community who have long complained that authorities failed to take their allegations seriously. “Vinesh Phogat is the lioness of India who won back-to-back matches today,” Bajrang Punia, who won bronze in Tokyo and was also a leading figure in the protests, wrote on X. “This girl was kicked and crushed in her own country. This girl was dragged on the streets in her country. This girl is going to conquer the world but she lost to the system in this country.” CNN’s Lex Harvey and Aishwarya S Iyer contributed to this report.",,0.3792039155960083

      Indian Gukesh Dommaraju, 18, becomes the youngest ever chess world champion after Ding Liren blunder The 18-year-old beat defending champion Ding Liren 7.5-6.5 in their best-of-14 final in Singapore on Thursday after the Chinese player blundered in the final game. Draped in the Indian flag and holding his trophy, Gukesh was met by hundreds of fans upon returning to his home city. “Thank you for all the support. It means a lot to bring back the trophy to India,” he told reporters. “I hope we can have a great time in the next few days celebrating together.” “You guys are amazing,” he said of his fans. “You gave me so much energy. Looking forward to meeting you all.” Gukesh’s welcome resembled that of a rock star or famous cricketer, with confetti, banners, crowds singing his name and even men on stilts. The champion arrived and left in a personalized car, decorated with the words: “The new king in the kingdom of chess!” The 18-year-old landed in Chennai having also completed a bungee jump in Singapore to celebrate his victory. Gukesh broke into tears upon winning the final match against Ding last week, becoming the youngest world champion by more than four years. The record was previously held by chess legend Garry Kasparov, who was 22 years old when he won his first world title in 1985. The 18-year-old is also just the second Indian player to have claimed the title, following five-time world champion Viswanathan “Vishy” Anand, who also grew up in Chennai. The newly crowned champion is expected to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi later in December, according to The Guardian. Modi congratulated Gukesh on his victory on Thursday, calling the win “historic and exemplary.” “This is the result of his unparalleled talent, hard work and unwavering determination,” he continued. “His triumph has not only etched his name in the annals of chess history but has also inspired millions of young minds to dream big and pursue excellence.”",,0.358490526676178
"Turning a food giant like PepsiCo — whose portfolio includes Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade and Mountain Dew — away from fat, sugar and salt might sound like a recipe for disaster. And yet that is exactly what Indra Nooyi did when she was the company’s CEO, from 2006 to 2018. During her tenure, net revenue grew more than 80%. “In the life of a CEO, every day is a challenge,” she tells CNN in her office in Greenwich, Connecticut. “Boards pick CEOs because they’re resilient, they can actually find a way through all of these challenges and transform the company. And that’s what I had to do. I had to make sure our portfolio was shifting to a good blend of ‘treat for you’ products, ‘fun for you’ products, and then add the ‘better for you’ and ‘good for you’ products. “I had to reduce the environmental footprint. I had to make sure people felt charged and excited to come to work for PepsiCo while delivering performance. That was the single biggest challenge.” Nooyi was born in Madras (today Chennai), India, and emigrated to the United States in 1978 to study at the Yale School of Management, where she also worked as a receptionist to sustain herself. She joined Pepsi in 1994, aged 39, and served as its president and chief financial officer before becoming CEO — a role that made her the first woman of color and first immigrant to lead a Fortune 50 company. “I just looked at the assignment and said, Oh my God, I better do right by women, by people of color, by immigrants, by people of Indian origin,” she says. “I wanted to do right by everybody, but most importantly, I wanted to make sure I was a good steward of PepsiCo. And so at that point, I didn’t think of the historic role that I was playing. “In retrospect, though, I’m realizing now it was very frame breaking. And in so many ways, I broke so many barriers,” she adds. Happy retirement Fortune magazine named Nooyi number one on its annual Most Powerful Women in business ranking from 2006 through 2010, and Forbes magazine included her on the list of The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women from 2008 through 2017, her last full year at Pepsi. “When I decided to retire, I was exhausted and I had lots of successes,” she says. “I had been on the job for 12 years, 12 great years, and I actually thought I’d miss PepsiCo a lot. (But) the next day I was a new person and I never missed my old job. Even for a minute. “I miss some of the people, but not the job, because I had so many things I could do here. Things that ranged from interesting boards to nonprofits to working on issues that always interested me.” Since early 2019, she has been a member of the board of directors at Amazon. She is also a member of the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum and an honorary co-chair for the World Justice Project, an organization that works to advance the rule of law worldwide. Nooyi is widely regarded as a visionary in American business history, and says her own definition of the word is “somebody who sees the future but makes change today towards that future.” But getting there wasn’t easy, and sometimes came at the expense of her own work-life balance, a topic she explored deeply in “My Life in Full,” her memoir, published in 2021. “I worked incredibly hard. This was not a job that just came to me,” she says. “I earned it. I put the company before me. I put the company before me at every point in time. Whatever I did, I wanted to make sure it made a difference for the company.” Lasting legacy Looking back, she points to her parents as her initial source of empowerment and inspiration. “My parents allowed me to do wild things like climb trees and fall down and play in a rock band — so everything that a traditional woman in India didn’t do,” she says. “So in many ways, as I always say, I won the lottery of life.” Today, Nooyi can boast no less than 15 honorary degrees from the likes of Yale, Penn State and Duke, her portrait hangs in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, and in 2021 she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame.

There’s Lionel Richie, Don Felder (formerly of The Eagles). I don’t play them anymore because I just don’t have the time. But I look at them and I think back to all of those halftime show performances or where I met these artists and I live this life where I go, I cannot believe I met Blake Shelton.” Asked about her lasting legacy, she points at the young people she mentored at Pepsi who are now in leading roles in the corporate world. “People remember you for not just your business contributions, they also remember you for the people you developed, nurtured, mentored,” she says. “I look at all of them and say, hey, you went through my school of hard knocks and you’re doing great.”",,0.31045499444007874
"Searching for something? From queries about US politics to cricket in India, Wikipedia has become a source of information for millions of people across the globe. The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that operates the site, released on Tuesday its annual list of the most-visited Wikipedia pages, showcasing what people wanted to read about this year. The crowdsourced encyclopedia offers a snapshot of what topics captivate the public, become global trends or define a specific year, similar to Oxford’s word of the year. English-language Wikipedia was viewed over 76 billion times globally this year as of October, according to the Wikimedia Foundation. “The most popular Wikipedia articles are a reflection of our world, highlighting our collective interests at a unique moment in time,” Anusha Alikhan, the chief communications officer at the Wikimedia Foundation, said in a statement. A list of deaths in 2024 was the most visited page, garnering over 44 million views. A page about deaths in a given year has ranked at the top of the list five times since 2015, when the Wikimedia Foundation began releasing the data. The topic has never fallen below third place on the list. People also searched for US political figures, celebrities like Taylor Swift and popular American movies, as well as global sporting events and the general election in India. ChatGPT, which was the top visited article in 2023, fell in its ranking to the 12th most visited page. US politics and pop culture dominated Wikipedia’s most viewed pages of 2024 were largely related to US popular culture and politics. Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 US presidential election were second and third on the list with nearly 29 million and 28 million views, respectively. And the 2020 US presidential election was the 13th most-visited page with views doubling in November. President-elect Donald Trump came in at number five. He has been on the list almost every year since 2015, dropping off in 2022 and 2023 before reappearing this year. Vice President-elect JD Vance was in the top 10, coming in seventh. Project 2025 also got a place in the top 10, coming in ninth with nearly 20 million views. Also in the top 25: Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who’s been chosen to lead the incoming administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” President Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick for health secretary. A page about Tim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota and vice-presidential candidate, did not appear in the top 25. But the data shows that he would have been 27th had the list been extended. While US politics was a notable search subject, popular culture had the largest share of the top 25. The fourth most-visited page was about Lyle and Erik Menendez, the brothers who were sentenced to life in prison for the 1989 murder of their parents and are now facing a resentencing trial. The case received renewed public attention after a Netflix documentary was published this year. The Wikipedia page about the brothers received over 26 million views in 2024. The “Deadpool & Wolverine” and “Dune: Part Two” movies were eighth and 23rd, respectively. In 2023, the movies “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” were in the top 25. Griselda Blanco, a Colombian drug trafficker known as the “Queen of Cocaine,” had a peak in views after a Netflix miniseries about her life was released this year, and her page received nearly 13.5 million views across the year. People also read up on celebrities throughout the year. Swift came in at 11th, down from ninth most-visited in 2023 when she first appeared on the list. The pop star completes her worldwide Eras Tour on December 8. Sean “Diddy” Combs made the top 25, as the rapper and music producer faces more than 30 civil lawsuits that include charges of sexual trafficking and racketeering. And the page about Liam Payne, the One Direction musician who died on October 16, garnered over 12 million views. His death sparked an outpouring of grief from fans, drawing crowds that gathered at vigils around the world to mourn the British pop star. Indian politics and culture were also among top searches on Wikipedia. “Wikipedia readers in India continue to make a big impact on the list, a trend we saw in 2023 as well,” Wikimedia Foundation’s Alikhan said. The Indian Premier League, a cricket league in India, garnered over 24.5 million views this year as the site’s sixth most visited page. The topic was the fourth most visited page in 2023, the first year it appeared on the list. The Indian general election also made the top 10. In June, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi was reelected in the country’s general election. The page about the election saw a peak of 1.2 million views on June 4, when the voting results were announced, and gained over 18 million views during the year. Bollywood movie “Kalki 2898 AD” saw 14.6 million views across the year, earning a spot in the top 25. In 2023, two Bollywood movies appeared on the top 25 list. The 2024 Summer Olympics, the UEFA Euro championship and Cristiano Ronaldo were also included in the top 25. Wikipedia launched in 2001 and is maintained by over 260,000 volunteer editors. There were over 31 million edits to the site in 2024 and almost 3.5 billion bytes of information were added, according to the Wikimedia Foundation. The editors who compiled the list screened for spam, bots and other inaccuracies that could disrupt the tally of page views, according to the Wikimedia Foundation.

"US trade policies are under the microscope after President Donald Trump enacted tariffs on top trading partner China and teased more, broader tariffs in the coming days. With Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, expected at the White House on Thursday, CNN takes a look at the trade relationship between the two countries. While India has been spared any tariffs from the new Trump administration so far, Trump said recently that reciprocal tariffs will be announced on any countries with tariffs on US goods, which would include India. Meanwhile, India could be mounting a case to avoid such tariffs, as the country has recently reviewed its trade policies in a move believed to entice additional trade with the US, according to several Reuters reports. Here is what you need to know about US-India trade: Where things stand The US is India’s largest trade partner as of 2024, yet India ranks tenth in the list of US trading partners for the same year. The bilateral trade between the US and the world’s most populous nation stands at $129.2 billion in 2024, a record for the partnership. With Trump planning to impose 25% tariffs on the US’s two top trade partners, Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff already in effect on Chinese goods, experts say India could benefit from these strained trade relationships by exporting more technology, electronics and jewelry to America. “The United States and India both want to enhance their economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region and blunt China’s economic primacy. The time is ripe and the incentives are in place for these two leaders to beat the odds and make a major deal,” wrote Kenneth I. Juster, US ambassador to India from 2017 to 2021, and Mark Linscott, assistant US trade representative for South and Central Asian affairs from 2016 to 2018, in a January 21 Foreign Policy article. The trade deficit between the US and India has been widening, with the United States importing $45.7 billion more from India than it exported there in 2024. And US imports from India accounted for about 2.7% of all imported goods last year. Trump has been vocal about Modi’s own penchant for tariffs, but there have been signs that the South Asian country is open to cooling on levies. Earlier this month, India’s finance minister slashed the import duty on motorcycles, a move benefiting American bike company Harley Davidson. What comes in and what goes out The US counts pearls, semi-precious stones, pharmaceutical products and electrical equipment among their top imports from India. In 2023, imports of the top five products going from India to the US totaled more than $47 billion. Modi is visiting Washington this week. The two leaders spoke on the phone on January 27, seven days after Trump’s inauguration, where they discussed expanding cooperation, security in the Indo-Pacific and the importance of India buying more US-made security equipment.",,0.20031456649303436
"Osamu Suzuki, an ingenious penny pincher who led Japan’s Suzuki Motor for more than four decades and played a key role in turning India into a flourishing auto market, has died aged 94. He died on December 25 of lymphoma, said the company, which he steered ambitiously, during his time as either chief executive or chairman, out of its primary market of minivehicles. The inexpensive, boxy, 660-cc cars specific to Japan benefited from generous tax breaks but demanded a stringent reining-in of costs that proved to be a key part of the automaker’s DNA. Even so, Suzuki’s thriftiness was legendary. He would order factory ceilings lowered to save on air-conditioning and fly economy class on airplanes even at an advanced age. “Forever,” or “until the day I die,” were signature humorous responses with which he parried queries about how long he would stay at the company, on which he retained a tight grip into his 70s and 80s. Born Osamu Matsuda, Suzuki took his wife’s family name through adoption in a practice common among Japanese families lacking a male heir. The former banker joined the company founded by her grandfather in 1958 and worked upwards through the ranks to become president two decades later. In the 1970s, he saved the company from the brink of collapse by convincing Toyota Motor to supply engines that met new emissions regulations, but which Suzuki Motor had yet to develop. More success followed with the 1979 launch of the Alto minivehicle, which became a massive hit, boosting the automaker’s bargaining power when it tied up with General Motors in 1981. A ‘people’s car’ for India Suzuki then took a big and risky decision to invest a year’s worth of the company’s earnings to build a national car maker for India. His personal interest was motivated by a strong desire “to be number one somewhere in the world,” he would later recall. At the time, India was an automotive backwater with annual car sales below 40,000, mainly British knock-offs. The government had just nationalized Maruti, set up in 1971 as a pet project of Sanjay Gandhi, son of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, to produce an affordable, “people’s car” made in India. Maruti needed a foreign partner, but early collaboration with Renault fell through as the sedan being considered was deemed too expensive and insufficiently fuel-efficient for domestic needs. The Maruti team knocked on many doors but was snubbed widely by brands including Fiat and Subaru and — by accident — Suzuki Motor. The partnership only came about after a Suzuki Motor director in India saw a newspaper article about a potential Maruti deal with Japanese small-car rival Daihatsu. He telephoned headquarters to learn that the Maruti team had been turned away. Suzuki then telexed Maruti and hastily invited the team back to Japan, asking for a second chance. A letter of intent was signed within months. The first car, the Maruti 800 hatchback based on the Alto, was launched in 1983, becoming an instant success. Today, Maruti Suzuki, majority-held by Suzuki Motor, still commands roughly 40% of India’s car market. In class-conscious India, Suzuki also ushered in change, insisting on equality in the workplace, ordering open-plan offices, a single canteen and uniforms for executives and assembly-line workers alike. Not all a success A month shy of his 80th birthday, Suzuki clinched a multibillion-dollar tie-up with giant Volkswagen in December 2009. Touted as a match made in heaven, it soon faltered, with Suzuki Motor accusing its new top shareholder of trying to control it, while VW objected to the Japanese firm’s purchase of diesel engines from Fiat. Suzuki Motor took VW to an international arbitration court in less than two years, eventually succeeding in buying back the stake of 19.9% it had sold to the German automaker. Suzuki, who often cited golf and work as the keys to his health, finally passed the baton as CEO to his son Toshihiro in 2016, and stayed on as chairman for another five years until age 91, keeping an advisory role until the end. Since 2016, his company has deepened ties with the world’s biggest carmaker Toyota, which acquired a 5% stake in Suzuki Motor in 2019. Maruti Suzuki is set to supply electric cars for Toyota from next year. “To me, he was more than an admired business leader: he was like a father,” Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda said in a Friday statement, honoring Suzuki as a trailblazer of minivehicles. “He was a father figure who developed Japan’s kei car (minivehicle) and nurtured it into Japan’s people’s car.”",,0.3845597207546234
"India’s IT ministry has unlawfully expanded censorship powers to allow the easier removal of online content and empowered “countless” government officials to execute such orders, Elon Musk’s X has alleged in a new lawsuit against New Delhi. The lawsuit and the allegations mark an escalation in an ongoing legal dispute between X and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government over how New Delhi orders content to be taken down. It also comes as Musk is getting closer to launching his other key ventures Starlink and Tesla in India. In the new court filing dated March 5, X argues India’s IT Ministry is asking other departments to use a government website launched by the Ministry of Home Affairs last year to issue content blocking orders and mandate social media companies to join the website too. This mechanism, X says, does not contain the stringent Indian legal safeguards on content removal that required such orders to be issued in cases such as harm to sovereignty or public order, and came with strict oversight of top officials. India’s IT ministry redirected a Reuters’ request for comment to the home affairs ministry, which did not respond. Related article

X’s court papers are not public and were reported for the first time by media on Thursday. The case was briefly heard earlier this week by a judge in the High Court of southern Karnataka state but no final decision was reached. It will now be heard on March 27. In 2021, X, formerly called Twitter, was locked in a stand-off with the Indian government over non-compliance of legal orders to block certain tweets related to a farmers’ protest against government policies. X later complied following public criticism by officials, but its legal challenge to the decision is continuing in Indian courts.",,0.21159520745277405
"At least 18 people were killed in a crowd crush at a New Delhi railway station Saturday as passengers tried to board trains heading to the world’s largest religious gathering, according to local media citing police. “18 people including 9 women and 5 children lost their lives in the stampede that occurred yesterday around 10 p.m. at New Delhi Railway station,” Delhi police told CNN affiliate CNN-News18 in a statement. Deputy commissioner of Delhi police KPS Malhotra told India’s ANI news that the crush took place late Saturday night, when delays to two train services and an influx of passengers led to overcrowding. He said the “situation went out of control for a brief spell of 10 to 15 minutes.” Many of those in the crowds are thought to have been heading to the Maha Kumbh Mela, the world’s largest religious gathering, in the Indian city of Prayagraj. The news comes just weeks after dozens of people were killed in a crowd crush at the gathering itself. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “distressed” at the latest deaths. “My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected,” Modi wrote on X Sunday. Related article

The entire team is working to assist all those who have been affected by this tragic incident,” he wrote. Vaishnaw said four trains had been used to evacuate people from the station. Police were on the scene and the situation was now under control, he added. The festival is considered the world’s largest peaceful gathering of people. Over six weeks, a staggering 400 million people are expected to attend the Maha Kumbh Mela, or the festival of the Sacred Pitcher, on the banks of Prayagraj.",,0.32877036929130554
"Jet fighters flew over a packed stadium in southern Pakistan, streaking the sky with the green and white of the national flag and garlanding a sporting spectacle the country has been waiting to host for a generation. The two teams strutted out into the National Stadium in Karachi to a huge roar from the crowd, getting underway the Champions Trophy tournament that cricket-obsessed Pakistan hopes will cement its rehabilitation into the cricketing world. Long roiled by Islamist militancy and terror attacks – including a deadly attack on a visiting Sri Lanka cricket team in 2009 – Pakistan has for years been off the roster for international tournaments. Now world cricket powerhouses like Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand and South Africa are here for around three weeks of cricket, and fans are ecstatic. Authorities in Karachi were taking no chances during the opening match between Pakistan and New Zealand on Wednesday. Snipers were in position on rooftops along routes to the stadium. Commandos and SWAT teams manned checkpoints around the sprawling port city. Farah Qadri spent hours under the blazing sun passing through security checkpoints outside the stadium, but said the “surreal” experience of seeing the opening game of the tournament was worth the wait. There were people from “all walks of life huddled together, cheering, chanting and dancing nonstop,” she told CNN. The Champions Trophy “is a huge positive for the entire country,” said Basit Ali, 36, who watched the opening match from a teashop in Peshawar near the Afghan border. “I pray that Pakistan successfully defends its title and brings joy to the nation.” Cricket is almost a second religion in Pakistan, with superstars plastered on billboards, and the national team the objects of intense pride – or anger – depending on results. But the last time Pakistan hosted an international tournament was in 1996. That’s meant an entire generation in the nation of around 220 million has come of age without experiencing the thrill of playing host to the world’s best. Excitement mingled with nervousness for Farees Shah, a cricket podcast host who also joined the throng of fans in the Karachi stadium on Wednesday. It’s like “you’re the biggest party animal out there but after ages you’re hosting the party, so you just want to make sure everything goes smoothly,” he told CNN. Events off the cricket pitch rarely go smoothly in Pakistan. Former prime minister – and World Cup-winning cricketer – Imran Khan is currently in jail for corruption and revealing official secrets – charges he says are a plot by rivals to keep him from returning to office. The country’s economy is tottering and reliant on IMF bailouts, while the powerful military is entrenched in every aspect of life, according to its critics. A long-running Taliban insurgency has killed tens of thousands, while authorities are also battling a festering and bloody separatist movement in the resource-rich southwest. Cricket has been caught up in the violence too. In 2009 Sri Lanka’s cricket team was attacked by militants on their way to a match in the northeastern city of Lahore. The gunmen sprayed the team bus with bullets as it neared the stadium, killing eight people – six policemen and two civilians – and leaving several of the visiting players wounded, sending shock waves across the cricket world. Pakistan was subsequently stripped of hosting rights for the 2009 Champions Trophy. A later militant attack caused the country to be ruled out of co-hosting the 2011 World Cup. Hosting the Champions Trophy is a “milestone moment” for Pakistan, the chairman of Pakistan’s Cricket Board (PCB) Mohsin Naqvi told CNN in a statement. The tournament is an “opportunity to reaffirm Pakistan’s status as one of the most passionate and influential cricketing nations, fully capable of staging multi-nation tournaments at the highest level,” he said. Authorities say they are pulling out all stops. The national airline is putting on special flights to ferry the visiting teams around the country to their matches. Every player and match official has been given “state guest status” according to authorities – the equivalent of being treated like a visiting head of state. The elephant in the room There is one hiccup, however. India, the top-ranked cricket team in the world – and Pakistan’s fiercest rival – isn’t coming to the party. Cricketing officials there have cited “security reasons” for refusing to come to Pakistan. India will play its matches instead in the United Arab Emirates. That decision has dampened the mood of fans globally and enraged Pakistani ones, denying the hosts the chance to face off against their neighbor and biggest rival on home turf. Related article
      ‘Five times the Super Bowl’: Why India vs Pakistan is a sporting rivalry like no other Since independence from Britain in 1947, nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars and introduced heavy restrictions on exchanges of goods and people, despite their closely entwined shared history and culture – and love of cricket. India-Pakistan matches are billed as one of the greatest sporting grudges in the world and attract mega sponsors and hyper fanfare. Around 400 million people are estimated to have tuned in to watch Pakistan beat India in the final of the last Champions Trophy in 2017. Viewing figures for the latest Super Bowl were paltry in comparison, at around 127 million. Naqvi, chairman of the PCB, called India’s absence “a loss for spectators, broadcasters, media, and the tournament itself.” “But it is also a missed opportunity for Indian players to experience the warmth, love, and hospitality that Pakistan has always extended to visiting teams.” CNN has contacted India’s cricket board for comment. For cricket fan Basit Ali in Peshawar, Sunday’s upcoming clash with India will be the highlight of the tournament, even if it does take place in Dubai. “The real excitement will be when Pakistan faces India. I can’t wait for that!” Farees Shah, the podcast host, told CNN he wanted “nothing more than Pakistan cricket to do well.” “It is equally important to me that the tournament goes effortlessly.”",,0.4022298753261566
"President Donald Trump doubled down on his extraordinary push for more balanced trade, ordering on Thursday that agencies should investigate plans for new reciprocal tariffs that could boost America’s revenue — but could also ignite a global trade war and add to America’s rebounding inflation problem. Howard Lutnick, Trump’s Commerce Secretary nominee, said he anticipates the investigation will be complete by April 1. It is then up to Trump to decide, as of April 2, when to enact any of the new recommended tariffs, he said. Reciprocal tariffs were one of Trump’s core campaign pledges — his method for evening the score with foreign nations that place taxes on American goods and to solve what he has said are unfair trade practices. “They charge us a tax or tariff and we charge them the exact same,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office before signing a memo dubbed the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan.” “Nobody knows what that number is unless you go by country,” Trump said. In calculating what reciprocal tariff rate to levy on other nations, he said his administration will also be taking into account nations with value-added tax (VAT), which he labeled “far more punitive than a tariff.” Related article
      US craft beers — brewed in steel, canned in aluminum — could get crushed by tariffs Trump said America needs a fairer trade policy that makes US goods more attractive on the market. “The United States is one of the most open economies in the world, yet our trading partners keep their markets closed to our exports,” according to a White House fact sheet outlining the plan. “This lack of reciprocity is unfair and contributes to our large and persistent annual trade deficit.” The announcement comes as Trump is scheduled to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After signing the memo, Trump singled out India, saying, “They charge more tariffs than any other country.” Trump and a fact sheet of the action specifically drew attention to tariffs India charges on motorcycles from the US. “I remember when Harley Davidson couldn’t sell their motorbikes into India because of the fact that .. the tax was so high,” Trump said. The fact sheet claimed India “charges a 100% tariff on U.S. motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.” Trump said India could potentially avoid new tariffs if they bring more production to the US. “If you build here, you have no tariffs whatsoever. And I think that’s what’s going to happen. I think our country is going to be flooded with jobs,” the president said. Why Trump is pursuing reciprocal tariffs The US currently has a weighted average import tariff rate of 2% on industrial goods, according to the US Trade Representative. Weighted average tariff rates give special consideration to the value of a country’s imports. That means that if one country’s exports are subject to tariffs in another country and they constitute a large portion of the country’s overall imports, their weighted average tariff rate will be higher compared to another country whose exports accounts for a small share. Industrial goods, an umbrella category that includes cars, clothing, oil and more, account for practically everything the US imports aside from agricultural goods. Half of all industrial goods the US imports have been entering the country duty-free, according to the USTR. U.S. President Donald Trump's potential tariffs on the global marketplace are looming over this year's World Governments Summit in Dubai. CNN's Anna Stewart and Becky Anderson discuss the mood and reactions from business leaders and dignitaries at the annual event. Related video
      World braces for Trump’s next tariff move “Our workers and industries bear the brunt of unfair practices and limited access to foreign markets,” the White House official said, noting how many countries charge much higher tariff rates on US exports. “This situation is untenable.” Tariffs are a key part of Trump’s plan to raise revenue to pay for the extension of his 2017 tax cut on top of other promised tax cuts. But the burden of tariffs could ultimately fall on American consumers, economists say — a potentially troubling self-inflicted wound as inflation has begun to creep higher again. “Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down,” Trump said Thursday. “So Americans should prepare for some short-term pain,” he added. Importers who pay the tariffs pass the costs on to retailers, which then raise prices for consumers. That has left some Trump proponents stunned and angry, including the Wall Street Journal editorial board, which snarkily asked: “Does President Trump understand money?” And Republican Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell in an op-ed in the Courier-Journal criticized Trump’s tariffs for threatening to inflict high costs on Kentuckians. If Americans can’t switch to cheaper alternatives as a result of the tariffs if enacted, they’ll probably wind up paying the cost of the tariffs, Justin Weidner, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said. But it also depends on whether manufacturers, retailers or other companies along the supply chain can absorb any of those costs themselves. Where tariffs could sting hardest The plans for these new tariffs are aimed at countries with some of the widest trade deficits with the US as well as differences in tariff rates charged on US goods brought into their countries compared to what the US charges them. The tariffs could hit developing countries particularly hard, especially India, Brazil, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian and African countries, given that they have some of the widest differences in tariff rates charged on US goods brought into their countries compared to what the US charges them. For instance, in 2022, the US average tariff rate on imports from India was 3%, whereas India’s average tariff rate on imports from the US was 9.5%, according to World Bank data. However, given Trump is meeting with Modi on Thursday, the two leaders could reach an agreement that avoids or delays new tariffs on Indian exports to the US. Last year, India exported $87 billion worth of goods to the US, while the US exported $42 billion worth of goods, according to Commerce Department data. But the focus on countries with a VAT, as opposed to just tariffs, means European Union countries like Germany, Ireland and Italy – some of America’s biggest trading partners – could face higher tariff rates. Some of those nations’ biggest exports to the US include pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, cars and car parts, all of which could get more expensive under higher tariffs. Enacting reciprocal tariffs in response to countries with VAT is “just going to be starting a trade war,” Aaron Klein, a former deputy assistant secretary at the Treasury Department who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CNN anchors on Thursday. The reciprocal tariffs join the 10% across-the-board tariff that went into effect last week on top of other tariffs on Chinese goods and stricter 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that Trump announced on Monday. If Trump goes forward with the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that were pushed back until March 1, the total direct cost of the import taxes on Chinese, Mexican and Canadian goods would equate to a tax hike of more than $1,200 per year for the typical American household, Peterson Institute researchers have found. Reciprocal tariffs would likely add to that amount. US stocks rally off delay Wall Street seemed largely unfazed Thursday, with some investors betting Trump’s bark will be worse than his bite. US markets began to climb after Trump’s afternoon announcement as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the president didn’t end up immediately enacting new reciprocal tariffs. The Dow ended the day up 343 points, or 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose by 1.5% and the S&P 500 added 1%. “It’s like everything else: He says something with bombast, and then dials back,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. “We fear the worst and then realize it’s all part of the art of the deal.” Block noted that Trump delayed, at the last minute, tariffs that were scheduled to take effect earlier this month on Canada and Mexico. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Wealth, said investors suspect tariffs will once again be used as a bargaining chip and may not be as severe or immediate as feared. “It’s not like tomorrow we’re going to suddenly have 50% tariffs across the board,” Lerner said. Still, even the threat of tariffs can cause uncertainty that depresses business investment and could cause the Federal Reserve to further delay interest rate cuts.

"An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi, India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday afternoon after it was diverted due to a security concern, which later proved to be “non-credible,” the airline said. American Airlines said Flight 292 “was inspected by law enforcement” after landing at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport and “cleared to re-depart.” It didn’t clarify the cause of the security concern, but added an inspection was required by protocol before the flight could land in New Delhi. “The flight will stay in Rome overnight to allow for required crew rest before continuing to Delhi as soon as possible tomorrow,” the airline said. An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. Neeraj Chopra, one of the passengers on board, said the captain announced that the plane had to turn around about three hours before it was supposed to land in New Delhi because of a change in “security status.” Chopra, who was traveling from Detroit, Michigan to visit family, described the mood on the plane as calm after the initial announcement but said he began to feel stressed when the captain later announced that fighter jets would be escorting their plane to Rome. “I felt a little panic of, okay, what’s going on here?” Chopra told the AP. “There’s got to be like something bigger going on here.” Passenger Jonathan Bacon, 22, from Dayton, Ohio, started paying attention to the flight tracker on the seatback in front of him after the captain’s announcement of a “diversion due to a security issue,” observing the plane’s sharp turn away from New Delhi and route back toward Rome. Passengers had no internet connection for much of the flight, Bacon said, with only some spotty access that clued them into early reports of the situation about two hours before landing. After landing, Bacon said all passengers were loaded onto buses and taken to the terminal, where each passenger and their personal items underwent additional security screenings that were time-consuming and felt “slightly heightened,” especially for arrivals. More than two hours after landing, Bacon and his friend said they were still waiting for their checked baggage, which they said was also undergoing security screenings. “It was definitely the longest flight to Europe I’ve ever taken,” Bacon said. A spokesperson for the airport said it was continuing to operate normally.",,0.27812567353248596
"Editor’s Note: This article contains details that readers may find distressing. Five years ago, a 13-year-old girl, the daughter of poor wage laborers from one of India’s most marginalized communities, was allegedly sexually abused by one of her neighbors in the village where she lived. Her alleged abuser filmed it and police are investigating whether he used the images to blackmail and manipulate the girl into being raped and sexually abused by dozens of other men and boys over the next five years. Police say the allegations only came to light after the girl, now 18, spoke to a counselor visiting her college in Kerala state and detailed the years of horrific abuse. A total of 58 men and boys have been arrested and accused of the sexual assault, rape and gang rape of the girl. Another two men wanted in connection with the case have fled the country, Kerala Police Deputy Inspector General Ajeetha Begum told CNN. Among the accused are her schoolmates, her relatives, her neighbors – men from all corners of her life, ranging from minors to men in their mid-40s, according to case documents reviewed by CNN and interviews with local police. Charges have not yet been filed and the 58 men remain in detention. None of the accused has spoken publicly about the allegations. Under Indian rape laws, the girl has not been identified. Violence against women is rampant in India due to entrenched sexism and patriarchy, despite laws being amended to include more severe punishments for abusers. In August the rape and murder of a trainee medic in the eastern city of Kolkata sparked a nationwide doctors’ strike that brought tens of thousands into the streets to demand change. The Kerala case has not sparked similar outrage. Experts and activists say that’s because the victim is from the Dalit community at the bottom of the Hindu caste system, a 3,000-year-old social and religious hierarchy that categorizes people at birth and defines their place in society. Dalits traditionally carry out occupations viewed as ritually “unclean” by Hindu scripture, such as manual scavenging, waste picking and street sweeping. They are often banned from visiting temples and forced to live apart from higher-caste communities, often in squalor and farther from access to services. Despite legislation banning discrimination based on caste, activists say the stigma leaves India’s more than 260 million Dalits vulnerable to abuse and less able to seek redress for crimes committed against them. “When it’s Dalit women, in general the outrage is less across the country,” said Cynthia Stephen, a Dalit rights activist and social policy researcher. There is a sense that “this girl is not ‘one of us,’” she said. Manipulated, kidnapped and abused The alleged abuse began when the young man from the village molested the girl and took sexually explicit videos and photos, police told CNN. At least three of her abusers promised to marry her, according to police. One threatened to kill her if she reported the abuse. Some of the men acted alone, police said. But others are accused of gang rape. “It’s not that all the cases are connected. But in one case, there might be four or five accused,” said Begum, from Kerala Police. Many of the men contacted the young girl on her father’s phone, through social media apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp, late at night after he went to sleep, police said. The alleged abuse took place in private and public spaces, in homes and in cars, at bus stops and in fields. Some of the cases allegedly involved men who were strangers, living in towns dozens of miles away. Some of the cases involve allegations of human trafficking, because the men forced the girl to travel outside her village, police said. The allegations have sent shock waves through the girl’s village in the green hills of Kerala, where many work as wage laborers in low-paid jobs like construction and farming. Police say the girl’s parents worked long hours and did not know about the alleged abuse of their daughter. When the allegations emerged in January, some women in the community were sympathetic toward the accused and angry at the survivor, according to local media outlet The News Minute. The women criticized the girl’s clothing and lifestyle and blamed her mother for not watching over her more closely, The News Minute reported. One mother, whose son was among the accused, said he was innocent. She said he had known the girl since she was a baby and “had raised the girl in his arms,” according to the outlet. ‘Monsters in her own backyard’ More than half of Dalits in Kerala live in designated areas called “colonies,” known for cramped and harsh living conditions, after years of being denied land ownership under historical laws. Many women and girls living in these colonies lack resources and privacy, making them more vulnerable to abuse, Rekha Raj, a Dalit feminist activist from Kerala, told CNN. Madhumita Pandey, a professor in criminology and gender justice at Sheffield Hallam University in the United Kingdom, said the tight-knit nature of communities such as these colonies could explain why the alleged abuse of the teenage girl was not reported until recently. “They could sometimes be your friend, uncle or neighbor,” she said. It can be harder to report abuse when “the so-called monsters are in our own backyard,”  she said. Official statistics support her point: the alleged perpetrator is known to the victim in more than 98% of reported rape cases in Kerala, according to government data. There were 4,241 reported cases of rape against women from oppressed castes in India, including Dalit women, in 2022, the most recent year for which data exists, according to India’s National Crime Records Bureau. That’s equivalent to more than 10 rapes per day. There were more than 31,500 rapes reported overall in 2022, according to the NCRB. However, given the difficulties in reporting such crimes, especially for the Dalit community, the true figure is likely higher. Furthermore, in close communities, and especially in Dalit communities, women and girls also risk isolating themselves or being seen as bringing dishonor upon their families if they report abuse, Pandey said. In at least 16 of the cases from the alleged Kerala village abuse, the accused men are from more privileged castes, according to police. If found guilty, these men could face harsher punishments under Indian laws designed to protect disadvantaged castes. A 2020 report by the NGO Equality Now found that sexual violence is used by dominant castes to oppress Dalit women and girls, who are often denied justice because of a “prevalent culture of impunity, particularly when the perpetrators are from a dominant caste.” Even when Dalit women report sexual abuse, they face an uphill battle to justice. The Equality Now report followed 40 cases of rape against Dalit women and girls, and the seven cases that resulted in convictions involved either rape and murder together or were committed against girls under the age of 6.

      A trainee doctor’s rape and murder sparked mass protests in India. A man has now been charged N Rajeev, the head of the Child Welfare Committee in Pathanamthitta, the Kerala district where the girl is from, said an increase in reported child sexual abuse cases was in part thanks to campaigns in schools that help children identify and disclose abuse. The number of reported child sexual abuse cases in the state has surged to 4,663 in 2023, more than four times the 1,002 reported in 2013, according to government data. The Dalit girl is now living in a shelter where she is receiving counseling and support, Begum, the police officer, said. The girl’s mother is also being given counseling and has the option to stay in a women’s shelter if she feels unsafe in the neighborhood. Begum said police have dedicated “maximum manpower” to the case. The case will likely take years to go through the courts. Across India, rape has one of the lowest conviction rates of major crimes, with 27% of cases resulting in convictions in 2022, according to the NCRB. While child sexual abuse continues to be a “a grim reality” in Kerala, the fact that the Dalit girl was able to report the case is a step in the right direction, Stephen said. “Otherwise, this would have just gone on unreported for years on end, then she would have nobody to help her.” CNN’s Aishwarya S Iyer, Monica Sarkar and journalist N.
